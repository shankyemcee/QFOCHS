The disparate trends in the jobs recovery from 2009 to 2011 reflect the rapidly changing demographics of the American workforce. Although jobs growth for Hispanics and Asians was more rapid than for other groups, it merely kept pace with the growth in their working - age ( ages 16 and older ) populations. The slower rate of jobs growth for whites and blacks reflects the relatively slow growth in their populations. Thus, the share of each group ’s population that is employed, the employment rate, has barely risen since the end of the recession, according to new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.

About three - quarters of Catholics ( 77 % ) now view the pope favorably, which is 10 percentage points lower than the share who did so in January 2017 ( 87 % ) but not statistically different from the ratings recorded in January or September 2018. ( Even though the 2018 and 2020 surveys produced different estimates of the share of Catholics who view Pope Francis favorably, the differences between the current survey and each of the surveys conducted in 2018 do not pass a test of statistical significance. ) A January 2018 survey found growing partisan polarization in views of Pope Francis, with Catholi

The demographic of the state ’s Hispanic population are growing more diverse. In 2014, Cubans made up a smaller share ( 31 % ) of Hispanic eligible voters – adult U.S. citizens – in Florida than they did in 1990 ( 46 % ). Meanwhile, over the same period, Puerto Ricans made up a larger share of the state ’s Hispanic eligible voters, rising from 25 % to 27 %. These changes have been driven by the outmigration of Puerto Ricans from the island to central Florida and the movement of Puerto Rican - origin Hispanics in the northeast U.S. to central Florida.

The rise of Eurosceptic political parties on both the left and the right. When asked about leading nontraditional political parties, half or more of the publics in four of the six EU nations surveyed believe that these parties are good for their country because they raise important issues that are ignored by traditional parties. This is especially true in France, where among those who say the Eurosceptic party National Front is a good thing, people have a more negative view of the EU and think the European project has weakened France.

The gender gap in 2008 – the seven - point difference between women and men in support for the Democratic candidate – was comparable to the gap in most elections since 1980. Even when Democratic candidates failed to garner a majority of the women ’s vote – as in 1980, 1984 and 1988 – they still drew more support from women than from men. The election of 1992 was unusual because of Ross Perot ’s popular third - party campaign. Still, the gender gap was significant : Women backed Bill Clinton over George H.W. Bush, 45 % to 37 %, with 17 % supporting Perot. Clinton had a narrower lead amon

The nation ’s unauthorized immigrant population grew rapidly between 1990 and 2007, reaching a peak of 12.2 million. Since then, the population declined to 10.5 million in 2017. Unauthorized immigrants from Mexico make up less than half of all unauthorized immigrants and have been a driver of the group ’s population decline – the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico fell from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 4.9 million in 2017.


The South continues to be home to many of America ’s poor, though to a lesser degree than a half - century ago. In 1960, half ( 49 % ) of poor Americans lived in the South. By 2010, that share had dropped to 41 %. Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period. As rural areas, such as in the Midwest, have become less impoverished since the 1960s, those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall.

The Japanese public is generally critical of the national government ’s response to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. A major exception is the country ’s Self Defense Force ( SDF ), which earns widespread praise for its response to the disasters. More than nine - in - ten ( 95 % ) say the SDF has done a good job responding to the crisis, including 62 % who say the force has done a very good job. A smaller majority ( 54 % ) give Japan ’s news organizations, such as television, radio, newspapers and magazines, favorable marks for their handling of the disaster. However, only 10

The public is divided on the war ’s progress.

A September CBS News / New York Times poll found a similar 35%-53 % positive - negative split on the war ’s progress.

The indications for that are not so good. Recent months have shown signs of economic progress and indications that the Affordable Care Act has begun to achieve its goals.
