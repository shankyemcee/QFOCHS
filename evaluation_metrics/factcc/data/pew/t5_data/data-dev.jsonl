This report was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts , which received support for the surveys from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation . But the bottom line is this : Across 10 measures that Pew Research Center has tracked on the same surveys since 1994 , the average partisan gap has increased from 15 percentage points to 36 points . Two decades ago , the average partisan differences on these items were only somewhat wider than differences by religious attendance or educational attainment and about as wide as the differences between blacks and whites ( 14 points , on average ) . Today , the party divide is much wider than any of these demographic differences .\n", "label": "CONSISTENT"}, {"id": "237", "text": "One - in Three Americans ( 34 % ) paid very close attention to news about the presidential campaign and roughly the same proportion ( 32 % ) listed this as their most closely followed story of the week .
