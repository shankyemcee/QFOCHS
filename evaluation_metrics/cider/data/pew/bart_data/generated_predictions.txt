Since Donald Trump took office as president, the image of the United States has suffered across many regions of the globe. As a new 13 - nation Pew Research Center survey illustrates, America ’s reputation has declined further over the past year among many key allies and partners. In several countries, the share of the public with a favorable view of the U.S. is as low as it has been at any point since the Center began polling on this topic nearly two decades ago
fully 77 % of all adults think it is generally OK for people to use their cellphones while walking down the street and 75 % believe it is OK for others to use phones on public transit.
A majority of Americans ( 61 % ) say it is very important that the tone of debate among political leaders is respectful.
In the wake of Trump ’s election, there has been an increase in the share of Republicans who think the country will be less divided five years from now. Still, just 36 % of Republicans say this.
Since March, the share of all registered voters who say it is more important for a presidential candidate to have “ new ideas and a different approach ” has surged – with virtually all of the increase coming among Republican and Republican - leaning voters.
