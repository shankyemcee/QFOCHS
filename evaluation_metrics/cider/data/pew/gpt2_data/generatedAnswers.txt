The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Oct. 25 - 30 among 1,504 adults, finds that Trump ’s job rating is lower than it was in June and February ( 39 % on each occasion ). Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president, with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ).

The Chinese public stands out from others surveyed in saying they prefer teaching both sets of skills. More than a quarter of Chinese volunteer that schools should emphasize both creative thinking and basic skills and discipline. This may be due in part to their educational system ’s reliance on standardized testing ( the gaokao ). While rote memorization and discipline are seen as keys for success on this future - defining exam, there is much handwringing domestically about how gaokao preparation comes at the expense of more creative opportunities. Younger, wealthier and better educated Chinese are particularly likely to prioritize imagination and creativity in the classroom.

( The share of workers represented by unions is a bit higher, 11.7 %, because about 1.6 million workers who are n’t union members are in jobs covered by a union contract. ) The actual number of union members was 14.7 million last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ). In 2012, union membership hit its lowest point since the current data series began in the early 1980


The answer given by those who have graduated from college is that their feelings of personal satisfaction and economic well - being are about the same, no matter which type of institution they attended, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey. Majorities of each group were satisfied with their family life, financial situation and current job. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of those three measures on overall satisfaction, though private school graduates were somewhat more likely than public school graduates to say they were “ very satisfied ” with their personal financial situation ( 44 % vs. 34 % ).

In fact, in every country surveyed, more name the U.S. than China – though opinion is relatively divided in several countries.
About their party, Democrats are far more concerned that congressional Democrats will not do enough, rather than go too far, to oppose Trump. The latest survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 7 - 12 among 1,503 adults, shows how members of both parties are coming to grips with Washington ’s changed political dynamics : Democrats want their party to challenge Trump.

The apparent coup d’etat in Zimbabwe may bring an end to the 37 - year - long rule of President Robert Mugabe. It ’s the first such seizure of power globally in three years – a reminder of how much rarer coups have become as methods of regime change.

The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives and few Hispanic cultural links, according to a follow - up open - ended question. For example, some 27 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic because they have a mixed Hispanic and non - Hispanic background or that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant. Another 16 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic despite their Hispanic ancestry because of their upbringing or that they have little contact with their Hispanic relatives ; 15 % said the reason they say they are not Hispanic is because they do not speak Spanish or have no link to Hispanic culture ; 12 % said the

The online announcement, however, are still very much in the minority. Since the 2004 election cycle, 27 of the 41 candidates who appeared in the Republican or Democratic presidential primary debates ( or have announced for 2016 ) included a public address in their formal announcement, according to our calculations. ( Sometimes, candidates have also made the announcement on some other platform, as in 2003 when former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, announced on The Daily Show before giving a formal speech. ) In that election cycle, twice as many Republican candidates ( eight ) made their announcements through a TV or radio appearance than did through formal speeches ( four )

The disparate trends in the jobs recovery from 2009 to 2011 reflect the rapidly changing demographics of the American workforce. Although jobs growth for Hispanics and Asians was more rapid than for other groups, it merely kept pace with the growth in their working - age ( ages 16 and older ) populations. The slower rate of jobs growth for whites and blacks reflects the relatively slow growth in their populations. Thus, the share of each group ’s population that is employed, the employment rate, has barely risen since the end of the recession, according to new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.


About a quarter of white adults ( 23 % ) said the same. Still, majorities in all three groups said they need to take breaks from this news from time to time ( 76 % of white, 63 % of Hispanic and 60 % of black adults ).

The question asks respondents whether they consider themselves Taiwanese, Chinese or both. A mere 4 % see themselves as only Chinese. These findings are consistent with other polls showing that people in Taiwan increasingly identify only as Taiwanese as opposed to both Taiwanese and Chinese or solely Chinese. Adults in Taiwan across all age groups are likely to see themselves as Taiwanese. At least six - in - ten in each group claim a Taiwanese identity, while no more than about a third hold a mixed or solely Chinese identity. Still, those ages 18 to 29 are more than 20 percentage points more likely than those 50 and older to see themselves as Taiwanese.

About the globe, people associate a number of negative characteristics with the U.S. leader. Most say he is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, while few think of him as well - qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people. Describing Trump as charismatic is more common, although global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic either. They do, however, see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55 % across the nations polled describe him this way.

Major economic news also drew heavy coverage and widespread interest last week. In all, the national news media devoted 19 % of its coverage to the economy ; 10 % of the coverage was focused on Bush ’s economic stimulus plan and 5 % was focused on major fluctuations in the stock market.

Even more notably, 88 % have used a public library website in the past year — almost three times the rate of the Americans population overall ( 30 % ). This is probably due to a basic self - selection bias : In general, people who are highly engaged with libraries are more likely to take a “ library user type ” quiz in the first place.
The vast majority of U.S. Muslims say belief in God is essential ( 85 % ) to their religious identity, according to a Pew Research Center survey of 1,001 U.S. Muslims conducted between January and May of this year.

The large drop in new arrivals is almost entirely due to a drop in the number of Mexican unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S. In 2017, Mexicans accounted for 20 % of unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. in the previous five years, compared with 52 % in 2007. This represents a decrease in the average annual inflow of Mexican unauthorized immigrants, from about 375,000 per year in 2002 - 2007 to about 90,000 per year for 2012 - 2017. For other regions of birth, the average annual inflows did not change significantly, but the shares of the total increased due to declining Mexican arrivals. The numbe

The U.S. economy employed 2 million fewer persons in the fourth quarter of 2008 than it employed in the fourth quarter of 2007. Among major racial and ethnic groups, only native - born Hispanics added jobs in the past year. But this was principally a function of demographics. The native - born Latino labor force is increasing more rapidly than the labor force for any other group—4.8 % compared with only 0.7 % growth in the U.S. labor force. Thus, as workers retire or leave employment for other reasons, they are increasingly likely to be replaced by native - born Hispanics.
