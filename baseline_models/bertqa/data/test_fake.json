{"1178":["1178.png","Married adults have a more positive view of how things are going in their relationship","As marriage rates have declined, the share of U.S. adults who have ever lived with an unmarried partner has risen. Amid these changes, most Americans find it acceptable for unmarried couples to live together, even for those who don’t plan to get married, according to a new Pew Research Center study. Still, a narrow majority sees societal benefits in marriage. The study also explores the experiences of adults who are married and those who are living with a partner, finding that married adults express higher levels of relationship satisfaction and trust in their partner than do those who are cohabiting. Here are seven key findings from the report: 1 A larger share of adults have cohabited than have been married. Among adults ages 18 to 44, 59% have lived with an unmarried partner at some point in their lives, while 50% have ever been married, according to Pew Research Center analysis of the National Survey of Family Growth. By contrast, in 2002, 54% of adults in this age group had ever cohabited and 60% had ever married. Most adults ages 18 to 44 who have cohabited (62%) have only ever lived with one partner, but 38% have had two or more partners over the course of their life. Looking at present relationships, 53% of adults ages 18 and older are currently married, down from 58% in 1995, according to data from the Current Population Survey. Over the same period, the share of Americans who are living with an unmarried partner has risen from 3% to 7%. 2 Most Americans (69%) say cohabitation is acceptable even if a couple doesn’t plan to get married. Another 16% say it’s acceptable, but only if the couple plans to marry, and 14% say it’s never acceptable for an unmarried couple to live together. Younger adults are more likely than their older counterparts to find it acceptable for an unmarried couple to live together. About eight-in-ten adults younger than age 30 (78%) say that cohabitation is acceptable even if the couple doesn’t plan to marry, compared with 71% of those ages 30 to 49, 65% of those 50 to 64 and 63% of those 65 and older. While most Americans say cohabitation is acceptable, many see societal benefits in marriage. A narrow majority of Americans (53%) say that society is better off if couples who want to stay together long-term eventually get married, while 46% say society is just as well off if they decide not to marry. 3 Married adults have higher levels of relationship satisfaction and trust than those living with a partner. Married adults are more likely than those who are living with a partner to say things are going very well in their relationship (58% vs. 41%). They also express higher levels of satisfaction with specific aspects of their relationship, including the way household chores are divided between them and their spouse or partner, how well their spouse or partner balances work and personal life, how well they and their spouse or partner communicate, and their spouse’s or partner’s approach to parenting (among those with children younger than 18 in the household). When it comes to their sex lives, however, similar shares of married and cohabiting adults (about a third) say they are very satisfied. Married adults are also more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly. The link between marriage (vs. cohabitation) and higher levels of relationship satisfaction and trust remains even after controlling for demographic differences between married and cohabiting adults (such as gender, age, race, religious affiliation and educational attainment). 4 Many cohabiting adults see living together as a step toward marriage. About two-thirds of married adults (66%) who lived with their spouse before they were married (and who were not yet engaged when they moved in together) say they saw cohabitation as a step toward marriage. Among cohabiting adults who were not engaged when they moved in with their partner, 44% say they saw living together as a step toward marriage. Among cohabiters who are not currently engaged, half of those with a bachelor’s degree or more education and 43% of those with some college experience say they saw moving in with their partner as step toward marriage. Smaller shares of those with a high school diploma or less education (28%) say the same. When U.S. adults are asked about the impact that living together first might have on the success of a couple’s marriage, roughly half (48%) say that, compared with couples who don’t live together before marriage, couples who do live together first have a better chance of having a successful marriage. Another 13% say they have a worse chance and 38% say it doesn’t make much difference. Younger adults are particularly likely to see cohabitation as a path to a successful marriage: 63% of adults younger than 30 say couples who live together before marriage have a better chance at a successful marriage, compared with 52% of those ages 30 to 49, 42% of those 50 to 64 and 37% of those 65 and older. 5 About four-in-ten cohabiting adults cite finances (38%) and convenience (37%) as major reasons they moved in with their partner. By comparison, just 13% of married adults cite finances and 10% cite convenience as major reasons why they decided to get married. Among both married and cohabiting adults, love and companionship top the list of reasons why they decided to get married or to move in with their partner. Nine-in-ten married adults and 73% of cohabiting adults say love was a major factor in their decision. About two-thirds of married adults and 61% of cohabiting adults cite companionship as a major factor. Cohabiting women are more likely than cohabiting men to say love and wanting to have children someday were major reasons why they moved in with their partner. For example, 80% of cohabiting women cite love as a major factor, compared with 63% of cohabiting men. No gender differences are evident on this question among married adults. 6 Many non-engaged cohabiters who want to get married someday cite finances as a reason why they’re not engaged or married. About three-in-ten cohabiting adults who are not engaged but say they would like to get married someday cite their partner’s (29%) or their own (27%) lack of financial readiness as a major reason why they’re not engaged or married to their current partner. About a quarter (24%) say their partner not being ready financially is a minor reason, and 29% say the same about their own finances. Roughly four-in-ten (44%) say not being far enough along in their job or career is at least a minor reason why they’re not engaged or married to their partner. Cohabiters who are not engaged but want to get married someday are more likely to cite their partner not being ready (26%), rather than themselves (14%), as a major reason they’re not engaged or married. 7 Most Americans favor allowing unmarried couples to have the same legal rights as married couples. Roughly two-thirds of adults (65%) say they favor allowing unmarried couples to enter into legal agreements that would give them the same rights as married couples when it comes to things like health insurance, inheritance or tax benefits, while 34% oppose this. Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are far more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to favor allowing these types of legal agreements for unmarried couples. About three-quarters of Democrats (77%) favor this, including 45% who strongly favor it. By contrast, Republicans are about evenly split: 50% favor and 49% oppose this. Party differences are also evident in views concerning the acceptability of cohabitation, the societal benefits of marriage, the impact of cohabitation on the success of a couple’s marriage and whether cohabiting and married couples can raise children equally well.

In particular, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that most Democrats and younger adults are convinced that these public events will help the causes of scientists. By contrast, Republicans and older adults believe the marches will not raise public support for scientists, aid efforts to increase government funding of science, enhance the role of scientists in policy debates or lead to increased efforts to combat global climate change. Overall, 44% of adults think the protests, marches and demonstrations will boost public support for science, while an equal share believe the protests will make no difference and 7% believe the demonstrations will actually hurt the cause. But on this and other questions about the marches there are consistent divides along political and generational lines. For example, 61% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the marches will increase public support for science, while only 22% of Republicans and those who lean Republican say the same. Instead, 60% of these Republican backers think the protests will make no difference, compared with just 32% of Democratic partisans who think that. Younger adults (ages 18 to 29) are particularly likely to think the marches will increase public support for science (55%). In contrast, 54% of seniors 65 and older believe the recent science marches will make no difference to public support for science; just 29% say the marches will help. These are some of the findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted among a nationally representative sample of 1,012 adults, ages 18 or older from May 3-7, 2017. The March for Science, which took place on April 22, stemmed from a Reddit thread made on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day. A number of groups were involved in planning the event held in Washington, D.C., and some 600 other locations around the world. The People’s Climate March was organized before the 2016 election and held April 29 to voice support for action to address global climate change. Rather than being in support of one specific policy outcome, marchers said there were a number of reasons they participated in the two science marches held in close sequence at the end of April. Americans render a split verdict about the marches and their impact, though a majority (59%) thinks that the protests will be effective in encouraging scientists to be more active in civic and public affairs. But on this and other possible impacts from these marches, there are consistent divides between political party groups: By one main measure, the marches about science have registered with Americans: They have drawn a share of public attention. Roughly six-in-ten Americans say they have heard a lot (24%) or a little (37%) about the protests, marches and demonstrations about science held this April. More than a third (37%) say they have heard nothing at all. Overall, 48% of Americans say they “support” or “strongly support” the goals of the pro-science marches, while 26% “oppose” or “strongly oppose” the goals of the demonstrations and 26% say they don’t know how they feel about them. Support for the goals of the science marches is divided by political party. Republicans and Republican leaners oppose the goals of the science marches by a 47%-25% margin; some 29% are undecided about their views. Democrats and Democratic leaners support the goals of the marches by a 68%-14% margin, with 18% undecided. People who have heard about the recent science marches are largely supportive of the protesters’ goals. Those who have heard at least a little about the recent science marches support the goals of the science marchers by a margin of 61% to 27%. Americans are closely divided on the issue of whether the marches will increase public support for science: 44% think they will help and 44% think they will make no difference. Another 7% believe they will hurt public support. Most Democrats and Democratic leaners (61%) believe the marches and demonstrations held in April will benefit public support for science. By contrast, just 22% of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP say the marches will help drive public support for science, while six-in-ten (60%) of this group believes the marches will have no impact on public support and 13% say the marches will hurt public support. While there are sizable partisan divisions on these issues, the differences between younger and older adults are also striking. When it comes to backing the goals of the protesters, 56% of those ages 18 to 29 “support” or “strongly support” the goals of the marchers, while just 36% of those 65 and older say they back the goals of the marchers. And in terms of perceived impact, 72% of those ages 18 to 29 think the marches will encourage scientists to be more active in civic affairs, compared with 47% of those ages 65 and older. Some 62% of younger adults believe the protests will raise support for government funding of science, while only 36% of those 65 and older say this. Additionally, 61% of younger adults think the protests will encourage policymakers to rely more on the advice of scientific experts, versus 43% of adults 65 and older. Younger adults are also more likely to think the protests and demonstrations will lead to public support for science: 55% of adults younger than 30 believe the recent marches and demonstrations will help public support for science, compared with 29% of those ages 65 and older. These differences by age hold even when accounting for the tendency of older adults to identify with the GOP. There are no notable demographic differences in views about the recent science protests by gender or education. President Trump’s election signaled major changes to federal policy connected with science, particularly for climate and environmental policies but also for funding science research at NASA, the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. Many in the scientific community have voiced concern about Trump’s views about science issues, particularly childhood vaccines and climate change, and have raised concerns about the appointment and role of science advisers in guiding policy decisions in the coming years. Asked whether the pro-science demonstrators were driven to act by the Trump administration’s handling of science issues, 48% say they think opposition to Trump was a major reason people participated, 22% say it was a minor reason, 17% say it was not a reason at all and 13% say they do not know. Fully 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say opposition to Trump was a major reason for marchers’ participation, compared with 36% of Republicans and Republican leaners who say this. Those following news about the recent science marches are particularly likely to believe that opposition to the new administration’s handling of science issues is a motivating factor for the recent protests. Some 55% of those who had heard at least a little about these marches say opposition to the Trump administration’s handling of science issues was a major reason for the protests, compared with 37% who had heard nothing about these science marches. When asked about news coverage of protests, marches and demonstrations these days – whether the cause is related to science or something else – 41% of Americans say the media give too much coverage to demonstrations these days compared with recent years, 31% believe the coverage is about the right amount and 24% think there is too little coverage. Here, too, there are differences in views by party and age. Fully 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations, while 18% think the amount of coverage has been about right and 11% say there has been too little coverage. By contrast, 43% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think there has been the right amount of coverage, 29% think there has been too little and 26% say there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations these days. Half (50%) of those ages 65 and older believe there has been too much media coverage of protests, marches and demonstrations these days; in contrast, 34% of those 18 to 29 think there has been too much coverage.","Americans are closely divided on the issue of whether the marches will increase public support for science : 44 % think they will help and 44 % think they will make no difference .

The SDGs call for countries to improve across 17 issue areas, including economic growth, accountable institutions and reduced inequality, among others. While the target for achieving the SDG goals is not until the year 2030, the publics in three major African nations are increasingly concerned about some key development issues. At the same time, they express considerable optimism about the future. In South Africa and Nigeria – sub-Saharan Africa’s two largest economies – economic sentiments have turned sharply negative since 2015. Around seven-in-ten South Africans and Nigerians now say their economies are in bad shape. Meanwhile, in the East African economic hub of Kenya, just over half say the same. Large majorities in all three countries consider the lack of employment opportunities a very big problem. Moreover, as a new Pew Research Center survey of these three major African nations illustrates, many believe the political and economic system is stacked against them. Political corruption – seen by many experts as a key stumbling block to a country’s development – is a major public concern. Broad majorities in all three countries name government corruption as a very big problem. Most South Africans, Kenyans and Nigerians believe that government is run for the benefit of only a few groups of people in society. And, perhaps most troublingly, only around a third of South Africans and Kenyans say government corruption will be better in their countries when today’s children grow up. Nigerians are more optimistic that there will be less corruption in the future – 60% expect things to improve. In the economic realm, most see rewards and opportunities going primarily to those at the top. Majorities in all three nations say the gap between rich and poor has increased over the past five years. And when asked why so many people lack jobs in their country, the top reason given is that many jobs go only to people with connections. Despite these concerns, there is considerable optimism about the future across the three nations surveyed. At least six-in-ten in each country say health care and education – two key issue areas that are highlighted by the SDGs – will be better for the next generation. And even though their views about the current state of the economy are negative, most are upbeat about the short-term economic future: Majorities in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya believe their countries’ economies will improve in the next 12 months. Moreover, roughly three-in-four Nigerians, Kenyans and South Africans believe that young people today who want to live a good life should stay in their countries rather than move abroad. These are among the key findings of a new Pew Research Center survey, conducted in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya among 3,330 respondents from March 29 to July 9, 2016. Pew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. This report was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which received support for the survey from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Sustainable Development Goals are wide-ranging, covering topics such as poverty, clean water and sanitation, and climate change. Among publics, however, there are clear priorities as to what they believe are most important for development. When South Africans, Nigerians and Kenyans are asked about the best example of an economically developed country, they tend to cite the U.S. and China. In Kenya, 36% say the U.S. is the best example, while 15% feel this way about China. South Africans are split between the two countries (27% U.S. vs. 22% China), as are Nigerians (25% vs. 28%). When asked what makes the U.S. or China the leading model for development, many respondents note the economic opportunities and growth in the two nations. Beyond this, however, people provide very different rationales for what makes the U.S. or China the best example. Respondents who name the U.S. tend to focus on American governance, citing good leadership and low levels of corruption, as well as education as reasons why the U.S. is economically successful. People who think China is the best example of an economically developed nation attribute this to Chinese technology, as well as their manufacturing and exports and their work ethic. South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya are complex societies, each with its own deep, long-standing cleavages that often divide public opinion. In South Africa, there are significant differences among the nation’s white, black, and mixed-race (known there as “coloured”) communities. On a number of questions in this survey, South African blacks are more optimistic than others about the future of the country. Roughly seven-in-ten blacks (69%) think the national economy will improve in the next 12 months, compared with 46% of white and 30% of mixed-race respondents, and they are also more likely to believe their own personal finances will improve in the coming year. South African blacks are more optimistic that the next generation will see improvements to such challenges as education, poverty, health care and corruption. And they are more likely than white or mixed-race South Africans to believe that young people should stay in South Africa to pursue a good life, rather than leave for another country. And while majorities of all three groups say the government is run for the benefit of only a few groups in society, whites and mixed-race respondents are more inclined than blacks to think so. Nigerian public opinion frequently divides along religious lines, with notable differences between Muslims and Christians. In our current poll, Muslims are much more upbeat about the economy, and more likely to believe that the national economy will improve in the next 12 months. Although majorities of both groups see inequality as a very big problem, Christians are especially likely to hold this view. And opinions about the fairness of government have shifted over the past year, perhaps reflecting a transition of power from former President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian, to current President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim. Among Nigeria’s Christians, 65% now say government is run for the benefit of a few groups, up slightly from 58% in 2015. Meanwhile, the share of Muslims expressing this view has dropped from 64% to 45%. Ethnic divisions are prominent on many issues in Kenya, with the Kikuyu and Kalenjin people expressing a much more positive outlook about the nation than the Luhya and Luo. Kikuyu and Kalenjin respondents are more satisfied with current economic conditions, and much less likely to say that the government is run for the benefit of only a few groups (current President Uhuru Kenyatta is Kikuyu, and all presidents since the country’s independence have been either Kikuyu or Kalenjin). Despite widespread concerns about political corruption, majorities in each of the three nations say that ordinary citizens can influence their government if they make the effort. And while concerns about government fairness divide these publics along racial, ethnic or religious lines, majorities of all groups believe their actions can make a difference. This belief among Kenyans, Nigerians and South Africans that they can impact their politicians is reflected in the publics’ reported level of participation in political activity. Broad majorities say they have voted in the past year or in the more distant past, on par with the percentage of Americans who report voting. Another form of traditional political activity, attending a political campaign event, is even more common in these three nations than in the U.S. Finally, while lack of internet access may limit somewhat the number of people who participate politically online, many in these three nations are particularly active in this way. (See “Even in Era of Disillusionment, Many Around the World Say Ordinary Citizens Can Influence the Government” for more on political participation around the world.) Education in South Africa. Following a year that has included a number of high-profile university-based protests of tuition fees, education is clearly a major issue for the South African public. The percentage naming poor-quality schools as a very big problem has increased 13 percentage points since 2015. And today, a 36% plurality names it as the nation’s top priority. However, there is considerable optimism that over the long term the country will make progress on this issue – two-thirds of South Africans believe education will be better for the next generation. Food shortages and energy in Nigeria. When Nigerians are asked about the top priorities for their country, the food supply and energy shortages are at the top of the list. Over the past year, there have been food shortages in northern Nigeria and fuel shortages across the country, and concerns about both of these issues have risen since our 2015 poll. Corruption in Kenya. Concern about government corruption is especially widespread in Kenya. The public is also the most likely to see a connection between governance and economic success. At least twice as many Kenyans as Nigerians or South Africans say good leadership and low levels of corruption help explain why a country is economically developed.","In the economic realm , most see rewards and opportunities going primarily to those at the top .

But it is also an important local news story, with many Americans depending on their local media outlets for information about the outbreak. In an April survey by Pew Research Center, conducted as part of the American News Pathways project, about six-in-ten Americans (61%) said they were following news about the coronavirus outbreak at both the national and local level equally. Around a quarter (23%) said they were paying more attention to news at the local level, while 15% said they were focused more on COVID-19 news at the national level. In the same survey, nearly half of U.S. adults (46%) named local news outlets as a major source for COVID-19 news – more than the share who named several other groups, including President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force (31%). Other local information sources were seen as important as well: For example, 36% of adults said state and local elected officials were a major source of news about the outbreak, while 16% said the same about friends, family and neighbors, and 8% named community newsletters or Listservs. In all, 64% of U.S. adults named at least one of these local information sources as a major source for coronavirus news. Americans also see local news outlets as more credible sources of COVID-19 information than the news media in general. In a survey conducted June 4-10, half of U.S. adults said their local news media get the facts right about the coronavirus outbreak almost all or most of the time, compared with 44% who said the same about the news media overall. Similarly, about half of Americans (53%) said their state and local governments get the facts right about COVID-19 all or most of the time. Black Americans are more likely than other adults to turn to local news organizations and to trust them to get the facts right about COVID-19. This aligns with two other, broader trends: Black Americans are more closely following COVID-19 news topics, and they are also more likely to be interested in local news and to trust information from local news organizations more generally. Despite the financial difficulties facing local newsrooms during the coronavirus outbreak, Americans do not perceive a dearth of local news about the pandemic, according to the Center’s June survey. Nearly two-thirds of adults (65%) said there is plenty of news about how the outbreak is affecting their local area, versus a third who said there is not enough of this kind of news.","In the same survey , nearly half of U.S. adults ( 46 % ) named local news outlets as a major source for COVID-19 news – more than the share who named several other groups , including President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force ( 31 % ) .

With this rapid growth in connectivity have come a host of potential problems, including fake news, political targeting and manipulation and financial scams, among others. Yet according to a new Pew Research Center analysis, most sub-Saharan Africans feel positively about the role the internet plays in their country. Large majorities say the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on education in their country, and half or more say the same about the economy, personal relationships and politics. Only when it comes to the issue of morality are sub-Saharan Africans somewhat more divided about the role the internet is playing. Across six major nations surveyed in the region, a median of 45% say the internet has had a positive impact on morality, while 39% say it is has been negative. These views vary substantially by country. For example, a majority of Nigerians (57%) believe the internet is having a good influence on morality, while more than half of Senegalese (54%) say the opposite. Still, in some countries, evaluations of how the internet affects morality have improved since 2014. In Ghana today, 42% think that growing internet use has a positive effect on morality – up from 29% in 2014. Favorable assessments of the internet’s impact on economics and politics have risen even more over the same time period. For example, in 2017, around two-thirds of Nigerians (64%) said the increasing use of the internet had a positive influence on their country’s politics, compared with just 43% in 2014. Generally, internet users –meaning people who say they use the internet or own an internet-connected smartphone – are more positive about its influence. For example, in all countries but Tanzania, internet users are more likely to think the internet plays a positive role in the country’s politics. In most countries, these gaps in attitudes between internet haves and have-nots persist whether looking at issues of morality, education, or even the economy. For instance, 72% of Ghanaian internet users see economic benefits stemming from greater connectivity, compared with 54% of non-users, and the pattern is the same in Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. These are among the major findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries from Feb. 21 to April 28, 2017, among 6,795 respondents. The survey also finds that sub-Saharan Africans primarily use the internet and their mobile phones for social and entertainment purposes, though many also use their mobile devices for sending and receiving payments. Still, people are more likely to engage in nearly all activities – even basic ones like texting – if they have smartphones, suggesting the emergence of a new digital divide based on phone type. The survey also highlights long-standing digital divides along demographic lines: Higher-income, more-educated and younger people are consistently more likely to use the internet, own a smartphone and engage in social networking. Globally, internet use is much more common in wealthier countries. The percentage of people who are online in each country is highly correlated with countries’ gross domestic product per capita (PPP). Regionally, internet use is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where a median of 41% across six countries use the internet. South Africa (59%) is the only country in the region where at least half the population is online. Still, the gap in internet use between emerging and advanced economies has narrowed. Whereas internet use in many of the world’s advanced economies has plateaued in recent years, use in sub-Saharan Africa has notably increased. In 2014, 15% of sub-Saharan Africans owned a smartphone, compared with 33% who own one today. The number of people connected to the internet is likely to continue to rise, too; industry projections suggest that the smartphone adoption rate in sub-Saharan Africa will double by 2025. As people across the region get online, new opportunities emerge to use the internet for education, for business or to communicate with their social networks. Sub-Saharan Africans are far-and-away most likely to use the internet for this last purpose: staying in touch with their family and friends. More than eight-in-ten internet users say they have used the internet for this purpose over the past year. While less common than keeping in touch with the people in their lives, around half of online sub-Saharan Africans use the internet to get news and information about politics (median of 53% of internet users) or public or government services (51%). Another four-in-ten use it to access information about health and medicine (41%). Comparatively few people have used the internet in the past year to look or apply for a job (26%) or to take an online class (14%). Even online shopping – a very common activity in the U.S. – remains somewhat limited in sub-Saharan Africa (17%). On social media, too, most people are gravitating toward social activities over political, religious or commercial ones. Among the minority of sub-Saharan Africans who use social media (ranging from 43% in South Africa to 20% in Tanzania), more say they share their views on entertainment-related topics like music, movies and sports than say they post about politics, religion or products they enjoy. Sub-Saharan Africans are more likely to use their mobile devices – whether smartphones or not – for social and entertainment purposes than for information-seeking or career- and commerce-related activities. Across the region, a majority of phone owners are using their devices to send text messages and to take pictures or video. Around four-in-ten phone owners also use their mobile phones to access social networking sites. Another very popular phone-based activity is making or receiving payments. Around six-in-ten mobile phone owners have used their devices for this type of online banking over the past year, ranging from a high of 83% in Kenya (where M-Pesa is a dominant force) to a low of 34% in Nigeria. Outside of banking, though, relatively few people use their phones for other career and commerce activities, like looking for or applying for jobs. Information-seeking activities are also less popular: Only around a third of mobile phone owners say they have used their mobile device over the past year to get news and information about politics, health or prices and products. Social activities and sending and receiving money are some of the most common mobile phone-based activities because they can be done both from a basic phone – one that does not connect to the internet – or from a smartphone. But even though they can be done at equal rates, people with smartphones are much more likely to use their phones for these types of activities. Take, for example, sending text messages. Those who have mobile devices that connect to the internet are much more likely to text their network than those with a basic phone. In Ghana, the difference is particularly stark: 79% of smartphone users have texted over the past year, compared with only a third of basic phone users. Similarly, while mobile phones are a very important tool for helping poorer people gain access to needed financial services, people are much more likely to use their phones to make or receive payments if they are internet-enabled. For example, in South Africa, more than half of those who have smartphones use their phones for mobile payments, whereas only a quarter of those with basic phones do the same. Smartphone users and basic phone users also differ in other key ways. People who are more educated, more affluent and younger are more likely to use smartphones than others. Smartphone users are also more likely to say the internet is having a positive impact on society. The interactive below provides data for levels of internet use, overall mobile phone ownership, smartphone ownership and social media use over time. All figures are based on total sample and include all data available for each year. You can sort the data by year or by country, and compare how the six sub-Saharan African countries highlighted in this report compare with other countries around the world.","Sub - Saharan Africa has experienced dramatic gains in internet use in recent years .

However, these bleak findings are put into some perspective by the fact that news organizations are more trusted sources of information than are many other institutions, including government and business. Further, people rate the performance of the news organizations they rely on much more positively than they rate the performance of news organizations generally. And the public’s impressions of the national media may be influenced more by their opinions of cable news outlets than their views of other news sources, such as network or local TV news, newspapers or internet news outlets. When asked what first comes to mind when they think of “news organizations,” most name a cable news outlet, with CNN and Fox News receiving the most mentions by far. The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press has been tracking views of press performance since 1985, and the overall ratings remain quite negative. Fully 66% say news stories often are inaccurate, 77% think that news organizations tend to favor one side, and 80% say news organizations are often influenced by powerful people and organizations. The widely-shared belief that news stories are inaccurate cuts to the press’s core mission: Just 25% say that in general news organizations get the facts straight while 66% say stories are often inaccurate. As recently as four years ago, 39% said news organizations mostly get the facts straight and 53% said stories are often inaccurate. But Americans have a very different view of the news sources they rely on than they do of the news media generally. When asked to rate the accuracy of stories from the sources where they get most of their news, the percentage saying these outlets get the facts straight more than doubles. Fully 62% say their main news sources get the facts straight, while just 30% say stories are often inaccurate. The biennial news attitudes survey was conducted July 20-24 among 1,501 adults nationwide, with supplemental data collected on other, smaller surveys in June, July and August. These surveys find that while the public holds news organizations in low regard, they are more trusted as a source of information than are federal, state and local governments, the Obama administration and business corporations. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say they have a lot or some trust in information they get from local news organizations, while 59% say they trust information from national news organizations. By comparison, about half say they have a lot or some trust in information provided by their state government (51%) and the Obama administration (50%). Smaller percentages trust information from federal agencies (44%), business corporations (41%), Congress (37%) or candidates running for office (29%). Overall, television continues to be the public’s main source for national and international news. Currently, 66% say they get most of their news from television, while 43% cite the internet as their main news source. While this is little changed from last year, over the long term the gap between TV and the internet has narrowed: Four years ago, roughly three times as many people cited TV than the internet as their main source of national and international news (74% vs. 24%). Despite the growth of internet news, it is clear that television news outlets, specifically cable news outlets, are central to people’s impressions of the news media. When asked what first comes to mind when they think of news organizations, 63% volunteer the name of a cable news outlet, with CNN and Fox News by far the most prevalent in people’s minds. Only about a third (36%) name one of the broadcast networks. Fewer than one-in-five mention local news outlets and only 5% mention a national newspaper such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal or USA Today. Just 3% name a website – either web-only or linked to a traditional news organization – when asked what comes to mind when they think of news organizations. The survey finds that the growth in negative attitudes toward the news media in recent years in several key areas has come among Democrats and independents. Since Barack Obama took office, the proportion of Democrats saying that news stories are often inaccurate has risen sharply, and they are now nearly as critical as Republicans. In 2007, 43% of Democrats and 56% of independents said stories were often inaccurate. Since then, the percentage of Democrats expressing skepticism about the accuracy of news reports has increased by 21 points to 64%, and the percentage of independents saying this has grown by 10 points. Republican views have held fairly steady: 69% see stories as often inaccurate, little changed from four years ago (63%). While the press’s overall reputation in many areas has declined, majorities continue to say that news organizations care about how good a job they do (62%) and are highly professional (57%). However, these evaluations also have slipped somewhat since 2007. The public also continues to view press criticism of political leaders as a check on possible wrongdoing. A majority (58%) says “such criticism is worth it because it keeps political leaders from doing things that should not be done.” Just a quarter (25%) say that press criticism of political leaders keeps them “from doing their job.” Partisan differences in views of the press’s watchdog role have disappeared in recent years. In 2007, during the Bush administration, 71% of Democrats and just 44% of Republicans said press criticism of political leaders was worth it because it kept them from doing things that should not be done. In 2009, after Obama took office, somewhat more Republicans (65%) than Democrats (55%) favored a watchdog role for the press. In the new survey, nearly identical percentages of Republicans (59%), Democrats (58%) and independents (58%) support the watchdog role. The survey finds that most Americans prefer news with no political point of view, and this feeling is particularly widespread when it comes to getting news online. Fully 74% of online news consumers say they prefer internet sources that do not have a political point of view. Just 19% prefer sources that have a political point of view. Social networking has expanded the ways in which the public gets news and information. About a quarter (27%) of adults say they regularly or sometimes get news or news headlines through Facebook, Twitter or other social networking sites. This rises to 38% of people younger than 30, but now spans a notable share of older Americans (12% of those 65 and older) as well. Most of those who get news from social networks (72%) say they mostly just get the same news and information they would get elsewhere. Just 27% say the news they get over social networking sites is different than the news they get elsewhere. And when asked to describe what they like about getting news over social networks and Twitter, answers range from features of the technology such as speed, portability and brevity to ways in which the content is more customized, personal and topical. While the public has long been critical of many aspects of the press’s performance, negative attitudes are at record levels in a number of areas. The percentage saying news organizations are often influenced by powerful people and organizations has reached an all-time high of 80%. Other measures, including the press’s perceived lack of fairness (77%), its unwillingness to admit mistakes (72%), inaccurate reporting (66%) and political bias (63%) match highs reached in 2009. The public is about evenly divided over whether news organizations are immoral (42%) or moral (38%), but the proportion saying the press is immoral also equals an all-time high. On the positive side, majorities continue to say that news organizations care about how good a job they do (62%) and are highly professional (57%). However, the percentage saying news organizations do not care about how good a job they do (31%) is at an all-time high, while the percentage saying they are not professional (32%) equals its previous high, reached in 1999. In the Pew Research Center’s first survey on news attitudes in 1985, majorities said that news organizations were often influenced by powerful people and organizations (53%) and tended to favor one side (53%). However, by a 55% to 34% margin, more Americans said that news organizations get the facts straight than said their stories were often inaccurate. Opinions of news organizations in all three areas have grown more negative since then. And since 2007, there have been increases in the percentages saying that news stories are often inaccurate (from 53% to 66%), that news organizations are often influenced by the powerful (from 69% to 80%), and that news organizations tend to favor one side (from 66% to 77%). A majority (57%) views news organizations as highly professional, while 32% say they are not professional. However, the percentage saying news organizations are not professional has risen 10 points since 2007. About six-in-ten (62%) say news organizations care about how good a job they do. However, just 18% think the media is willing to admit their mistakes; this is little changed from 2009 (21%). By two-to-one (62% to 31%), more Americans say that news organizations are politically biased than say they are careful to avoid biased reporting. These views have changed only modestly in recent years. During the mid-1980s, far fewer said news organizations were politically biased; in Pew Research’s first news attitudes survey, 45% said news organizations were politically biased while 36% said they were careful that their reporting was not politically biased. The news media also is faulted for invading people’s privacy and focusing too much attention on bad news, but these opinions have not become more negative over the past quarter century. In the current survey, 69% say news organizations invade people’s privacy, while 24% say they respect people’s privacy. In 1985, about as many (73%) said the press invaded people’s privacy. About two-thirds of Americans (66%) say news organizations pay too much attention to bad news, while 24% say news organizations report the kinds of stories they should be covering and just 3% say the media pay too much attention to good news. These opinions have varied little over the past decade. For the first time in a Pew Research Center survey, as many say that news organizations hurt democracy (42%) as protect democracy (42%). In the mid-1980s, about twice as many said that news organizations protect democracy rather than hurt democracy. The public also is divided over whether news organizations stand up for America (41%) or are too critical of America (39%). These opinions have changed little in recent years, but in 2002 and 2003 somewhat more said that news organizations stand up for America. Yet majorities have consistently expressed the view that criticism of political leaders by news organizations keeps them from doing things that should not be done. Today, 58% say this, while just 25% say that the news media’s criticism keeps political leaders from doing their jobs. Even as attitudes toward the press have grown more negative, support for the press’s watchdog role has remained stable. Over the past decade, Republicans have been more critical of the press’s performance than have independents or Democrats. But partisan differences in a number of areas have narrowed in recent years. Views of media accuracy and independence have become much more uniform across partisan groups, as Democrats and independents express increasingly critical views. Since 2007, the percentage of Democrats saying news organizations are often influenced by powerful people and organizations has grown by 12 points; there has been a comparable increase among independents (14 points). Meanwhile, Republicans’ views have shown less change. Even on issues where there continue to be substantial partisan differences, such as in views of political bias and whether the media is too critical of America, the gaps have narrowed. Three-quarters of Republicans (76%) say news organizations are politically biased, a view shared by 54% of Democrats. In 2007, 70% of Republicans but only 39% of Democrats said the press was politically biased. Views on this question among independents have changed little (63% now, 61% in 2007). Four years ago, Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to view the news media as too critical of America (63% vs. 23%). But in the current survey, far fewer Republicans (49%) say this, while the proportion of Democrats that see the press as too critical of America has grown eight points to 31%. Democrats (64%) and independents (66%) now are about as likely as Republicans (69%) to say news media produce inaccurate stories, a notable shift from just a few years ago, when Democrats and independents had more faith in media accuracy. Partisan gaps on these two issues had been as high as 21 points for inaccuracy and 17 points for influence, but the divides have narrowed to 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Despite their declining assessments of news media, Americans say they trust the information they get from news organizations more than they trust information they get from other places, including government and business sources. The public is most inclined to believe information from local news organizations: 69% say they trust such information a lot (17%) or some (52%). Almost six-in-ten (59%) say the same about national news organizations: 14% say they trust a lot of what they learn from the national media, while 45% say they have some trust in information provided by national news organizations. By comparison, Americans are about evenly divided over whether they trust information from the Obama administration: 50% say they trust it a lot or some, while 48% have not much or no trust in administration information. The public also is about evenly split over whether they trust information from their state governments (51% a lot or some, 47% not much or not at all). Fewer trust information from federal government agencies, business corporations or Congress. Just about three-in-ten trust a lot (1%) or some (28%) of what they learn from candidates running for office. There are no partisan differences in how much people trust national or local news organizations. About six-in-ten Republicans (62%), Democrats (60%) and independents (58%) say they trust a lot or some of the information they get from national news organizations. Figures are higher for local media: 75% of Republicans, 68% of Democrats and 69% of independents trust at least some of the information they get from local news outlets. However, among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, those who agree with the Tea Party movement express more skepticism about national media trustworthiness than do those who disagree or have no opinion of the Tea Party. Almost half of Tea Party supporters (47%) say they do not trust information from national news organizations much or at all, compared with only 31% of those who do not agree with the Tea Party or offer no opinion of it. There is no difference by Tea Party support when it comes to trust in local news organizations. Older Americans are notably less likely to trust information from national news media: 47% say they trust information from national news organizations a lot or some; about six-in-ten in all other age groups say the same. Despite their negative views about the press and the accuracy and fairness of its reports, most people say they are able to find news that is accurate. About six-in-ten (62%) say the news sources they use most generally get the facts straight; by comparison, just 25% say that news organizations generally get the facts straight. While the vast majority of people say the press, as a whole, tends to favor one side (77%), the public is divided over whether the sources they rely on most deal fairly with all sides or not. About half (49%) say the news sources they use most tend to favor one side, but about as many (45%) say their choice sources treat all sides fairly. There are only modest partisan differences in people’s views of the accuracy and independence of the news sources they use most. The public’s top two sources of news remain television and the internet. Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say television is where they get most of their news about national and international events, while 43% say they turn to the internet. About three-in-ten Americans (31%) say they get most of their national and international news from newspapers. Radio was a distant fourth choice, with 19% saying they turned to it for news. (People were allowed to name up to two sources). Television has dominated news consumption since the question was first asked in 1991, though the proportion naming it as a main source has declined over the past two decades. Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, about eight-in-ten named television as their main source of national and international news. The top sources of TV news are the Fox News Channel, cited by 19% of the public, CNN (15%), and local news programming (16%). Audiences for the Fox News Channel remain divided along partisan lines. About a third of Republicans (34%) cite Fox as their main source of national and international news, compared with 17% of independents and 9% of Democrats. This is little changed from 2009. Over the same period, the total audience for CNN, meanwhile, has declined from 22% of the public to 15%. Most of that decline has come among Democrats (down 10 points) and independents (down 6 points). Television also is the most frequently cited source of local news, with 59% citing it as a main source. Newspapers are cited more often as a source of local (39%) than national news (31%). By contrast, just 17% cite the internet as their top source of local news, less than half the percentage citing the internet as their main source of national and international news (43%). The internet is on par with radio (14%) as a local news source. There continue to be large age differences in the main sources for national news. Among those younger than 30, the internet far surpasses television as the main source for national and international news (65% vs. 51%). Television is the most frequently named source for older age groups, though the gap is fairly modest among those 30 to 49 (61% television vs. 51% internet). Those 65 and older are only age group in which more cite newspapers (49%) than the internet (15%) as a main national news source. The internet is cited about as often as newspapers by those 50 to 64 (36% internet, 33% newspapers), and far more often by younger people. Age differences are less pronounced in the leading sources of local news; majorities across all age groups cite television as their main source. Those under 50 are far more likely than older Americans to say they get local news from the internet, though only about quarter (23%) do so. Across all groups, newspapers are mentioned more often as a source for local than national news. The difference is particularly notable among those younger than 30 – 37% say they rely on newspapers for local news compared with 24% who cite newspapers as a main source for national and international news. When asked about the number of news sources available, 37% say the number of national news sources is growing while far fewer (13%) see the number of sources as shrinking; 47% say the number is staying the same. However, about as many say the number of local news sources is shrinking (21%) as growing (19%); 55% say the number is staying the same. Those younger than 30 are much more likely to say the number of national news sources is growing (47%) than are those 65 and older (29%). This may be related to young people’s greater reliance on the internet for national news. About half of internet news users (51%) say that when they last looked for news on a specific topic or story on the internet, they went first to a website that offers links to stories from many news organizations; 43% say they went directly to the website of one of their favorite news organizations. Among all internet users, search engine sites were the most popular place to look for news about a story or topic, with 21% citing Google and 14% citing Yahoo. CNN is the most popular news-organization website for searching, overall, offered by 13% of all internet news users. Among those whose last news searches took them first to a favorite news organization, CNN tops the list, with 22% citing it, followed by local news sites (13%). Yahoo and Fox also are popular options (10% each). Among those who went first to a site with links to other sites, Google was the most popular first destination, with more than a third naming it (35%), followed by Yahoo at 17%. More than six-in-ten Americans (63%) say they prefer news sources with no particular point of view, while 29% prefer sources that have a political point of view. The preference for news without a political point of view is even stronger when it comes to online news: 74% of those who get news online want it to come without a political point of view, while just 19% prefer online sources that have a point of view. About as many Democrats (35%) as Republicans (31%) say they want news with a political point of view; 24% of independents say this. The partisan differences are more pronounced for online news: 32% of Democrats prefer online news with a political point of view, but just 16% of Republicans and 14% of independents want the same. Even when the public has been asked whether they want news from their point of view, the clear preference is that the news have no particular point of view. In Pew Research’s 2010 media consumption survey, 62% said they wanted news with no particular point of view while just 25% wanted news from their point of view.","More than six - in - ten Americans ( 63 % ) say they prefer news sources with no particular point of view , while 29 % prefer sources that have a political point of view .

Public interest in the campaign was up somewhat from previous weeks with 27% of Americans paying very close attention to campaign news. More than one-in-five named the campaign as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week. This placed the campaign on par with the war in Iraq as one of the week’s two most closely followed stories. Democrats paid much closer attention to the campaign than Republicans: 36% of Democrats vs. 23% of Republicans followed campaign news very closely. Public interest in the Iraq war remained high despite relatively little news coverage More than three-in-ten Americans followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 20% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. Coverage of the Iraq policy debate has fallen off dramatically since September, and public interest in the debate continues to lag behind interest in the war itself. Last week 21% of the public paid very close attention to the debate in Washington over U.S. policy in Iraq; 5% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. The public’s interest in economic news remains moderate and has not grown in recent months. Roughly a quarter of the public (27%) paid very close attention to economic news last week and 16% listed this as the story they followed most closely. In other news last week, the public paid relatively little attention to tropical storm Noel (which was later upgraded to a hurricane). Just one-in-ten (11%) followed news about the storm very closely and 7% listed it as their most closely followed story of the week. Just 10% of the public paid very close attention to the nomination of Michael Mukasey to be the next attorney general — basically unchanged from September when George Bush announced Mukasey as his choice. Democrats paid closer attention than Republicans to this story. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage was collected from October 28 — November 2 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week was collected November 2-5 from a nationally representative sample of 1,009 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Sunday through Friday) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

Here’s our data roundup: 1 Only about 56% of students earn degrees within six years. The National Student Clearinghouse, a nonprofit verification and research organization, tracked 2.4 million first-time college students who enrolled in fall 2007 with the intent of pursuing a degree or certificate. The completion rate was highest (72.9%) among students who started at four-year, private, nonprofit schools, and lowest (39.9%) among those who started at two-year public institutions. 2 Business is still the most common major. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about a fifth (20.5%) of the 1.79 million bachelor’s degrees conferred in 2011-12 were in business. Business has been the single most common major since 1980-81; before that, education led the way. The least common bachelor’s degrees, according to the NCES, were in library science (95 conferred in 2011-12), military technologies and applied sciences (86) and precision production (37). 3 It’s harder for new graduates to find good jobs. It’s no secret that unemployment among recent grads remains higher than it was before the Great Recession. But in a recent report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York went deeper and looked at underemployment among recent grads (defined as people aged 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor’s degree). The Fed researchers used data from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine whether employed grads were in jobs that typically required a college degree, what those jobs paid, and whether they were working full- or part-time. They found that in 2012, about 44% of grads were working in jobs that didn’t require a college degree — a rate that, while about what it was in early 1990s, increased after the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions. Only 36% of that group were in what the researchers called “good non-college jobs” — those paying around $45,000 a year — down from around half in the 1990s. The share of underemployed recent grads in low-wage (below $25,000) jobs rose from about 15% in 1990 to more than 20%. About one-in-five (23%) underemployed recent grads were working part-time in 2011, up from 15% in 2000. 4 But graduates still out-earn people without degrees. A Pew Research Center report from earlier this year looked at earnings of Millennials (those born after 1980) who usually worked full-time in 2012. Among that group, workers with at least a bachelor’s degree had median annual earnings of $45,500, well over the medians for people with only some college ($30,000) or a high-school diploma ($28,000). The gap has widened over the years and across the generations: In 1965, when the members of the Silent Generation were 25 to 34 years old, median earnings for high-school graduates were 81% of those for college graduates; in 2013, among the Millennials, it was 61.5%. 5 Most grads think college was worth it. The same Pew Research report found that majorities of graduates in all three of the largest U.S. generations — Boomers, Gen-Xers and Millennials — agree that college either has paid off or will pay off, given what they and their families invested in it. Perhaps not surprisingly, the highest-earning graduates were the most positive about their educations — 98% of those making six figures and up said their degree had paid off, compared with 63% of graduates earning less than $50,000. Similarly, people with advanced degrees were even more likely than bachelor’s and associate’s degree holders to say their education was worth the investment — 96%, compared with 89% and 76%, respectively.","5 Most grads think college was worth it .

President Donald Trump was originally scheduled to attend the summit, but he has now decided to stay in Washington to address the ongoing crisis in Syria. Vice President Mike Pence will represent the United States in Trump’s place. Pence’s visit comes amid a drop in U.S. favorability across much of Latin America. In a 2017 Pew Research Center survey of seven Latin American countries, a median of 47% said they have a favorable view of the U.S. Approval was highest in the summit’s host country, Peru (51%), as well as in Colombia (51%) and Brazil (50%). The U.S. received the least positive ratings in Mexico, where just 30% said they have a favorable view. These numbers mark a considerable decline since the last Summit of the Americas in 2015. At that time, public opinion of the U.S. in the region was largely favorable: Across the same seven countries, a median of 66% had a favorable view of the U.S., 19 percentage points higher than in last year’s survey. The decline in favorable opinions of the U.S. across the region was most pronounced in Mexico: About two-thirds of Mexicans (66%) approved of the U.S. in 2015, but that share had fallen 36 points by 2017. As is the case in much of the world, relatively few people in Latin America express confidence in Trump’s leadership on the global stage. A median of 77% in Latin America said in the 2017 survey that they have no confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs. In 2014, just 42% of people in the same seven countries said they had no confidence in then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Among 37 countries surveyed globally in 2017, Trump received his lowest ratings on this question in Mexico, where 93% said they have no confidence in the U.S. leader. His proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border was also particularly unpopular in the United States’ southern neighbor, where 94% said they disapproved of the project. The border wall was similarly unpopular across the other six Latin American countries surveyed, with a regional median of 83% saying they opposed it. Majorities in Latin America also opposed other possible Trump administration policies, including restrictions on people traveling from majority-Muslim countries to the U.S., and U.S. withdrawal from major international trade and climate change agreements. Large majorities of people in Latin America also had negative views of Trump’s personal characteristics, describing him as arrogant (a median of 82%), intolerant (77%) and dangerous (66%). However, about three-quarters (77%) also described the president as a strong leader. The theme for this year’s Summit of the Americas is “Democratic Governance Against Corruption,” with additional focus on corruption’s impact on development and social inequality in the participating countries. The theme is particularly timely for the host country, which saw its president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, abruptly resign in March after being accused of accepting illegal payments from a Brazilian construction conglomerate. Kuczynski’s vice president, Martin Vizcarra, was subsequently sworn in as president, and he will represent Peru at the summit. In 2017, a majority of Peruvians (73%) reported being dissatisfied with the way democracy was going in their country, and just 12% said they trusted their national government to do what is right for their country. Discontent with democracy is rife throughout Latin America, where a regional median of 73% said they were dissatisfied with how democracy is working in their countries. A majority of Peruvians (60%) also do not feel close to any of their country’s political parties. The share of people who are not affiliated with any political party is high across Latin America: Half or more in Chile (78%), Brazil (60%), Argentina (51%) and Colombia (50%) say they do not feel close to any political party in their country.","Among 37 countries surveyed globally in 2017 , Trump received his lowest ratings on this question in Mexico , where 93 % said they have no confidence in the U.S. leader .

Last October, 57% approved and 33% disapproved. The possibility of sending U.S. ground troops to the region is more divisive, although the idea draws more support than it did four months ago. Currently, about as many favor (47%) as oppose (49%) sending U.S. ground troops to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria; in October, 39% favored the idea and 55% opposed it. The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 18-22 among 1,504 adults, also finds a shift over the past year in public attitudes about the best approach for dealing with global terrorism. In the new survey, 47% say “using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world.” About as many (46%) say that “relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism.” In the Pew Research Center’s political typology survey, conducted Jan. 23-Mar. 16, 2014, 57% said an over-reliance on military force creates more hatred leading to increased terrorism, while fewer (37%) said that overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat global terrorism. There is a wide and growing partisan divide in these attitudes: Today, 74% of Republicans say the best way to defeat global terrorism is with “overwhelming force,” up from 57% a year ago. Meanwhile, Democrats’ attitudes are virtually unchanged. Just 30% of Democrats favor the use of overwhelming force to defeat terrorism; 29% said this last March. While the public has grown more supportive of assertive action against ISIS, many Americans continue to express trepidation about the U.S. becoming too deeply involved in Iraq and Syria. While 49% say their bigger worry about U.S. military action is that it will not go far enough in stopping Islamic militants, nearly as many (46%) say their bigger concern is that the U.S. will go too far in getting involved in the situation. That has changed only modestly since October, although the share voicing more concern about not going far enough to defeat the militants has risen six points (from 43% to 49%). The partisan differences evident in overall attitudes about the best way to defeat terrorism are reflected in concerns about the ISIS campaign and opinions about whether to dispatch U.S. ground forces to Iraq and Syria. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to favor the use of ground troops to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria (67% vs. 32%). By contrast, more than three times as many Democrats as Republicans say their bigger concern about U.S. military action is that the United States will go too far in getting involved in the  (64% vs. 20%). Meanwhile, the public continues to express skepticism about the effectiveness of the U.S. campaign against ISIS. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) say the military campaign against Islamic militants is going not too well (38%) or not at all well (20%); just 36% think it is going very well (7%) or fairly well (30%). Views about progress of the military campaign are unchanged  October. However, most Americans (60%) think the U.S. effort against ISIS will definitely or probably succeed. A 45% plurality say the U.S. and its allies will probably succeed against the Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, while 15% think they will definitely succeed. About one-third (34%) thinks the campaign will probably fail (28%) or definitely fail (5%). Similar shares of Democrats (62%) and Republicans (61%) expect the to be a success. The survey also finds that the current U.S. government policy of banning the payment of ransom money for hostages held by terrorist groups has widespread approval. Though the policy has come under some recent criticism, 70% approve of the current U.S. government policy while just 25% disapprove. Young adults are among the least supportive groups of the policy of not paying money for hostages, though 58% still approve (vs. 38% who disapprove). Among other age groups, about seven-in-ten or more approve of this policy. About eight-in-ten Republicans (78%) approve of the government’s no-ransom policy, compared with 68% of Democrats and 69% of independents. The share of the public approving of the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and Syria has risen since October, from 57% to 63%. As was the case in October, more Republicans (70%) than Democrats (58%) approve of the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. There also continues to be a gender gap in support for military action: 70% of men approve of the campaign against ISIS, compared with 56% of women. Support for the possible use of ground forces also has risen since October, from 39% to 47%. The share of women favoring the U.S. sending ground troops has jumped 11 points since then (compared with a slight five-point increase among men); still, women remain less likely than men to favor deploying U.S. ground forces in Iraq and Syria (41% vs. 52%). Today, adults 18-29 are the only age group to largely oppose sending troops to the region (59% oppose vs. 39% favor). Older age groups have become somewhat more supportive since October and now are roughly divided between favoring and opposing the possible deployment of ground forces. Both parties are ideologically divided over the dispatch of U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria. About seven-in-ten conservative Republicans (71%) favor the use of ground troops compared with 56% of moderate and liberal Republicans. Among Democrats, conservatives and moderates are more likely than liberals to favor the use of ground forces (39% vs. 23%). In October, nearly identical percentages of the two groups supported deploying ground forces (28% of conservative and moderate Democrats, 27% of liberal Democrats). Since then, the share of conservative and moderate Democrats favoring the use of U.S. ground forces has increased 11 points while remaining relatively unchanged among liberals. The public remains divided in its concerns about U.S. military action in Iraq and Syria: 49% say their bigger concern is that military action will not go far enough to stop the Islamic militants; 46% say they are more concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Iraq and Syria. That mixed sentiment has not shifted significantly since last October. But in August, when the U.S. started limited airstrikes in Iraq, more said they were concerned about the military action getting the U.S. too involved (51%) than not going far enough (32%). Today, about three-quarters of Republicans (77%) are more concerned that the military action won’t go far enough (20% say their bigger concern is that the U.S. will go too far). By contrast, 64% of Democrats say the bigger worry is that the U.S. will go too far in getting involved and 30% are more concerned about not going far enough. Independents are split, with 47% expressing each concern. Adults younger than 30 are the most likely to worry that the military campaign will go too far (64%) rather than not far enough (33%). Those ages 30-49 are divided, while a majority of adults 50 and older say they are more concerned that the U.S. will not go far enough to stop the Islamic militants (58% to 35%). Among those who are more concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Iraq and Syria, opinion is divided about the current military campaign — 48% approve and 44% disapprove. Support for the military campaign is much higher among those whose bigger worry is that the U.S. will not go far enough to stop the militants (78% approve, 19% disapprove). Americans are divided about how to best defeat global terrorism — a shift from past years. Nearly half (47%) say that using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat global terrorism; 46% say that relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism. In previous Pew Research surveys in 2014, 2011 and 2004, no more than about four-in-ten (including 37% early last year) said the use of overwhelming force was the best approach for defeating global terrorism. Republicans and independents have shifted their opinions since last year, while Democrats’ views are largely unchanged. Roughly three-quarters of Republicans (74%) express the view that overwhelming force is the best way to defeat terrorism, up 17 points since early last year; 44% of independents say the same, up 11 points. Just three-in-ten Democrats (30%) say the best way to stop global terrorism is with overwhelming force, compared with 65% who say relying too much on force leads to more terrorism. Liberal Democrats are more likely than conservative or moderate Democrats to say using overwhelming military force against terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism (80% vs. 58%). Adults 50 and older are more likely to believe overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism (56% vs. 35% saying too much force creates more terrorism). By comparison, 45% of those ages 30-49 and just 32% of adults under 30 say overwhelming force is the best way to defeat terrorism.","The public has grown more supportive of the U.S. fight against ISIS , as about twice as many approve ( 63 % ) as disapprove ( 30 % ) of the military campaign against the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria .

General Assembly has frequently produced controversy. In a 2006 speech to the Assembly, for example, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez famously referred to then President George W. Bush as “the devil.” For his part, Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has used his turns at the podium to speak strongly against Israel and the United States. But controversies aside, the United Nations remains a quite popular institution throughout much of the world. Indeed, its image has improved in many nations over the last couple of years. This is especially true in the United States, where attitudes toward the U.N. are more positive than they have been since early in this decade. A 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey, conducted in May and June of this year, found largely positive views toward the U.N. with majorities or pluralities in 19 of the 25 countries expressing a positive opinion. Moreover, ratings of the U.N. have grown more positive since 2007 in 12 of the 25 nations. Europeans overwhelmingly give the U.N. favorable reviews. More than seven-in-ten in France (74%) and Poland (72%) offer a favorable opinion, as do majorities in Britain (67%), Germany (65%), Spain (61%) and Russia (56%). The organization is also widely popular in the two African countries surveyed, Kenya (76% favorable) and Nigeria (71%), and to a lesser extent in two of the three Latin American nations included, Mexico (58%) and Brazil (52%). In Argentina, however, nearly half (45%) offer no opinion. Many in Pakistan (42%) and India (27%) are also unable to give an opinion. Elsewhere in Asia, ratings are on balance positive, especially in South Korea and Indonesia both of which countries accord the U.N. a 79%-favorable rating, its highest marks on the survey. In the Middle East, views are mixed. Most Lebanese give the organization positive ratings, although, as with many issues in Lebanon, opinions are sharply divided along religious lines, with 86% of Sunnis and 73% of Christians giving the U.N. a favorable rating, compared with only 19% of Shia Muslims. Most Egyptians (56%) express a positive opinion. However, views in Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories tend to be negative. Positive ratings for the U.N. have become much more common since 2007 in both Egypt (+12 percentage points) and Jordan (+12 percentage points). In no country, however, have ratings improved as much as in the United States. Two years ago, 48% of Americans held a favorable view of the U.N., compared with 61% today, the highest U.S. rating the U.N. has received since 2001, when a Pew Research Center for the People & the Press survey found that 77% of Americans held a positive view of the organization. The partisan differences that have characterized American public opinion on this topic for the last few years remain, although the U.N.’s image has improved across party lines. Democrats continue to be the most positive, with 73% expressing a favorable view, compared with six-in-ten independents and about half of Republicans (49%). There is also an age gap on this question. Fully 70% of 18-29 year-olds have a positive view, up from 56% two years ago. More than six-in-ten (65%) of those ages 30-49 have a favorable opinion, up steeply from 46% in 2007. Older Americans are more lukewarm – 54% have a positive impression of the U.N., a modest seven-percentage-point rise since 2007. In the U.S., ratings for the U.N. are also linked to ratings for some other key players in the international arena. Americans who have positive opinions of China and Russia also tend to give the U.N. good reviews, while those with unfavorable opinions of these major powers also tend to see the international body in a negative light. For example, 81% of those expressing a favorable view of China also have a favorable view of the U.N., compared with just 44% among those expressing a negative opinion about China. Elsewhere in the world, a similar pattern often holds — those who hold positive views about the major powers in the international system also tend to assign positive ratings to the world’s leading international institution. For instance, attitudes toward the U.N. are often linked to attitudes about the world’s most powerful nation, the United States. Overall, across the 24 nations (other than the U.S.) included in the Pew Global Attitudes poll, ratings for the U.N. and the U.S. are correlated at the .72 level, suggesting a close relationship between perceptions of the U.N. and its host country.","Europeans overwhelmingly give the U.N. favorable reviews .

With this rapid growth in connectivity have come a host of potential problems, including fake news, political targeting and manipulation and financial scams, among others. Yet according to a new Pew Research Center analysis, most sub-Saharan Africans feel positively about the role the internet plays in their country. Large majorities say the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on education in their country, and half or more say the same about the economy, personal relationships and politics. Only when it comes to the issue of morality are sub-Saharan Africans somewhat more divided about the role the internet is playing. Across six major nations surveyed in the region, a median of 45% say the internet has had a positive impact on morality, while 39% say it is has been negative. These views vary substantially by country. For example, a majority of Nigerians (57%) believe the internet is having a good influence on morality, while more than half of Senegalese (54%) say the opposite. Still, in some countries, evaluations of how the internet affects morality have improved since 2014. In Ghana today, 42% think that growing internet use has a positive effect on morality – up from 29% in 2014. Favorable assessments of the internet’s impact on economics and politics have risen even more over the same time period. For example, in 2017, around two-thirds of Nigerians (64%) said the increasing use of the internet had a positive influence on their country’s politics, compared with just 43% in 2014. Generally, internet users –meaning people who say they use the internet or own an internet-connected smartphone – are more positive about its influence. For example, in all countries but Tanzania, internet users are more likely to think the internet plays a positive role in the country’s politics. In most countries, these gaps in attitudes between internet haves and have-nots persist whether looking at issues of morality, education, or even the economy. For instance, 72% of Ghanaian internet users see economic benefits stemming from greater connectivity, compared with 54% of non-users, and the pattern is the same in Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. These are among the major findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries from Feb. 21 to April 28, 2017, among 6,795 respondents. The survey also finds that sub-Saharan Africans primarily use the internet and their mobile phones for social and entertainment purposes, though many also use their mobile devices for sending and receiving payments. Still, people are more likely to engage in nearly all activities – even basic ones like texting – if they have smartphones, suggesting the emergence of a new digital divide based on phone type. The survey also highlights long-standing digital divides along demographic lines: Higher-income, more-educated and younger people are consistently more likely to use the internet, own a smartphone and engage in social networking. Globally, internet use is much more common in wealthier countries. The percentage of people who are online in each country is highly correlated with countries’ gross domestic product per capita (PPP). Regionally, internet use is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where a median of 41% across six countries use the internet. South Africa (59%) is the only country in the region where at least half the population is online. Still, the gap in internet use between emerging and advanced economies has narrowed. Whereas internet use in many of the world’s advanced economies has plateaued in recent years, use in sub-Saharan Africa has notably increased. In 2014, 15% of sub-Saharan Africans owned a smartphone, compared with 33% who own one today. The number of people connected to the internet is likely to continue to rise, too; industry projections suggest that the smartphone adoption rate in sub-Saharan Africa will double by 2025. As people across the region get online, new opportunities emerge to use the internet for education, for business or to communicate with their social networks. Sub-Saharan Africans are far-and-away most likely to use the internet for this last purpose: staying in touch with their family and friends. More than eight-in-ten internet users say they have used the internet for this purpose over the past year. While less common than keeping in touch with the people in their lives, around half of online sub-Saharan Africans use the internet to get news and information about politics (median of 53% of internet users) or public or government services (51%). Another four-in-ten use it to access information about health and medicine (41%). Comparatively few people have used the internet in the past year to look or apply for a job (26%) or to take an online class (14%). Even online shopping – a very common activity in the U.S. – remains somewhat limited in sub-Saharan Africa (17%). On social media, too, most people are gravitating toward social activities over political, religious or commercial ones. Among the minority of sub-Saharan Africans who use social media (ranging from 43% in South Africa to 20% in Tanzania), more say they share their views on entertainment-related topics like music, movies and sports than say they post about politics, religion or products they enjoy. Sub-Saharan Africans are more likely to use their mobile devices – whether smartphones or not – for social and entertainment purposes than for information-seeking or career- and commerce-related activities. Across the region, a majority of phone owners are using their devices to send text messages and to take pictures or video. Around four-in-ten phone owners also use their mobile phones to access social networking sites. Another very popular phone-based activity is making or receiving payments. Around six-in-ten mobile phone owners have used their devices for this type of online banking over the past year, ranging from a high of 83% in Kenya (where M-Pesa is a dominant force) to a low of 34% in Nigeria. Outside of banking, though, relatively few people use their phones for other career and commerce activities, like looking for or applying for jobs. Information-seeking activities are also less popular: Only around a third of mobile phone owners say they have used their mobile device over the past year to get news and information about politics, health or prices and products. Social activities and sending and receiving money are some of the most common mobile phone-based activities because they can be done both from a basic phone – one that does not connect to the internet – or from a smartphone. But even though they can be done at equal rates, people with smartphones are much more likely to use their phones for these types of activities. Take, for example, sending text messages. Those who have mobile devices that connect to the internet are much more likely to text their network than those with a basic phone. In Ghana, the difference is particularly stark: 79% of smartphone users have texted over the past year, compared with only a third of basic phone users. Similarly, while mobile phones are a very important tool for helping poorer people gain access to needed financial services, people are much more likely to use their phones to make or receive payments if they are internet-enabled. For example, in South Africa, more than half of those who have smartphones use their phones for mobile payments, whereas only a quarter of those with basic phones do the same. Smartphone users and basic phone users also differ in other key ways. People who are more educated, more affluent and younger are more likely to use smartphones than others. Smartphone users are also more likely to say the internet is having a positive impact on society. The interactive below provides data for levels of internet use, overall mobile phone ownership, smartphone ownership and social media use over time. All figures are based on total sample and include all data available for each year. You can sort the data by year or by country, and compare how the six sub-Saharan African countries highlighted in this report compare with other countries around the world.","On social media , too , most people are gravitating toward social activities over political , religious or commercial ones .

The public expresses mixed views of the impact of the long-term decline in union membership on the country: 45% say this has been mostly a bad thing, while 43% see it as mostly a good thing. However, the effects of the decline in union membership on working people is seen in more negative terms: 52% say the reduction in union representation has been mostly bad for working people, compared with fewer (40%) who say it has been mostly good. The balance of opinion on this question is about the same as it was in a 1994 NBC/Wall Street Journal survey that asked about the previous 20 years. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted March 25-29 among 1,500 adults, finds little recent change in overall favorability of labor unions: 48% hold a favorable view of unions, while somewhat fewer (39%) say they have an unfavorable view. Opinions of unions have recovered from lows reached in 2010 and 2011. Public views of business corporations have followed a similar trajectory. Currently, 48% have a favorable impression of business corporations, compared with 43% who have an unfavorable opinion. While the public expresses mixed views of unions overall, majorities of Americans say many different types of employees in specific sectors should be able to unionize. Among the six sectors tested in the survey, support for workers’ ability to form a union is highest for factory and manufacturing workers: 82% say these workers should be able to unionize, while just 15% say they should not be able Support for the ability of employees to unionize spans both public and private sectors: Seven-in-ten or more say public transportation workers (74%), police and firefighters (72%), and public school teachers (71%) should be able to unionize. For private sector workers in supermarkets and retail sales, a comparable 68% say these workers should be able to unionize. A somewhat smaller majority (62%) says fast-food workers should be able to unionize, while 35% say they should not be able to. Fast-food restaurants have been the subject of recent protests around the country in support of higher wages. The percentage saying fast-food workers should be able to unionize is the lowest of the six types of employees included in the survey. There are sharp partisan differences in views of labor unions, including in opinions about workers being able to unionize. Among Democrats, support for the ability to form a union ranges from 77% for fast-food workers to 92% for manufacturing and factory workers. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say each group of employees should be able to form a union. Still, a large majority of Republicans (71%) say factory and manufacturing workers should be able to unionize, and more than half say police and firefighters (59%), public transportation workers (58%) and public school teachers (54%) should be able to unionize. However, just 42% of Republicans favor allowing fast-food workers to form unions; 54% say they should not able to unionize. Majorities of Democrats say the decline in union representation over the past two decades is mostly bad for the country (59%) and for working people (62%). Republicans, by about two-to-one (62% to 29%), say the long-term reduction in union representation has been mostly good for the country. Republicans have more mixed views of the decline’s impact on working people: about half (51%) say the reduction in union representation has been mostly good for workers, compared with 39% who say it has been mostly bad. Across demographic groups, there are wide differences in overall favorability ratings of labor unions. Among blacks, who are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to be union members, 60% hold a favorable view of unions; by comparison, 49% of Hispanics and 45% of whites view unions favorably. Across age groups, views of unions are most positive among young adults: 55% of those ages 18-29 view unions favorably, while just 29% view them unfavorably. Among older adults, favorability ratings of unions are mixed with about as many holding favorable as unfavorable views. Favorable views of unions are higher among lower-income households earning less than $30,000 a year (54%), than among those earning $30,000-$74,999 (44%) or $75,000 or more (45%). By region, those living in the South are less likely than those living elsewhere in the country to hold favorable views of unions: 41% of Southerners view labor unions favorably, while 42% hold an unfavorable view. In the three other regions of the country, more hold favorable than unfavorable views of unions. In households with at least one current union member, 64% view labor unions favorably, compared with 34% who hold unfavorable views. In households with former – but no current –union members, views of labor unions are not much different than the public overall (49% favorable, 42% unfavorable). By about two-to-one (65%-23%) more Democrats view unions favorably than unfavorably. By contrast, Republicans view unions unfavorably by a comparably wide 60%-28% margin. Conservative Republicans are especially likely to hold unfavorable views of unions (66%), compared with 50% of moderate and liberal Republicans. While Republicans hold much more negative views of labor unions than Democrats and independents, there also are differences in views of unions within the GOP. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ages 18-34, about as many say they have a favorable (45%) as unfavorable (44%) view of labor unions. By contrast, older Republicans are much more negative. For example, two-thirds (66%) of Republicans age 50 and older have an unfavorable view of unions, while just 24% hold a favorable view. Republicans and Republican leaners with no more than a high school education are about twice as likely as those with a college degree to view unions favorably (41% vs. 19%). A similar pattern is seen among Republicans across incomes levels, with those earning less expressing mixed views and higher earners holding unfavorable views of unions. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, there are only modest differences in views of unions. There are no significant differences among Democrats by age; across education and income, Democrats with higher levels express the most favorable views of unions, but majorities of those with lower incomes and less education also view unions favorably. Overall favorability ratings for business corporations are very similar to those of labor unions: 48% hold a favorable view of business corporations, compared with 43% who hold an unfavorable view. Ratings of business corporations have tracked closely with those of labor unions in recent years. As with unions, ratings of business corporations have recovered from lows reached in 2011, but remain well below previous highs in favorability. Overall, Republicans express positive views of business corporations: 60% view them favorably, compared with just 31% who view them unfavorably. Conservative Republicans (67% favorable, 24% unfavorable) are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans (50% favorable, 41% unfavorable) to take a positive view of business corporations. Among Democrats, ratings of business corporations are mixed: 51% hold an unfavorable view, while 44% view them favorably. There are differences in views between liberal and moderate and conservative Democrats. By a 62%-35% margin, most liberal Democrats hold an unfavorable view of business corporations. Conservative and moderate Democrats, by contrast, are about as likely to hold favorable (50%) as unfavorable (44%) views of business corporations. Across income levels, those with family incomes of $75,000 a year or more view business corporations favorably by a 57%-39% margin. Views are less positive among those earning less than $75,000, with about as many rating business corporations favorably as unfavorably.","Overall favorability ratings for business corporations are very similar to those of labor unions : 48 % hold a favorable view of business corporations , compared with 43 % who hold an unfavorable view .","What are the public opinions about business corporations?","48 % hold a favorable view of business corporations , compared with 43 % who hold an unfavorable view .","48 % hold a favorable view of business corporations , compared with 43 % who hold an unfavorable view ."],"5839":["5839.png","Weighting corrects for oversampling weighting ofpoll respondents 25%","Every election year, questions arise about how polling techniques and practices might skew poll results one way or the other. In the final weeks before this year’s election, the practice of “oversampling” and its possible effect on presidential polls is in the media spotlight. Oversampling is the practice of selecting respondents so that some groups make up a larger share of the survey sample than they do in the population. Oversampling small groups can be difficult and costly, but it allows polls to shed light on groups that would otherwise be too small to report on. This might sound like it would make the survey unrepresentative, but pollsters correct this through weighting. With weighting, groups that were oversampled are brought back in line with their actual share of the population – removing the potential for bias. When people think about opinion polls, they might envision taking a random sample of all adults in the U.S. where everybody has the same chance of being selected. When selected this way, the sample on average will look just like the full population in terms of the share that belongs to different groups. For example, the percentage of men and women or the share of younger and older people should fall close to their true share of the population. For the telephone surveys that Pew Research Center conducts, the process is a little more complicated (in order to account for things like cellphones and the fact that not everyone responds to surveys), but usually we want all adults to have an equal chance of being selected into the sample. This works very well if you are interested in the overall population, but often we want to know what different kinds of people think about issues and how they compare with one another. When we are interested in learning about groups that make up only a small share of the population, the usual approach can leave us with too few people in each group to produce reliable estimates. When we want to look closely at small groups, we have to design the sample differently so that we have enough respondents in each group to analyze. We do this by giving members of the small group a higher chance of being selected than everybody else. A good example is a Pew Research Center survey from June of this year, in which we wanted to focus in depth on the U.S. Hispanic population. In the previous survey from March, there were 291 Hispanic respondents out of 2,254 total respondents, or 13% of the sample before weighting. This is pretty close to the true Hispanic share of the population (15%), but we wanted to have more than 291 people responding so we could do a more in-depth analysis. In order to have a larger sample of Hispanics in June, we surveyed 543 Hispanics out of 2,245 total respondents, or 24% of the unweighted sample. This gave us a much larger sample to analyze, and made the estimates for Hispanics more precise. If we just stopped here, estimates for the total population would overrepresent Hispanics. Instead, we weight them back down so that when we look at the whole sample, the share of Hispanics falls back in line with their actual share of the population. This way, we still have more precise estimates when looking at Hispanics specifically, but we also have the correct distribution when looking at the sample as a whole. Pew Research Center’s 2014 Religious Landscape Survey also used oversampling in states like Wyoming so that researchers could make reliable estimates about Wyomingites’ religious beliefs and practices. Thanks to oversampling, we interviewed 316 Wyoming residents, instead of an estimated 63 under a non-oversampling design. The survey weighting adjusted for this by aligning the 0.9% of respondents from Wyoming with their actual share of share of the U.S. population (0.2%).","A good example is a Pew Research Center survey from June of this year , in which we wanted to focus in depth on the U.S. Hispanic population .

Cruz responded in Spanish with a challenge to Rubio to discuss their views on immigration in that language. Rubio’s confrontation with Cruz, who recently became the first Hispanic to win the Iowa caucuses, was interpreted by some as a challenge to how much Cruz belongs to or identifies with the Hispanic community in the U.S. (It’s worth noting that this is not a new tactic. Hispanic Democrats have been confronted before by fellow Latinos in a similar way.) But what does the Hispanic public think when it comes to the question of whether it is necessary to speak Spanish in order to be considered Hispanic? On the one hand, Spanish is an important part of Latino culture and identity, with 95% of Latinos saying it is important for future generations to speak Spanish. At the same time, most Latino adults say it is not necessary to speak Spanish to be considered Latino. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey of Latinos, 71% of Latino adults hold that view while 28% say the opposite. Among Hispanics, views on speaking Spanish and Hispanic identity differ, though majorities of all key subgroups say speaking Spanish isn’t necessary to be considered Hispanic. For example, 58% of immigrant Hispanics say speaking Spanish isn’t a necessary component of Latino identity, as do 87% of U.S.-born Hispanics. The 2015 survey of Latino adults also shows that among Hispanic registered voters, 81% say speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Hispanic. While language use differs among Hispanics – some speak only English, some speak only Spanish and some are bilingual – Spanish is still a characteristic that, for the most part, unites much of group. About three-quarters of Latinos, no matter where they are from, speak Spanish at home. Even so, the share that does so at home is declining at the same time that immigration from Mexico has slowed substantially and U.S. births have become the driver of Hispanic population growth. In fact, the share of Latinos who speak only English at home is rising. Today, 27% of Hispanics ages 5 and older live in a household where only English is spoken, compared with 22% in 2006. Methodology: The data for this post on the relationship between speaking Spanish and Hispanic identity are drawn from our 2015 National Survey of Latinos, a nationally representative, bilingual survey of 1,500 Latino adults. It was conducted on cellular and landline telephones from Oct. 21 through Nov. 30, 2015. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.","At the same time , most Latino adults say it is not necessary to speak Spanish to be considered Latino .

This stands in stark contrast to expectations prior to the first presidential debate two weeks ago, which voters expected Obama to win by a 51%-29% margin. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Oct. 12-14, 2012, among 1,006 adults, including 857 registered voters, finds debate expectations for Romney have improved sharply among independents: Two weeks ago more independents thought Obama would win the first debate by a 44% to 28% margin. Today, more independents expect Romney to win the second debate, by a 42% to 31% margin. Expectations for Romney are also up among Republicans (from 64% expecting him to do better than Obama in the first debate to 75% now). Few Democrats (9%) think Romney will do the better job in tomorrow’s debate, but they are less uniformly certain about how Obama will do. Two weeks ago, fully 89% of Democratic voters said they expected Obama to do the better job. That has slipped to 75% of Democrats going into the second debate, as the percentage who do not choose either candidate has about doubled (from 7% to 16%). Despite controversy over massive spending by outside groups in the 2012 race, relatively few voters think either candidate has been too personally critical of his opponent. Just 37% say that Romney has been too personally critical of Obama while a comparable percentage (35%) says Obama has been too personally critical of Romney. In June, more thought Romney was being too critical of Obama (43%) than thought Obama was being too critical of Romney (30%). Independents, in particular, have become less likely to say Romney has been too critical of Obama: Just 31% say this in the current survey, down from 42% in June. In October 2008, nearly half of voters (48%) said John McCain was too personally critical of Obama. And over five recent presidential election cycles, no Republican candidate has been viewed as less personally critical of their opponent than Romney is today. More voters say Obama is being too critical of Romney (35%) than said that about Obama’s campaign against McCain in 2008 (22%). In 2004, 52% of voters said John Kerry was being too critical of his opponent. In 1996, very few voters (21%) said Bill Clinton was too personally critical of Bob Dole in his re-election campaign. Six-in-ten voters say they watched at least a little of last Thursday night’s vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan at Centre College in Danville, KY. Among debate watchers, as many say Biden did the better job (47%) as say Ryan (46%). Before the debate, voters were similarly divided as to who they thought would do the better job with about as many saying Ryan (40%) as Biden (34%). For more see: “Biden Viewed Unfavorably, Divided Opinions about Ryan,” released Oct. 10, 2012. Republican voters overwhelmingly say Ryan did the better job in the debate (88%); a comparable percentage of Democrats (89%) say Biden did the better job.

But other attitudes relating to terrorism and security, as well as perceptions of whether Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence, have shown far less change. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Dec. 8-13 among 1,500 adults, finds that since the start of this year, the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points – from 72% to 46% – and now stands at its lowest point in the post-9/11 era. Approval of the way Barack Obama is handling the threat of terrorism also has declined, even as his overall job rating (currently 46%) – and his ratings on immigration, the economy and other issues – is little changed. Just 37% approve of the way Obama is handling terrorism while 57% disapprove, the lowest rating of his presidency for this issue. Terrorism has reshaped the public’s agenda, both at home and abroad. Currently, 29% cite terrorism (18%), national security (8%) or ISIS (7%) as the most important problem facing the country today. One year ago, just 4% of the public cited any of these issues. And while ISIS already ranked high among leading international dangers, 83% now regard ISIS as a major threat to the well-being of the U.S., up from 67% in August 2014. Public concerns that anti-terrorism policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties have fallen to their lowest level in five years (28%); twice as many (56%) now say their greater concern is that these policies have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country. However, Americans are not much more likely today to support the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS than they were before the recent terror attacks. Currently, 47% favor the use of U.S. ground forces against ISIS, little changed from July (44%). And overall concerns about the rise of Islamic extremism at home and abroad, while high, are no higher than they were in September 2014. Perceptions about the relationship between Islam and violence also have not changed significantly since last year – though these opinions, already politically polarized, have become even more so. Currently, 46% say the Islamic religion is more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers; about as many (45%) say the Islamic religion does not encourage violence more than other religions. About two-thirds (68%) of Republicans say Islam is more likely to encourage violence, little changed from September 2014 (67%), but the highest share saying this on a question that dates to 2002. In contrast, the share of Democrats associating Islam with violence has declined 12 percentage points since last year, from 42% to 30%. In general, the public rejects by a wide margin the idea of holding U.S. Muslims to increased scrutiny because of their religion. About six-in-ten Americans (61%) say Muslims living in the United States should not be subject to additional scrutiny solely because of their religion; 32% say Muslims should be subject to more scrutiny than people in other religious groups. Conservative Republicans are the only major ideological, demographic or religious group in which a majority (57%) says Muslims in this country should be subject to greater scrutiny than those in other religious groups. Majorities of moderate and liberal Republicans (59%), independents (62%), conservative and moderate Democrats (67%), and liberal Democrats (87%) say Muslims should not receive greater scrutiny solely because of their religion. The survey finds that, as has been the case since 2002, the Republican Party has a sizable advantage over the Democrats on terrorism: 46% of the public says the Republican Party can do better in dealing with the terrorist threat at home, compared with 34% who favor the Democrats. Republicans hold a narrower, six-point edge (43% to 37%) as the party better able to reflect people’s views about gun control. The GOP had an even wider lead on this issue in July (48% to 36%). Neither party has a significant advantage on the economy or immigration, while the Democratic Party holds wide leads over the GOP on both climate change (46% to 32%) and the environment (53% to 30%). Americans are divided about whether they see Islam as more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its believers: 46% say it is more likely, while 45% say it is not more likely. The share of the public saying that Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence has dropped four percentage points since a historical high of 50% in September 2014. For much of the past decade, public views on this measure have been closely divided. The partisan divide over whether Islam encourages violence is now as wide as it has ever been. Fully 68% of Republicans say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, a historical high but little changed since last fall. By contrast, just 30% of Democrats say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, down from 42% in September 2014, but on par with Democratic opinion at other points in recent years. Independents remain split over this question: 45% say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, while the same proportion (45%) say it is not. Ideological divides are even starker, and growing: About three-quarters (77%) of conservative Republicans say that Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions (just 16% say it does not). Liberal Democratic opinion is nearly the inverse: 73% of liberal Democrats say Islam is no more likely than other religions to encourage violence, while 21% believe that it does. The share of liberals saying Islam is more likely to encourage violence is down 14-points since the fall of 2014. Just 32% of those ages 18 to 29 say Islam encourages violence to a greater degree than other faiths, compared with roughly half of those in other age groups. But the age gap in these views is narrower than it was last fall. Today, 51% of Americans 65 and older say Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence; last September, 64% said this. The view that Islam is more violent than other religions is more likely to be held by less educated Americans: 51% of those who have not attended college say this, compared with 40% of those with college degrees and just 35% of those with postgraduate degrees. Racial divides over these views persist. While only 30% of blacks and 40% of Hispanics say Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence, half of whites (50%) say this. Seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, the highest percentage of any religious group and little changed from 2014. By comparison, about half of Catholics (49%) and white mainline Protestants (51%) say this. And among the religiously unaffiliated, just 35% say Islam is more likely to encourage violence among its believers. About six-in-ten (61%) Americans say that there should not be additional scrutiny of Muslims living in the U.S. solely based on their religion as a part of the federal government’s efforts to prevent terrorism. About a third (32%) say Muslims should be subject to greater scrutiny than people in other religious groups. There are wide partisan and ideological divisions on this question. Republicans are roughly evenly divided (49% greater scrutiny, 44% no additional scrutiny), while clear majorities of independents (62%) and Democrats (76%) say U.S. Muslims should not be subject to greater scrutiny because of their religion. Conservative Republicans, in particular, stand apart from other groups as the sole partisan or ideological group in which a majority supports greater scrutiny of Muslims because of their religion: 57% say this, while just 35% say Muslims should not be subject to more attention. In contrast, 59% of moderate and liberal Republicans say they do not think Muslims should be subject to additional scrutiny; about a third (35%) say they should. Liberal Democrats are particularly likely to reject the idea of subjecting Muslims living in the U.S. to closer examination than people of other faiths: 87% say Muslims should not be subject to greater scrutiny than those in other groups, while just 12% say they should. And by greater than two-to-one (67% to 27%), more conservative and moderate Democrats say Muslims should not be scrutinized more than others than say they should. Eight-in-ten (80%) young adults (those 18-29) say scrutiny of U.S. Muslims solely because of their religion should not be a part of the federal government’s efforts to prevent terrorism. And by about two-to-one (63% vs. 30%), those 30 to 49 years old also say this. Views are more divided among those ages 50 and older: half (50%) say Muslims living in the U.S. should be subject to more scrutiny than people in other religious groups, while 41% say they should not be subject to additional scrutiny. Non-whites are more likely than whites to reject the idea of scrutiny of Muslims based on religion: 74% of blacks, along with 66% of Hispanics say Muslims living in the U.S. should not face greater scrutiny solely because of their faith, compared with a narrower majority (57%) of whites. Nearly seven-in-ten postgraduates (69%) and 65% of college graduates say Muslims should not be subject to greater scrutiny. Those without a college degree are somewhat more likely to say Muslims should face more scrutiny because of their religion (34% say this, while 59% say they should not). Majorities of those in most religious groups say Muslims should not face any more scrutiny as a result of their religion. White evangelicals are an exception, and are divided: 50% say Muslims living in the U.S. should be subject to more scrutiny, 43% say they should not. Nearly three-in-ten (29%) Americans cite terrorism (18%), national security (8%) or ISIS (7%) as the most important problem facing the country today. One year ago, just 4% of the public cited any of these issues. The share citing terrorism is the highest it has been since February 2003. The share of the public now mentioning economic issues is lower than at any point in the last eight years: 23% today name an economic issue such as the economy (9%) or unemployment (7%) as the most important problem facing the nation. In December 2014, 34% named an economic issue; nearly half (48%) did so two years ago. In the wake of multiple high-profile mass shootings around the country, 5% of Americans now mention gun control (4%) or mass shootings (2%) as the most important problem today. A year ago, 1% mentioned this as the most important problem. There are wide partisan divides on the most important problem facing the nation. Four-in-ten (41%) Republicans mention terrorism, defense issues and national security or ISIS, while fewer independents (28%) and Democrats (23%) cite these issues. Additionally, Republicans more commonly mention immigration as the most important problem (14%) than do independents (7%) or Democrats (3%). Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite partisan gridlock and division in the country (8% of Democrats vs. 2% of Republicans). Americans’ ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks. For the first time, more now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism (52%) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well (46%). Positive ratings have fallen 26 points since January (when 72% said very/fairly well). Compared to early 2015, assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum. Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority (64%) say the government is doing at least fairly well (down from 85% in January). Independents’ positive ratings have dropped 25 points, from 69% to 44%. And just 27% of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat, down from 63% at the beginning of the year. The views of conservative Republicans, in particular, have turned sharply critical: In January, 59% said the government was doing very well or fairly well; today, only 18% say this. Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism. Among those 50 and older, a majority (57%) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat (42% say that it is). In contrast, 46% of younger adults (those 18-29 years old) give the government’s performance a negative rating, while 53% say it is doing very or fairly well. Evaluations of the government’s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among and those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups: 58% say the government is doing very or fairly well, while 40% say it is doing not too or not at all well. By comparison, 48% of those with a bachelor’s degree, and 44% of those with less education, rate the government’s performance positively. By two-to-one, Americans now say that they are more concerned that the government’s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (56%), rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (28%). Since the start of the year, there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough. Concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically since July 2013, following Edward Snowden’s leaked details about NSA surveillance programs. At that time, more expressed concern that government policies had gone too far restricting civil liberties (47%) than that they did not go far enough to protect the country (35%). The share expressing greater concern that policies do not go far enough to protect the country is now roughly the same as the historical high seen in early 2010, shortly after the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit (when 58% said policies did not go far enough). Both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that the government’s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country (rather than that they have gone too far restricting civil liberties) since Snowden’s disclosures in 2013. But the shift has been more pronounced among Republicans. Slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough, up 14 points since January (57%) and 33 points since July 2013 (38%). A narrower majority of Democrats (54%) now say their greater concern is that government policies do not go far enough, up somewhat since January and 16 points since 2013. Today, similar proportions of conservative Republicans (71%), moderate and liberal Republicans (74%) and conservative and moderate Democrats (67%) say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough. By contrast, equal shares of liberal Democrats say their greater concern is that policies have gone too far in restricting average people’s civil liberties as say they worry more that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country (41% each). Adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties (43%) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country (44%). Majorities in every other age group are more concerned about security than civil liberties, though this concern is more pronounced among those 65 and older (71% say this) than those 30-49 (52%) or 50-64 (60%). The Islamic militant group known as ISIS has risen higher atop the public’s list of global threats to the U.S. Overall, 83% say ISIS is a major threat to the well-being of the United States, while 13% say it is a minor threat and just 3% say it is not a threat. Since August 2014, the public has become 16 points more likely to view ISIS as a major threat to the U.S. For the public, no other international concern comes close to posing the same level of threat as ISIS. Ranking second on the global threats list is Iran’s nuclear program: 62% say this is a major threat to the well-being of the U.S. – 21 points fewer than say the same about ISIS. And while major concern over ISIS is up 16 points from August 2014, no other concern has seen a significant rise in the share viewing it as a major threat to the U.S. since the summer of 2014. The survey, which was in the field during the UN climate change conference in Paris, finds 49% say global climate change is a major threat to the U.S., little different than the 48% who said this in August 2014. Concern over Russia has slipped since August 2014. Last summer, 53% viewed growing tension between Russia and its neighbors as a major threat to the U.S. In the current survey, fewer (42%) say growing authoritarianism in Russia is a major threat. There continue to be wide partisan differences in views of the top international concerns for the U.S. Overall, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see each of these issues as a major threat to the well-being of the U.S.—with the notable exception of climate change. Fully 93% of Republicans view ISIS as a major threat compared with 79% of Democrats and independents. Since August 2014, concern over ISIS has risen about equally across the political spectrum and the partisan gap is no larger today than it was then. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats and independents to view Iran’s nuclear program, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, China’s emergence as a world power, North Korea’s nuclear program and growing authoritarianism in Russia as major threats to the U.S. By contrast, on the issue of global climate change, far more Democrats (73%) than independents (49%) or Republicans (22%) view this as a major threat to the U.S. The 51-point gap in the share of Democrats and Republicans who view global climate change as a major threat is as large a gap measured since Pew Research began asking the question in the fall of 2009. The recent attacks in Paris, France and San Bernardino, Calif. have not led to a fundamental shift in how the public views the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. Overall, a 64%-majority continues to say they approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, while just 28% say they disapprove. Support for the U.S. military effort has been steady over the course of 2015. Democrats (67%) and Republicans (69%) continue to be about equally likely to approve of the military campaign. Slightly fewer (60%) independents express approval. Current ratings of how well the U.S. military effort against ISIS is going remain negative, but there has been an uptick in the view that the U.S. and its allies will ultimately be successful. About six-in-ten (58%) say the U.S. effort against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria is going either not too well (39%) or not at all well (19%); 35% say the campaign is going either very (7%) or fairly (28%) well. Views have changed little on this question over the course of the past year, with majorities consistently offering negative assessments of the current state of the campaign. Views are more positive when it comes to whether the U.S. and its allies will succeed or fail in their military campaign against ISIS. Two-thirds (66%) now say they think the U.S. and its allies will either definitely or probably succeed in their campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, while just 27% say they will definitely or probably fail. The share who say the U.S. and its allies will succeed is up 11 points from July (from 55%). There are wide partisan divides in current assessments of the campaign against ISIS, but more modest ones in predictions of its ultimate success: 45% of Democrats, compared with 33% of independents and just 26% of Republicans say the campaign is going at least fairly well. Six-in-ten or more Republicans (65%), Democrats (72%) and independents (62%) say it will ultimately be successful. Slightly more now say their greater concern about U.S. military action in Iraq and Syria is that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants (50%) than go too far getting involved in the situation (42%). However, these views have shown little change from July, when 48% were more concerned about not going far enough and 43% were more concerned about getting too involved in the situation. Three-quarters of Republicans (75%) say their greater concern about military action in Iraq and Syria is that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the Islamic militants, while just 18% say their greater concern is that the U.S. will become too involved. By contrast, Democrats (61%) say they are more concerned that the U.S. will go too far getting involved in Iraq and Syria than that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the militants there (33%). Conservative Republicans, in particular, express more concern that the U.S. will not go far enough to stop ISIS: 81% say this; only 12% say their greater concern is the U.S. will become too involved. Conversely, two-thirds (67%) of liberal Democrats express more concern that the U.S. will become too involved, while only about a quarter (27%) say their greater concern is that it won’t go far enough. These partisan and ideological divides are slightly more pronounced than they were in July. Concerns over U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria also differ by age. Adults under the age of 30 express more concern about the U.S. going too far in getting involved in the situation (55%) than not going far enough to stop the Islamic militants (37%). All older age groups say they are more concerned about the U.S. not doing enough to stop Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria than getting too involved in the situation. Wide partisan divides exist over whether the U.S. should send ground troops. Two-thirds of Republicans (66%) – including 72% of conservative Republicans – say they would favor sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria, while just 28% are opposed. Among Democrats, views are the reverse: 64% oppose sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria, 33% are in favor. Among independents, about as many favor (48%) as oppose (47%) the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. Views among partisan groups are little different than they were in July 2015. The public is divided over the best approach to confronting global terrorism. Overall, 45% say “using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world,” while about as many (46%) say “relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism.” These attitudes are little changed from earlier this year, but the balance of opinion has shifted since early 2014, before ISIS registered as a major threat for the public. In March 2014, more said relying too much on force creates hatred (57%), compared with 37% who say overwhelming military force was the best way to defeat terrorism. Views were similar to those in 2014 when the question was previously asked in 2011 and 2004. There are wide partisan differences on the question of force and global terrorism. Democrats are far more likely to say relying too much on force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism than to say using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world (66%-27%). By contrast, Republicans are more likely to see overwhelming force as the best way to defeat terrorism by a 72%-18% margin. Independents are more divided: 49% say relying too much on force creates hatred, while 43% say overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world. Both Republicans’ and independents’ support for overwhelming military force as the best way to defeat terrorism rose sharply in February of this year, compared with surveys over the last decade. Since February 2015, however, partisan views have shown little change. While the public is divided on the wisdom of using overwhelming force to defeat terrorism, most see the U.S. as doing more good than harm when it comes to confronting world problems more generally. Overall, 55% say that problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement, compared with fewer (38%) who say U.S. efforts to solve problems around the world usually end up making things worse. Views on this question are unchanged from March of last year, the first time it was asked by the Pew Research Center. Comparable majorities of both Republicans (62%) and Democrats (56%) say world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement. But there is an ideological divide on this question within the Democratic Party. By two to one (62%-31%) more conservative and moderate Democrats say problems in the world would be worse without U.S. efforts. Among liberal Democrats, about as many say U.S. efforts to solve problems usually end up making things worse (45%) as say problems in the world would be even worse without U.S. involvement (50%). Overall, the public continues to worry about Islamic extremism around the world and in the U.S. About six-in-ten (62%) say they are very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, and just about half (49%) say the same about the possible rise of Islamic extremism in the U.S. Comparable percentages said they were very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism in September of last year. These are among the highest levels of concerns measured in the questions’ trend dating to 2007. Republicans remain more likely than Democrats to say they are very concerned with Islamic extremism around the world (83% vs. 53%) and at home (65% vs. 38%). The public continues to have divided views of Barack Obama’s job performance: 46% approve and 49% disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president. His overall rating is little changed over the course of 2015. Obama’s ratings for handling the economy (43% approve) and immigration policy (37% approve) are more negative than positive. He receives mixed ratings for his handling of global climate change (45% approve, 40% disapprove) and race relations (44% approve, 47% disapprove). And for the first time in his presidency, more Americans say they disapprove of the way Obama is handling the threat of terrorism (57%) than approve (37%). Over the course of his first term, the public generally gave Obama positive marks for his handling of the threat of terrorism, peaking at 69% approval in May 2011 following the killing of Osama bin Laden. But his ratings were divided earlier this year (46% approval in May) and now are in negative territory. Views of Obama’s handling of the threat of terrorism have always been strongly associated with partisanship. And his ratings have dropped across all partisan groups. Today, Democrats continue to largely approve of Obama’s handling of the terrorist threat, though to a lesser extent than earlier in his presidency. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Democrats now say they approve, while 29% disapprove. In May, 72% of Democrats approved of his handling of the terrorist threat. Only 11% of Republicans approve of Obama’s handling of the threat posed by terrorism while nearly nine-in-ten (87%) disapprove. Approval on this issue among independents has also reached a historical low. Only a third of independents (33%) now approve of the way Obama is handling the threat of terrorism; roughly six-in-ten (61%) offer a negative appraisal. The public has long been more likely to say Barack Obama is “not tough enough” on foreign policy and national security (58% currently) than say his approach is “about right” (34%) or “too tough” (just 2%). The share now saying Obama is not tough enough is up five percentage points from July (53%), though little different from views at the beginning of the year (55%). Fully 84% of Republicans say Obama’s approach to foreign policy is not tough enough. A 61% majority of independents say the same (30% say it is about right). Most Democrats (58%) view Obama’s approach as about right, while 35% say it is not tough enough (just 2% say it is too tough). Among conservative and moderate Democrats, 45% say Obama is not tough enough, compared with just 26% of liberal Democrats.","Americans are divided about whether they see Islam as more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its believers : 46 % say it is more likely , while 45 % say it is not more likely .

And the millions of students graduating this spring will soon learn just how expensive their degrees were when they start getting student-loan bills. As a Pew Research Center analysis noted last year, nearly one in five U.S. households (19%) owed money on student loans in 2010, more than double the proportion in 1989. Among households headed by someone younger than 35 (i.e., people more likely to be recent college graduates), a record 40% had student-loan debt outstanding. The average student loan balance outstanding in 2010 was $26,682, but 10% of student debtors owed more than $61,894. (Pew Research derived those numbers from the Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve Board.) Somewhat older data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (analyzed by both Pew Research and the College Board) breaks down debt levels by type of institution and degree. As of the 2007-08 academic year, for instance, 25% of students who earned bachelor’s degrees from private nonprofit colleges carried more than $30,000 in debt, compared with 12% of public-college graduates and a remarkable 57% of graduates of private, for-profit schools. According to the College Board, loans from all sources accounted for 40.4% of the $191.8 billion spent on financing undergraduate education in 2011-12. Grants from all sources accounted for 50.6%, with education tax benefits and work-study making up the rest. The College Board figures exclude whatever students and their families pay from their own resources. But according to 2009 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States ranked fifth among 31 major countries studied in terms of reliance on households for funding higher education: 45.3% of total expenditures, trailing Chile, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. (Although three countries — Denmark, Finland and Germany — didn’t separate households from other private-sector funding sources, their total private-funding percentages were well below the U.S.) On average, public sources accounted for about 70% of total higher-ed expenditures in the 31 countries studied by the OECD, versus 38% in the United States.","As a Pew Research Center analysis noted last year , nearly one in five U.S. households ( 19 % ) owed money on student loans in 2010 , more than double the proportion in 1989 .

More broadly, the steady growth in adoption that social platforms have experienced in the United States over the past decade also appears to be slowing. The shares of adults who say they use Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Twitter are each largely the same as in 2016, with only Instagram showing an uptick in use during this time period. (There are no comparable 2016 phone survey data for YouTube, Snapchat, WhatsApp or Reddit.) Facebook – which recently celebrated its 15th anniversary – remains one of the most widely used social media sites among adults in the U.S. Roughly seven-in-ten adults (69%) say they ever use the platform. (A separate 2018 Center survey showed Facebook use among U.S. teens had dropped in recent years.) YouTube is the only other online platform measured that matches Facebook’s reach: 73% of adults report using the video sharing site. But certain online platforms, most notably Instagram and Snapchat, have an especially strong following among young adults. As was true in previous surveys of social media use by the Center, there are substantial age-related differences in platform use. This is especially true of Instagram and Snapchat, which are used by 67% and 62% of 18- to 29-year-olds, respectively. Particularly for these two platforms, there are also pronounced differences in use within the young adult population. Those ages 18 to 24 are substantially more likely than those ages 25 to 29 to say they use Snapchat (73% vs. 47%) and Instagram (75% vs. 57%). By comparison, age differences are less pronounced for Facebook. Facebook use is relatively common across a range of age groups, with 68% of those ages 50 to 64 and nearly half of those 65 and older saying they use the site. Other demographic patterns related to social media and messaging app use are relatively unchanged from last year. Women are nearly three times as likely as men to use Pinterest (42% vs. 15%). Around half of college graduates and those who live in high-income households use LinkedIn, compared with 10% or fewer of those who have not attended at least some college or those in lower-income households. And WhatsApp continues to be popular among Hispanics: 42% use the messaging app, compared with 24% of blacks and 13% of whites. (For more details on social media and messaging app use by different demographic groups, see the bottom of the post.) A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time. But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies, Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago. Roughly three-quarters of Facebook users (74%) visit the site daily, including about half who do so several times a day. These shares are identical to those reported by Facebook users in the Center’s 2018 social media use survey. Majorities of Snapchat and Instagram users also say they visit these sites daily, though they are slightly less likely than Facebook users to do so. The shares of young adults using these platforms daily are especially large. Roughly eight-in-ten Snapchat users ages 18 to 29 (77%) say they use the app every day, including 68% who say they do so multiple times day. Similarly, 76% of Instagram users in this age group visit the site on a daily basis, with 60% reporting that they do so several times per day. These patterns are largely similar to what the Center found in 2018. Other platforms are visited somewhat less frequently. Some 51% of YouTube users say they visit the site daily – a slight increase from the 45% who said this in 2018. Note: See full topline results and methodology here.","A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time .

","Three-quarters of AP and NWP teachers say that the internet and digital search tools have had a “mostly positive” impact on their students’ research habits, but 87% say these technologies are creating an “easily distracted generation with short attention spans” and 64% say today’s digital technologies “do more to distract students than to help them academically.” These complex and at times contradictory judgments emerge from 1) an online survey of more than 2,000 middle and high school teachers drawn from the Advanced Placement (AP) and National Writing Project (NWP) communities; and 2) a series of online and offline focus groups with middle and high school teachers and some of their students. The study was designed to explore teachers’ views of the ways today’s digital environment is shaping the research and writing habits of middle and high school students. Building on the Pew Internet Project’s prior work about how people use the internet and, especially, the information-saturated digital lives of teens, this research looks at teachers’ experiences and observations about how the rise of digital material affects the research skills of today’s students. Overall, teachers who participated in this study characterize the impact of today’s digital environment on their students’ research habits and skills as mostly positive, yet multi-faceted and not without drawbacks. Among the more positive impacts they see: the best students access a greater depth and breadth of information on topics that interest them; students can take advantage of the availability of educational material in engaging multimedia formats; and many become more self-reliant researchers. At the same time, these teachers juxtapose these benefits against some emerging concerns. Specifically, some teachers worry about students’ overdependence on search engines; the difficulty many students have judging the quality of online information; the general level of literacy of today’s students; increasing distractions pulling at students and poor time management skills; students’ potentially diminished critical thinking capacity; and the ease with which today’s students can borrow from the work of others. These teachers report that students rely mainly on search engines to conduct research, in lieu of other resources such as online databases, the news sites of respected news organizations, printed books, or reference librarians. Overall, the vast majority of these teachers say a top priority in today’s classrooms should be teaching students how to “judge the quality of online information.” As a result, a significant portion of the teachers surveyed here report spending class time discussing with students how search engines work, how to assess the reliability of the information they find online, and how to improve their search skills. They also spend time constructing assignments that point students toward the best online resources and encourage the use of sources other than search engines. These are among the main findings of an online survey of a non-probability sample of 2,462 middle and high school teachers currently teaching in the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, conducted between March 7 and April 23, 2012. Some 1,750 of the teachers are drawn from a sample of advanced placement (AP) high school teachers, while the remaining 712 are from a sample of National Writing Project teachers. Survey findings are complemented by insights from a series of online and in-person focus groups with middle and high school teachers and students in grades 9-12, conducted between November, 2011 and February, 2012. This particular sample is quite diverse geographically, by subject matter taught, and by school size and community characteristics. But it skews towards “cutting edge” educators who teach some of the most academically successful students in the country. Thus, the findings reported here reflect the realities of their special place in American education, and are not necessarily representative of all teachers in all schools. At the same time, these findings are especially powerful given that these teachers’ observations and judgments emerge from some of the nation’s most advanced classrooms. The internet and digital technologies are significantly impacting how students conduct research: 77% of these teachers say the overall impact is “mostly positive,” but they sound many cautionary notes Asked to assess the overall impact of the internet and digital technologies on students’ research habits, 77% of these teachers say it has been “mostly positive.” Yet, when asked if they agree or disagree with specific assertions about how the internet is impacting students’ research, their views are decidedly mixed. On the more encouraging side, virtually all (99%) AP and NWP teachers in this study agree with the notion that the internet enables students to access a wider range of resources than would otherwise be available, and 65% also agree that the internet makes today’s students more self-sufficient researchers. At the same time, 76% of teachers surveyed “strongly agree” with the assertion that internet search engines have conditioned students to expect to be able to find information quickly and easily. Large majorities also agree with the assertion that the amount of information available online today is overwhelming to most students (83%) and that today’s digital technologies discourage students from using a wide range of sources when conducting research (71%). Fewer teachers, but still a majority of this sample (60%), agree with the assertion that today’s technologies make it harder for students to find credible sources of information. The internet has changed the very meaning of “research” Perhaps the greatest impact this group of teachers sees today’s digital environment having on student research habits is the degree to which it has changed the very nature of “research” and what it means to “do research.” Teachers and students alike report that for today’s students, “research” means “Googling.” As a result, some teachers report that for their students “doing research” has shifted from a relatively slow process of intellectual curiosity and discovery to a fast-paced, short-term exercise aimed at locating just enough information to complete an assignment. These perceptions are evident in teachers’ survey responses: 94% of the teachers surveyed say their students are “very likely” to use Google or other online search engines in a typical research assignment, placing it well ahead of all other sources that we asked about. Second and third on the list of frequently used sources are online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia, and social media sites such as YouTube. In descending order, the sources teachers in our survey say students are “very likely” to use in a typical research assignment: In response to this trend, many teachers say they shape research assignments to address what they feel can be their students’ overdependence on search engines and online encyclopedias. Nine in ten (90%) direct their students to specific online resources they feel are most appropriate for a particular assignment, and 83% develop research questions or assignments that require students to use a wider variety of sources, both online and offline. Most teachers encourage online research, including the use of digital technologies such as cell phones to find information quickly, yet point to barriers in the school environment impeding quality online research Asked which online activities they have students engage in, 95% of the teachers in this survey report having students “do research or search for information online,” making it the most common online task. Conducting research online is followed by accessing or downloading assignments (79%) or submitting assignments (75%) via online platforms. These teachers report using a wide variety of digital tools in their classrooms and assignments, well beyond the typical desktop and laptop computers. Specifically, majorities say they and/or their students use cell phones (72%), digital cameras (66%), and digital video recorders (55%) either in the classroom or to complete school assignments. Cell phones are becoming particularly popular learning tools, and are now as common to these teachers’ classrooms as computer carts. According to respondents, the most popular school task students use cell phones for is “to look up information in class,” cited by 42% of the teachers participating in the survey. Yet, survey results also indicate teachers face a variety of challenges in incorporating digital tools into their classrooms, some of which, they suggest, may hinder how students are taught to conduct research online. Virtually all teachers surveyed work in a school that employs internet filters (97%), formal policies about cell phone use (97%) and acceptable use policies or AUPs (97%). The degree to which teachers feel these policies impact their teaching varies, with internet filters cited most often as having a “major impact” on survey participants’ teaching (32%). One in five teachers (21%) say cell phone policies have a “major” impact on their teaching, and 16% say the same about their school’s AUP. These impacts are felt most strongly among those teaching the lowest income students. Teachers give students’ research skills modest ratings Despite viewing the overall impact of today’s digital environment on students’ research habits as “mostly positive,” teachers rate the actual research skills of their students as “good” or “fair” in most cases. Very few teachers rate their students “excellent” on any of the research skills included in the survey. This is notable, given that the majority of the sample teaches Advanced Placement courses to the most academically advanced students. Students receive the highest marks from these teachers for their ability to use appropriate and effective search queries and their understanding of how online search results are generated. Yet even for these skills, only about one-quarter of teachers surveyed here rate their students “excellent” or “very good.” Indeed, in our focus groups, many teachers suggest that despite being raised in the “digital age,” today’s students are surprisingly lacking in their online search skills. Students receive the lowest marks for “patience and determination in looking for information that is hard to find,” with 43% of teachers rating their students “poor” in this regard, and another 35% rating their students “fair.” Given these perceived deficits in key skills, it is not surprising that 80% of teachers surveyed say they spend class time discussing with students how to assess the reliability of online information, and 71% spend class time discussing how to conduct research online in general. Another 57% spend class time helping students improve their search skills and 35% devote class time to helping students understand how search engines work and how search results are generated. In addition, asked what curriculum changes might be necessary in middle and high schools today, 47% “strongly agree” and 44% “somewhat agree” that courses or content focusing on digital literacy must be incorporated into every school’s curriculum. A richer information environment, but at the price of distracted students? Teachers are evenly divided on the question of whether today’s students are fundamentally different from previous generations; 47% agree and 52% disagree with the statement that “today’s students are really no different than previous generations, they just have different tools through which to express themselves.” Responses to this item were consistent across the full sample of teachers regardless of the teachers’ age or experience level, the subject or grade level taught, or the type of community in which they teach. At the same time, asked whether they agree or disagree that “today’s students have fundamentally different cognitive skills because of the digital technologies they have grown up with,” 88% of the sample agree, including 40% who “strongly agree.” Teachers of the lowest income students are the most likely to “strongly agree” with this statement (46%) but the differences across student socioeconomic status are slight, and there are no other notable differences across subgroups of teachers in the sample. Overwhelming majorities of these teachers also agree with the assertions that “today’s digital technologies are creating an easily distracted generation with short attention spans” (87%) and “today’s students are too ‘plugged in’ and need more time away from their digital technologies” (86%). Two-thirds (64%) agree with the notion that “today’s digital technologies do more to distract students than to help them academically.” In focus groups, some teachers commented on the connection they see between students’ “overexposure” to technology, and the resulting lack of focus and diminished ability to retain knowledge they see among some students. Time management is also becoming a serious issue among students, according to some teachers; in their experience, today’s digital technologies not only encourage students to assume all tasks can be finished quickly and at the last minute, but students also use various digital tools at their disposal to “waste time” and procrastinate. Thus, despite 77% of the survey respondents describing the overall impact of the internet and digital technologies on students’ research habits as “mostly positive,” the broad story is more complex. While majorities of teachers surveyed see the internet and other digital technologies encouraging broader and deeper learning by connecting students to more resources about topics that interest them, enabling them to access multimedia content, and broadening their worldviews, these teachers are at the same time concerned about digital distractions and students’ abilities to focus on tasks and manage their time. While some frame these issues as stemming directly from digital technologies and the particular students they teach, others suggest the concerns actually reflect a slow response from parents and educators to shape their own expectations and students’ learning environments in a way that better reflects the world today’s students live in. About the data collection Data collection was conducted in two phases. In phase one, Pew Internet conducted two online and one in-person focus group with middle and high school teachers; focus group participants included Advanced Placement (AP) teachers, teachers who had participated in the National Writing Project’s Summer Institute (NWP), as well as teachers at a College Board school in the Northeast U.S. Two in-person focus groups were also conducted with students in grades 9-12 from the same College Board school. The goal of these discussions was to hear teachers and students talk about, in their own words, the different ways they feel digital technologies such as the internet, search engines, social media, and cell phones are shaping students’ research and writing habits and skills. Teachers were asked to speak in depth about teaching research and writing to middle and high school students today, the challenges they encounter, and how they incorporate digital technologies into their classrooms and assignments. Focus group discussions were instrumental in developing a 30-minute online survey, which was administered in phase two of the research to a national sample of middle and high school teachers. The survey results reported here are based on a non-probability sample of 2,462 middle and high school teachers currently teaching in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Of these 2,462 teachers, 2,067 completed the entire survey; all percentages reported are based on those answering each question. The sample is not a probability sample of all teachers because it was not practical to assemble a sampling frame of this population. Instead, two large lists of teachers were assembled: one included 42,879 AP teachers who had agreed to allow the College Board to contact them (about one-third of all AP teachers), while the other was a list of 5,869 teachers who participated in the National Writing Project’s Summer Institute during 2007-2011 and who were not already part of the AP sample. A stratified random sample of 16,721 AP teachers was drawn from the AP teacher list, based on subject taught, state, and grade level, while all members of the NWP list were included in the final sample. The online survey was conducted from March 7–April 23, 2012. More details on how the survey and focus groups were conducted are included in the Methodology section at the end of this report, along with focus group discussion guides and the survey instrument. About the teachers who participated in the survey There are several important ways the teachers who participated in the survey are unique, which should be considered when interpreting the results reported here. First, 95% of the teachers who participated in the survey teach in public schools, thus the findings reported here reflect that environment almost exclusively. In addition, almost one-third of the sample (NWP Summer Institute teachers) has received extensive training in how to effectively teach writing in today’s digital environment. The National Writing Project’s mission is to provide professional development, resources and support to teachers to improve the teaching of writing in today’s schools. The NWP teachers included here are what the organization terms “teacher-consultants” who have attended the Summer Institute and provide local leadership to other teachers. Research has shown significant gains in the writing performance of students who are taught by these teachers.1 Moreover, the majority of teachers participating in the survey (56%) currently teach AP, honors, and/or accelerated courses, thus the population of middle and high school students they work with skews heavily toward the highest achievers. These teachers and their students may have resources and support available to them—particularly in terms of specialized training and access to digital tools—that are not available in all educational settings. Thus, the population of teachers participating in this research might best be considered “leading edge teachers” who are actively involved with the College Board and/or the National Writing Project and are therefore beneficiaries of resources and training not common to all teachers. It is likely that teachers in this study are developing some of the more innovative pedagogical approaches to teaching research and writing in today’s digital environment, and are incorporating classroom technology in ways that are not typical of the entire population of middle and high school teachers in the U.S. Survey findings represent the attitudes and behaviors of this particular group of teachers only, and are not representative of the entire population of U.S. middle and high school teachers. Every effort was made to administer the survey to as broad a group of educators as possible from the sample files being used. As a group, the 2,462 teachers participating in the survey comprise a wide range of subject areas, experience levels, geographic regions, school type and socioeconomic level, and community type (detailed sample characteristics are available in the Methodology section of this report). The sample includes teachers from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All teachers who participated in the survey teach in physical schools and classrooms, as opposed to teaching online or virtual courses. English/language arts teachers make up a significant portion of the sample (36%), reflecting the intentional design of the study, but history, social science, math, science, foreign language, art, and music teachers are also represented. About one in ten teachers participating in the survey are middle school teachers, while 91% currently teach grades 9-12. There is wide distribution across school size and students’ socioeconomic status, though half of the teachers participating in the survey report teaching in a small city or suburb. There is also a wide distribution in the age and experience levels of participating teachers. The survey sample is 71% female. About the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project The Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project is one of seven projects that make up the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit “fact tank” that provides information on the issues, attitudes and trends shaping America and the world. The Project produces reports exploring the impact of the internet on families, communities, work and home, daily life, education, health care, and civic and political life. The Pew Internet Project takes no positions on policy issues related to the internet or other communications technologies. It does not endorse technologies, industry sectors, companies, nonprofit organizations, or individuals. While we thank our research partners for their helpful guidance, the Pew Internet Project had full control over the design, implementation, analysis and writing of this survey and report. About the College Board The College Board is a mission-driven not-for-profit organization that connects students to college success and opportunity. Founded in 1900, the College Board was created to expand access to higher education. Today, the membership association is made up of over 6,000 of the world’s leading educational institutions and is dedicated to promoting excellence and equity in education. Each year, the College Board helps more than seven million students prepare for a successful transition to college through programs and services in college readiness and college success — including the SAT® and the Advanced Placement Program®. The organization also serves the education community through research and advocacy on behalf of students, educators and schools. For further information, visit www.collegeboard.org. About the National Writing Project The National Writing Project (NWP) is a nationwide network of educators working together to improve the teaching of writing in the nation’s schools and in other settings. NWP provides high-quality professional development programs to teachers in a variety of disciplines and at all levels, from early childhood through university. Through its nearly 200 university-based sites serving all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, NWP develops the leadership, programs and research needed for teachers to help students become successful writers and learners.

At least two of those candidates won their races and will be heading to Congress in 2021. Here are five facts about how much Americans have heard about the QAnon conspiracy theories and their views about them, based on Pew Research Center surveys and analysis. Americans’ awareness of the conspiracy theories called QAnon increased dramatically from early to late 2020. In a Feb. 18-March 2 survey, about a quarter (23%) of U.S. adults said they had heard “a lot” or “a little” about QAnon. By September, that number had increased to 47%. At the same time, though, very few Americans have heard a lot about it: 9% as of September, up from 3% in February. Knowledge of QAnon grew on both sides of the political aisle, though Democrats’ awareness continues to outpace that of Republicans. As of September, more than half (55%) of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say they have heard at least a little about the conspiracy theories, compared with 39% of Republicans. The same U.S. adults were sampled for the March survey and September survey. This raises the possibility that some of the increase in QAnon awareness is attributable to re-asking the same people. Americans with high political knowledge are more likely than others to have heard of the conspiracy theories. Within both parties, political knowledge correlates closely with awareness of these theories. Among Democrats, those with high political knowledge are more than three times as likely to say they have heard about QAnon (85%) as those with low political knowledge (25%). And though fewer Republicans overall have heard of QAnon, those with high political knowledge are more than twice as likely (59%) as those with low political knowledge (24%) to have heard at least a little about QAnon. (You can find more details of the political knowledge index here.) High or low political knowledge is a stronger factor in awareness of the conspiracy theories than differences in ideology within each party. The differences seen between Democrats with high and low knowledge are much larger than the differences seen between liberal Democrats and conservative or moderate Democrats, and the same is true among Republicans. The majority of Americans who have heard of QAnon think it’s a bad thing for the country. Among those who have heard of the conspiracy theories, 57% say QAnon is a “very bad” thing for the country. Another 17% say it is “somewhat bad.” That compares with 20% who say it is a somewhat or very good thing, while 6% did not answer. Democrats who have heard of QAnon are more likely than their Republican counterparts to say it’s bad for the country. Almost eight-in-ten Democrats who have heard of QAnon (77%) say it is a “very bad” thing for the country, and another 13% say it is a somewhat bad thing. On the other hand, only about a quarter of Republicans who have heard of QAnon (26%) feel it is very bad for the country, while 24% say it is somewhat bad. Indeed, roughly four-in-ten Republicans who have heard of QAnon (41%) say it is a good thing for the country (32% somewhat good and 9% very good). When asked to describe QAnon, people most often mentioned that it was a group of some kind (41%) or a conspiracy group or theory (44%). When Americans who said they had heard at least a little about QAnon were asked to write in their own words what they thought it was, they were most likely to describe it as a group of some kind or include a more specific description of it as a conspiracy group or theory. Far fewer wrote in other kinds of descriptions. Two-in-ten mentioned that it is a right-wing group or theory (20%) or that it is a theory about child abuse or trafficking (20%). Another 16% connected it directly to President Donald Trump, either by saying that Trump supports the group or that the group views him as a hero, savior or victim. (Responses could fit into more than one of these categories.) A separate content study of YouTube by the Center found that in December 2019, mentions of “QAnon” were concentrated in a very small number of the most viewed news channels. Overall, 5% of videos published by the 100 most viewed YouTube news channels at the time of the study included the word “QAnon.” The vast majority of those mentions came from just a handful of YouTube news channels: 11 of these channels studied produced 80% of the videos mentioning QAnon. In a subsequent content analysis conducted in September 2020, eight of these 11 YouTube news channels were still producing videos that mentioned QAnon. What’s more, four of them mentioned QAnon in half or more of the videos they published that month. Some of these channels clearly advertised their orientation around these conspiracy theories, including one that put the word “QAnon” in the thumbnail of all of its videos. Other channels were more subtle in their mentions, using euphemisms such as “our favorite anon.” Several of the 11 channels were terminated by YouTube in October, including some channels that mentioned QAnon the most in September 2020. Note: Here is the methodology for this report.","When asked to describe QAnon , people most often mentioned that it was a group of some kind ( 41 % ) or a conspiracy group or theory ( 44 % ) .

A majority of Americans (55%) now say that the campaign is too negative. This is up significantly from 43% a month ago and represents a dramatic change from the beginning of the primary season when only 28% said the campaign was too negative. Perceptions of the tone of the current campaign are nearly identical to views of the 2004 presidential campaign. In October, 2004, 57% of registered voters said the campaign was too negative. In spite of criticism about the tone of the campaign, the public remains highly engaged in the process. Fully 71% say the campaign is interesting, and a strong majority (63%) says the campaign has been informative thus far. Furthermore, the percent saying the campaign is too long has actually fallen since April, when the election was still more than six months away. Democrats and independents are more likely than Republicans to say the campaign has been too negative. In September, there were only slight differences among the three groups – Democrats, independents and Republicans all narrowly said the campaign was not too negative. Today, 62% of Democrats and 57% of independents say the campaign is too negative, while only 47% of Republicans agree. Changing sentiments about the tone of the campaign coincide with a dramatic increase in the percentage of Americans who have seen the presidential candidates’ television commercials in recent weeks. Fully 80% say they have seen a television commercial on behalf of Barack Obama’s candidacy recently and nearly as many (76%) report having seen a commercial on behalf of John McCain. In mid-September, only 54% of the public had seen an ad for Obama and 58% had seen a McCain ad. On balance, those who have seen Obama’s ads believe they are truthful. Nearly half (47%) say Obama’s ads are truthful, while 24% say they are not truthful. The public is more evenly split over the truthfulness of McCain’s campaign ads: 35% say they are truthful, while 33% say they are not. Democrats overwhelmingly believe that Obama’s television ads are truthful, while they doubt the veracity of McCain’s. Similarly, Republicans believe McCain’s ads are truthful, while a plurality says Obama’s are not. Independents have a much more favorable view of Obama’s ads than they do of McCain’s. By a margin of 42%-26% independents say Obama’s ads are truthful. When it comes to McCain’s ads, independents are evenly divided: 32% say they are truthful and 33% say they are not. The public has consistently found the presidential campaign to be interesting. Seven-in-ten said it was interesting in February 2008; 59% in April; and 68% in mid-September. Nearly two-thirds (63%) now say the campaign has been informative, while only 34% say it has not been informative. Democrats are more likely than Republicans or independents to find the campaign interesting and informative. Fully 80% of Democrats say the campaign has been interesting, compared with 70% of Republicans and 65% of independents. Similarly, while 70% of Democrats say the campaign has been informative, fewer independents (61%) and Republicans (57%) agree. A majority of the public (57%) says the campaign has been too long, while 39% say it has not been too long. Republicans and independents are more likely than Democrats to say the campaign has been too long. This year’s voters are somewhat more likely than voters in 2004 to say the campaign has been too long (57% this year vs. 51% in 2004). The public continued to pay close attention to campaign news last week. More than half (52%) say they followed the campaign very closely, down marginally from 57% the previous week. Fully half have heard a lot about Obama’s connection to former 1960’s radical William Ayers, while 35% have heard a little about this. Only 15% say they haven’t heard anything at all about the Ayers controversy. Roughly equal proportions of Democrats and Republicans have heard a lot about this story. Compared to other campaign events, public awareness of the Ayers story is similar to awareness of videos of Obama’s former pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright making controversial statements when that story first broke earlier this year (51% had heard a lot about the Wright videos in late March). Public views of the candidates continue to fluctuate. For John McCain and Sarah Palin, changing views are more negative than positive. In the survey conducted Oct. 10-13, fully a third of the public say their opinion of McCain has become less favorable in recent days, while only 17% say their view of the GOP nominee has become more favorable. Views of Sarah Palin also turned more negative: 38% say their opinion of Palin has become less favorable in recent days, while 21% say their opinion of the Alaska governor has become more favorable. Palin’s public image had improved significantly the week of the vice presidential debate. Since then, the views of Republicans, who rallied behind her after the debate, have become more static, and the views of independents have become less favorable. Obama’s image improved somewhat last week: 29% say their view of the Democratic nominee has become more favorable in recent days while 21% say it has become less favorable. Views of Joe Biden have changed relatively little: 23% say their opinion of Biden has become more favorable recently, 14% say their opinion has become less favorable and 56% say their view of Biden has not changed in recent days. While the two presidential candidates received roughly the same amount of news coverage last week, Obama was clearly the most visible candidate in the eyes of the public. According to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, Obama was featured prominently in 79% of all campaign news stories last week and McCain was featured in 74%. More than half of the public (53%) says Obama was the candidate they heard the most about in the news last week, while only 25% name McCain. McCain was the most visible candidate for two weeks during and after the Republican convention. Since that time, Obama has been steadily boosting his position as the most heard about candidate. Heading into the final weeks of the campaign, public opinion is divided on the question of how well the press is covering the race. A slim majority (53%) rates coverage of the campaign as excellent or good, while another 45% say it is only fair or poor. In June, press ratings were nearly the reverse, with a narrow majority (54%) calling the coverage only fair or poor and somewhat fewer rating it excellent or good (43%). Impressions of press coverage run strongly along party lines. In the current poll, fully 70% of Democrats rate press coverage positively, but fewer than four-in-ten (38%) Republicans share this view. Independents, meanwhile, are divided on the subject. From June to now, the opinions of Republicans have not changed, but among Democrats the share who rate the job the press is doing positively increased 20 points (50% ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ in June and 70% now). A greater percentage of women than men give the press high marks on how well they are covering the campaign. Six-in-ten women (59%) rate the job the press is doing as excellent or good, while fewer than half (46%) of men do. Notably, in early June at the close of primary season, majorities of both men (55%) and women (54%) saw campaign coverage as only fair or poor. Opinions about the quality of campaign coverage appear to be correlated with age. A 59% majority of young people (ages 18-34) rate press coverage positively, while middle-aged Americans are more divided on the quality of campaign reporting. Among older Americans (those 65 and older), most say the coverage is only fair or poor (53%), compared with 44% who say it is excellent or good. From the public’s perspective, some aspects of the presidential campaign have been covered better than others. Americans give the press high marks for coverage of the candidate debates and reporting on which candidate is leading in the latest polls. For both of these facets of the campaign, 62% say that the press has done an excellent or good job and a third says its performance has been only fair or poor. About half (52%) say that the press has done only a fair or poor job in covering campaign strategies and the same percentage says this about coverage of the candidates’ positions on issues. Somewhat fewer view coverage of these two aspects of the campaign positively. In both cases, 44% say that campaign reporting has been excellent or good. The area in which the public sees the greatest weakness in campaign coverage is in news about the candidates’ personal backgrounds and experiences. A majority (54%) say that the press has done only a fair or poor job, while roughly four-in-ten (41%) say the coverage has been excellent or good. As seen in their overall ratings of campaign coverage, Republicans express more critical views on specific aspects of campaign reporting than either Democrats or independents. Roughly two thirds of Republicans offer only fair or poor ratings for how well the press has covered campaign strategies (66%), candidates’ backgrounds (65%) and the issue positions they hold (64%). These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected from October 6-12 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected October 10-13 from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults. A substantial majority of Americans (65%) continued to pay very close attention to news about the economy last week. This is down slightly from 69% the previous week but still extremely high from a historical perspective. In addition, 59% followed news about the recent downturn in the U.S. stock market very closely. Interest in stock market news was particularly high among college graduates, those with annual household incomes of $75,000 or higher and those 50 and older. Overall, nearly two-thirds of Americans (63%) list either economic conditions or the stock market drop as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week. One-in-four (24%) list the campaign as their most closely followed story. For its part, the national news media divided its focus between the economy and the campaign last week. According to Pew’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, 41% of the national newshole last week was devoted to the presidential campaign, while 36% was devoted to the current financial crisis. In a footnote to the larger economic crisis, 52% of the public say they heard a lot about executives from insurance giant AIG holding a retreat at a luxury resort shortly after the company received billions of dollars from the federal government. Another 26% heard a little about this story and 21% heard nothing at all. Nearly as many (48%) heard a lot about General Motors stock falling to its lowest level in 58 years. Relatively few Americans heard a lot about last weekend’s White House meeting among President Bush and G-7 finance ministers (29%). In other news last week, 23% of the public followed news about the Iraq war very closely and 19% paid very close attention to news about the war in Afghanistan. Very few listed either of these stories as their most closely followed news story of the week (2% for each). Only 8% followed news of O.J. Simpson’s conviction on charges of kidnapping and armed robbery very closely. Another 13% followed the news fairly closely. The public was much more interested in this story when Simpson was arrested in September, 2007: 13% followed news about the arrest very closely, 27% followed it fairly closely. About the News Interest Index The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Sunday through Friday) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

Enthusiasm for democracy and capitalism has waned considerably over the past 20 years, and most believe the changes that have taken place since 1991 have had a negative impact on public morality, law and order, and standards of living. There is a widespread perception that political and business elites have enjoyed the spoils of the last two decades, while average citizens have been left behind. Still, people in these three former Soviet republics have not turned their backs on democratic values; indeed, they embrace key features of democracy, such as a fair judiciary and free media. However, they do not believe their countries have fully developed these institutions. In contrast to today’s grim mood, optimism was relatively high in the spring of 1991, when the Times Mirror Center surveyed Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania. At that time all three were still part of the decaying USSR (which formally dissolved on December 25, 1991).1 Then, solid majorities in all three republics approved of moving to a multiparty democracy. Now, just 35% of Ukrainians and only about half in Russia and Lithuania approve of the switch to a multiparty system. As was the case two decades ago, the shift towards democracy tends to be more popular among those who are perhaps best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities provided by an open society. In all three countries, young people, the well-educated and urban dwellers express the most support for their country’s move to a multiparty system. People in these former Soviet republics are much less confident that democracy can solve their country’s problems than they were in 1991. When asked whether they should rely on a democratic form of government or a leader with a strong hand to solve their national problems, only about three-in-ten Russians and Ukrainians choose democracy, down significantly from 1991. Roughly half (52%) say this in Lithuania, a 27-percentage-point decline from the level recorded two decades ago. When asked about the current state of democracy in their country, big majorities in all three former republics say they are dissatisfied. Moreover, in Lithuania and Ukraine, dissatisfaction has increased in just the last two years. A fall 2009 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that 60% of Lithuanians said they were dissatisfied with the way democracy was working; today 72% say so. In Ukraine, unhappiness with the state of democracy has risen from 70% to 81%. These are among the major findings from a survey by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, conducted in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania from March 21 to April 7 as part of a broader 23-nation poll in spring 2011. The survey reexamines a number of issues first explored in a spring 1991 survey conducted by the Times Mirror Center, the predecessor of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. This report also presents a number of key findings from a fall 2009 Pew Global Attitudes survey, conducted in these three nations, as well as in 10 other European countries and the United States. (See “ End of Communism Cheered but Now with More Reservations ,” released November 2, 2009.) Large majorities in all three nations believe that elites have prospered over the last two decades, while average citizens have not. In Ukraine, for instance, 95% think politicians have benefited a great deal or a fair amount from the changes since 1991, and 76% say this about business owners. However, just 11% believe ordinary people have benefited. The fall 2009 survey further highlighted the extent to which these publics are disillusioned with their political leadership. Few believed politicians listened to them or that politicians governed with the interests of the people in mind. Just 26% of Russians, 23% of Ukrainians, and 15% of Lithuanians agreed with the statement “most elected officials care what people like me think.” And only 37% in Russia, 23% in Lithuania, and 20% in Ukraine agreed that “generally, the state is run for the benefit of all the people.” As the findings of the 2009 survey make clear, there is a considerable gap between the democratic aspirations of Eastern Europeans and their perceptions of how democracy actually works in the former Eastern bloc. In all three former Soviet republics surveyed, the 2009 poll found widespread support for specific features of democracy, such as a fair judiciary, honest elections, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free speech and civilian control of the military. Majorities consistently said it was important to live in a country that had these key democratic institutions and values, and large numbers believed most of these features were very important. However, considerably fewer thought their countries actually had these democratic institutions and freedoms. Just as views about democracy have soured over the past two decades, so have attitudes toward capitalism. In 1991, 76% of Lithuanians approved of switching to a market economy; now, only 45% approve. Among Ukrainians, approval fell from 52% in 1991 to 34% today. Meanwhile, 42% of Russians currently endorse the free market approach, a 12-percentage-point drop since 1991, eight points of which occurred in just the last two years. In all three nations, young people and the college educated are more likely to embrace free markets. Waning confidence in capitalism may be tied at least in part to frustration with the current economic situation. Only 29% of Russians say their economy is in good shape, while Lithuanians and Ukrainians offer even bleaker assessments. Among the 23 nations from regions around the world included in the spring 2011 Pew Global Attitudes survey, Lithuanians (9% good) and Ukrainians (6%) give their economies the lowest ratings. (For more, see “ China Seen Overtaking U.S. as Global Superpower ,” released July 13, 2011.) Moreover, optimism about the economic future is in short supply. More than four-in-ten Ukrainians (44%) expect their economy to worsen over the next 12 months, while 36% believe it will stay about the same, and just 15% think it will improve. Optimism is also sparse in Lithuania, with 31% saying things will worsen, 43% saying things will stay the same, and 21% suggesting the situation will improve. Russians see things a bit more positively: 18% worsen, 46% remain the same, 28% improve. Many in these three nations believe the enormous transformations that have taken place since the demise of the Soviet Union have had negative consequences for their societies. In particular, majorities in all three say the changes since 1991 have had a bad influence on the standard of living, the way people in society treat one another, law and order, and public morality. Overall, Lithuanians are less negative than Ukrainians and Russians about the impact of the post-Soviet era. For example, majorities in the latter two nations say the changes have negatively affected national pride, while only 30% of Lithuanians hold this view. Even so, Lithuanians are generally more negative about the impact of these changes today than they were in 1991, when the Times Mirror Center survey asked about the dramatic shifts that were underway. Conversely, Russians and Ukrainians have actually become slightly less negative since 1991, when they were even more likely than they are today to believe the changes were having a bad impact on their societies. Lithuanians also stand apart when it comes to questions about individualism and the locus of responsibility for success in life. Most Lithuanians (55%) believe that people who get ahead these days do so because they have more ability and ambition, compared with only 38% of Russians and 32% of Ukrainians. Similarly, 58% in Lithuania think that most people who do not succeed in life fail because of their own individual shortcomings, rather than because of society’s failures. Just 47% of Russians and 40% of Ukrainians express this opinion. Still, there is consensus across all three nations that the state’s role in guaranteeing individual freedom should not trump its responsibility for providing a social safety net. When asked which is more important, “that everyone be free to pursue their life’s goals without interference from the state” or “that the state play an active role in society so as to guarantee that nobody is in need,” more than two-thirds choose the latter in Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania. Moreover, the belief that the state must ensure that no one is in need has become significantly more common since 1991 in all three nations. Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet empire, roughly half of Russians (48%) believe it is natural for their country to have an empire, while just 33% disagree with this idea. By contrast, in 1991, during the final months of the USSR, significantly fewer (37%) thought it was natural for Russia to have an empire, while 43% disagreed. Half of Russians also agree with the statement “it is a great misfortune that the Soviet Union no longer exists;” 36% disagree. This is a slight decline from 2009, when 58% agreed and 38% disagreed. Russians ages 50 and older tend to express more nostalgia for the Soviet era than do those under 50. Despite widespread nationalist sentiments, Russian attitudes toward Ukrainians and Lithuanians in their country are largely positive – 80% express a favorable view of the Ukrainians and 62% give a positive rating to Lithuanians. For their part, Ukrainians express overwhelmingly positive views about Russians, Poles, and Lithuanians in their country. Similarly, in Lithuania, attitudes toward Russians, Ukrainians, and Poles are all generally positive. Attitudes toward the European Union and NATO are overwhelming positive in Lithuania, which joined both organizations in 2004. In fact, Lithuanians give the EU its highest rating among the 23 countries included in the spring 2011 poll. Even so, just about half of Lithuanians view their country’s EU membership positively – 49% believe it is a good thing, 31% say it is neither good nor bad, and 8% say it is bad. Lithuanians give the United States largely positive marks – 73% have a favorable opinion of the U.S. Attitudes toward Russia are also positive on balance (53% favorable, 42% unfavorable), but not as positive as for the EU, NATO, and U.S. Most Ukrainians express favorable opinions of the EU (72%) and U.S. (60%), but NATO is not viewed as warmly (34%). The vast majority of Ukrainians (84%) have a positive view of Russia. As is the case in Ukraine, most Russians give the EU (64%) and U.S. (56%) positive reviews, but not NATO (37%).","Half of Russians also agree with the statement “ it is a great misfortune that the Soviet Union no longer exists ; ” 36 % disagree .

Younger adults are leading the way in increased mobility, preferring laptops to desktops and using their cell phones for a variety of functions, including internet, email, music, games, and video. Among the findings: Additionally, about one in 11 (9%) adults do not own any of the devices we asked about, including 43% of adults age 75 and older. In terms of generations, Millennials are by far the most likely group not only to own most of the devices we asked about, but also to take advantage of a wider range of functions. For instance, while cell phones have become ubiquitous in American households, most cell phone owners only use two of the main non-voice functions on their phones: taking pictures and text messaging. Among Millennials, meanwhile, a majority use their phones also for going online, sending email, playing games, listening to music, and recording videos. However, Gen X is also very similar to Millennials in ownership of certain devices, such as game consoles. Members of Gen X are also more likely than Millennials to own a desktop computer. e-Book readers and tablet computers so far have not seen significant differences in ownership between generations, although members of the oldest generation (adults age 75 and older) are less likely than younger generations to own these devices. These findings are based on a survey of 3,001 American adults (ages 18 and older) conducted between August 9 and September 13, 2010. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish, and the survey included 1,000 cell phone interviews. (More information is availabe in the Methodology section.) In this chart, the dips in tech ownership registered in the September 2010 survey are mostly a result of the fact that Spanish interviews were added to the survey. Most of the Pew Internet surveys before 2010 were only conducted in English. The Project has added Spanish to this survey and that knocked down the overall tech-ownership numbers in some instances because respondents who wanted to be interviewed in Spanish were somewhat less likely than others to be tech non-users. This is part of a series of reports by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project exploring how different generations use technology (previous reports: 2010, 2009, 2006). All the generation labels used in these reports, with the exceptions of “Younger Boomers” and “Older Boomers,” are the names conventionalized by William Strauss and Neil Howe in their book, Generations: The History of America’s Future, 1584 to 2069 (Perennial, 1992). The Pew Internet Project’s “Generations” reports make the distinction between Younger Boomers and Older Boomers because enough research has been done to suggest that the two decades of Baby Boomers are different enough to merit being divided into distinct generational groups. The Pew Research Center recently published a series of reports that more closely examined the values, attitudes and experiences of the Millennial generation.1 These reports are available in full at pewresearch.org/millennials. Many of these reports also compare this younger generation to older cohorts. The primary adult data in this report come from a Pew Internet Project survey conducted from August 9-September 13, 2010, with some data from a survey conducted April 29 to May 30, 2010. For more information about these surveys, please see the Methodology section at the end of this report. Eighty-five percent of Americans age 18 and older own a cell phone, making it by far the most popular device among adults. Mobile phones are especially popular with adults under the age of 66, although the largest drop-off is for adults in the oldest generation (those age 75 and older), of whom 48% own a cell phone. When asked further about the presence of mobile phones in their households, one-third (33%) of those who do not own a cell phone live in a household with at least one working mobile phone. This means that overall, 90% of all adults—including 62% of those age 75 and older—live in a household with at least one working cell phone. As the proportion of households with at least one working cell phone rises, many are doing without a landline phone connection at all. In the first half of 2010, roughly one in four (25%) American adults lived in households that were “wireless only” in that they had at least one cell phone, but no landline. This includes more than half (51%) of young adults ages 25-29.2 Though cell phones are now ubiquitous in American homes, the level of engagement with the phones does vary widely between generations. As shown in the above table, our May 2010 survey found that while roughly the same proportion of adults in the Millennial generation and Generation X own cell phones, Millennials are significantly more likely to use their phones for a variety of purposes. A majority of Millennials use their phones for taking photos, texting, going online, sending email, playing games, listening to music, and recording videos—making them significantly more likely than any other generation to engage in all of these activities. In fact, the only two activities that are widely popular for all cell phone owners are taking pictures and sending text messages. Taking pictures is the most popular function on Americans’ phones, with more than half of all cell phone owners under the age of 75 using their phones for this purpose (only 16% of adults age 75 and older take photos with their phones). Text messaging, though also widely adopted, is less popular with adults over age 56. Click here for a larger verison As noted in previous reports, desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006, as laptops have gained in popularity.3 Currently 59% of all adults own a desktop computer, and 52% own a laptop (76% own a computer overall). Millennials are the only generation that is more likely to own a laptop or netbook (70%) than a desktop computer (57%). While 69% of adults in Generation X own a desktop, a close 61% own a laptop. While roughly six in ten adults ages 47-65 own a desktop, only 49% of Younger Boomers and 43% of Older Boomers own a laptop. Only 45% of adults over age 65 have a computer of any kind (40% of adults in that age group use the internet), and they are increasingly likely to use a desktop: 28% of adults age 75 and older use a desktop, and 10% use a laptop.4 Almost half—47%—of adults own an iPod or other mp3 player. However, among the devices examined in this report, mp3 players saw the widest range in ownership rates between generations. While 74% of Millennials own an mp3 player, only 56% of members of Gen X do—and adoption rates continue to drop for each of the older generations. Only 3% of adults age 75 and older own this type of device. Overall, 42% percent of all adults age 18 and older own a game console, and it is especially popular with members of the Millennial Generation and Generation X. Sixty-three percent of all adults ages 18-46 own a game console like an Xbox or Play Station, as well as 38% of those ages 47-56. Ownership rates continue to drop off, to 19% of Older Boomers (ages 56-64), 8% of the Silent Generation (ages 66-74), and only 3% of the G.I. Generation (age 75 and older). Additionally, as previously reported in “Americans and Their Gadgets,” parents with children living at home are nearly twice as likely as non-parents to own a game console—64% of parents own one, vs 33% of non-parents.5 As of September 2010, 5% of American adults own an electronic book reader such as a Kindle or Sony Digital Book, up from 2% of adults the first time the question was asked in April 2009. Statistically, there is very little variation between the different generations, although the G.I. Generation is slightly less likely than younger generations to own such a device. Though age is not a strong predictor of e-book use, our previous “Gadgets” report noted that ownership is more likely among college graduates and those with relatively high household incomes.6 Though there have been several incarnations of tablet-like computers over the years,7 they had not gained widespread attention until Apple introduced the iPad in early 2010.8 As of September 2010, 4% of American adults own a tablet computer such as an iPad. Though education and household income are high predictors for owning a tablet computer, as with e-book readers, they are also more popular with adults age 56 and under (who are significantly more likely to own a tablet computer than adults age 66 and older). In a previous May 2010 survey, when 3% of all adults said they owned a tablet computer, roughly six in ten of tablet owners said they use their device to access the internet. However, given the small number of tablet owners these findings are not reported in detail here.9 Click for a larger version","As noted in previous reports , desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006 , as laptops have gained in popularity.3 Currently 59 % of all adults own a desktop computer , and 52 % own a laptop ( 76 % own a computer overall ) .","Compare the number of desktop owners with laptop owners considering past years.","desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006 , as laptops have gained in popularity.3 Currently 59 % of all adults own a desktop computer , and 52 % own a laptop .","desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006 , as laptops have gained in popularity.3 Currently 59 % of all adults own a desktop computer , and 52 % own a laptop ."],"3366":["3366.png","Unequal Opportunity? Share agreeing that 'men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well, even when women are as qualified as men for the job' Germany 84% Poland 83 ","Among 38 of the world’s more developed nations, the United States has the least liberal government policies regarding paid parental leave, leading some to argue that this puts American women at a disadvantage as they navigate their careers. But it also turns out that some countries that offer more liberal parental leave policies have higher pay gaps among men and women ages 30 to 34, according to analyses of 16 countries conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. OECD theorizes that this link may be  driven by the fact that women are more likely than men to actually use their parental leave, and that time out of the workforce is associated with lower wages. The hourly pay gap in the U.S. is now 16%, according to a recent Pew Research Center report on gender and work – meaning that women today earn 84 cents for every $1 a man earns in an hour. This gap remains persistent, but has shrunk markedly from 36% in 1980. Using a slightly different metric, the OECD  found that the pay gap in the U.S. was about 18%, slightly higher than the median pay gap across 26 OECD states, which was about 14%. Countries with lower pay gaps include New Zealand and Belgium; these nations also provide little by way of paid time off for new parents. Countries with higher pay gaps include The Czech Republic and Austria, both of which offer new parents about 10 months of paid parental leave (this figure does not reflect unpaid leave, or paid maternity or paternity leave).  The U.S. has no national paid family leave policy, though a bill was recently introduced in Congress proposing one. (Some private U.S. employers offer paid leave.) But parental leave and gender differences in work experience are not the only factors associated with the gender pay gap. As is the case in the U.S., across these other 25 countries the gap increases with age, and with parenthood. As in the U.S., women in most of these countries have more education than men; this reduces the pay gap to some extent. It’s difficult to know the extent to which other factors may be driving the pay gap. What is clear is that among majorities in several developed nations, there is a perception that women are at a disadvantage when it comes to job opportunities. In 2010, Pew Research surveyed publics in a number of countries, seven of which are also represented in this pay gap data, about whether “men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well, even when women are as qualified as men for the job.”  Majorities in all seven countries agreed with the statement.  Agreement ranged from about seven-in-ten in the U.S. and Spain (68%), and up to more than eight-in-ten in Poland (83%) and Germany (84%).","In 2010 , Pew Research surveyed publics in a number of countries , seven of which are also represented in this pay gap data , about whether “ men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well , even when women are as qualified as men for the job . ”   Majorities in all seven countries agreed with the statement .

The Democratic coalition is largely united in staunch opposition to President Trump. Yet, while Trump’s election has triggered a wave of political activism within the party’s sizable liberal bloc, the liberals’ sky-high political energy is not nearly as evident among other segments in the Democratic base. And Democrats also are internally divided over U.S. global involvement, as well as some religious and social issues. These are among the findings of Pew Research Center’s new political typology, which sorts Americans into cohesive groups based on their values, attitudes and party affiliation, and provides a unique perspective on the nation’s changing political landscape. Before reading further, take our quiz to see where you fit in the political typology. The political typology reveals that even in a political landscape increasingly fractured by partisanship, the divisions within the Republican and Democratic coalitions may be as important a factor in American politics as the divisions between them. In some cases these fissures are not new – they were evident in six previous Pew Research Center typology studies conducted over the past three decades, most recently in 2014. Yet, especially within the GOP, many of the divisions now center on the issues that have been front-and-center for Trump since he first launched his presidential campaign. This study is based on surveys of more than 5,000 adults conducted over the summer. This was also the data source for our Oct. 6 report, “The Partisan Divide on Political Values Grows Even Wider.” These reports were made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which received support for the surveys from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The political typology finds two distinctly different groups on the right – Core Conservatives and Country First Conservatives, who both overwhelmingly approve of Trump, but disagree on much else – including immigration and whether it benefits the U.S. to be active internationally. Core Conservatives, who are in many ways the most traditional group of Republicans, have an outsized influence on the GOP coalition; while they make up just 13% of the public – and about a third (31%) of all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – they constitute a much larger share (43%) of politically engaged Republicans. This financially comfortable, male-dominated group overwhelmingly supports smaller government, lower corporate tax rates and believes in the fairness of the nation’s economic system. And a large majority of Core Conservatives (68%) express a positive view of U.S. involvement in the global economy “because it provides the U.S. with new markets and opportunities for growth.” Country First Conservatives, a much smaller segment of the GOP base, are older and less educated than other Republican-leaning typology groups. Unlike Core Conservatives, Country First Conservatives are unhappy with the nation’s course, highly critical of immigrants and deeply wary of U.S. global involvement. Nearly two-thirds of Country First Conservatives (64%) – the highest share of any typology group, right or left – say that “if America is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.” A third Republican group, Market Skeptic Republicans, sharply diverges from the GOP’s traditional support for business and lower taxes. Only about a third of Market Skeptic Republicans (34%) say banks and other financial institutions have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, lowest among Republican-leaning typology groups. Alone among the groups in the GOP coalition, a majority of Market Skeptic Republicans support raising tax rates on corporations and large businesses. An overwhelming share (94%) say the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests, which places the view of Market Skeptic Republicans on this issue much closer to Solid Liberals (99% mostly unfair) than Core Conservatives (21%). In contrast to Market Skeptic Republicans, New Era Enterprisers are fundamentally optimistic about the state of the nation and its future. They are more likely than any other typology group to say the next generation of Americans will have it better than people today. Younger and somewhat less overwhelmingly white than the other GOP-leaning groups, New Era Enterprisers are strongly pro-business and generally think that immigrants strengthen, rather than burden, the country. The four groups in the Democratic coalition differ on a number of issues: While they all strongly support the social safety net, the Democratic-leaning groups are divided on government regulation of business, and government performance more generally. And like the GOP coalition, they disagree on U.S. global involvement. While there have long been racial, ethnic and income differences within the Democratic coalition, these gaps are especially striking today. Reflecting the changing demographic composition of the Democratic base, for the first time there are two majority-minority Democratic-leaning typology groups, along with two more affluent, mostly white groups. Solid Liberals are the largest group in the Democratic coalition, and they make up close to half (48%) of politically engaged Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Largely white, financially comfortable and highly educated (most are college graduates and nearly a third have postgraduate degrees), Solid Liberals overwhelmingly express liberal attitudes on virtually every issue. And their level of political activism in the months following Trump’s election sets Solid Liberals apart from all other groups in the political typology, left or right. Nearly half of Solid Liberals (49%) say they have contributed money to a political candidate or campaign in the past year; no more than a third in any other group (32% of Core Conservatives) say the same. And 39% of Solid Liberals report they have participated in a protest against Trump’s policies, which also is by far the highest share among the political typology groups. For the most part, Opportunity Democrats agree with Solid Liberals on major issues. But Opportunity Democrats are less affluent, less politically engaged and less liberal – both in their attitudes on issues and in how they describe themselves politically. One area of difference between Opportunity Democrats and Solid Liberals is on corporate profits: 40% of Opportunity Democrats say most corporations make a “fair and reasonable amount of profit,” compared with 16% of Solid Liberals. And Opportunity Democrats stand out in their belief that most people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard. Disaffected Democrats have very positive feelings toward the Democratic Party and its leading figures. Their disaffection stems from their cynicism about politics, government and the way things are going in the country. This financially stressed, majority-minority group supports activist government and the social safety net, but most say government is “wasteful and inefficient.” A large majority of Disaffected Democrats say their side has been losing in politics, while fewer than half believe that voting gives them a say in how the government runs things. A second majority-minority group, Devout and Diverse, faces even tougher financial hardships than Disaffected Democrats. Devout and Diverse also are the most politically mixed typology group (about a quarter lean Republican), as well as the least politically engaged. Like Disaffected Democrats, they are critical of government regulation of business. They also are the most religiously observant Democratic-leaning group, and the only one in which a majority (64%) says it is necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values. In addition to the eight main groups in the political typology, a ninth group – the Bystanders – is missing in action politically. Almost no one in this relatively young, largely minority group is registered to vote and most pay little or no attention to politics and government. While both parties are divided internally, partisanship remains a defining feature of American political life. Across the eight main typology groups, majorities either affiliate with or lean toward either the Republican or Democratic Party. The power of partisanship is reflected in attitudes about Donald Trump. In the survey, conducted in June, Trump’s job ratings are more deeply polarized along partisan lines than those of any president in more than 60 years. Overall, Trump gets his most positive ratings among the two most solidly Republican groups, Core Conservatives and Country First Conservatives. Large majorities in each group strongly approve of Trump’s job performance (80% of Core Conservatives, 71% of Country First Conservatives). By contrast, more than 70% in the three overwhelmingly Democratic groups (Solid Liberals, Opportunity Democrats and Disaffected Democrats) strongly disapprove. However, even the Republican-leaning groups who strongly approve of Trump’s job performance are not all that positive about his conduct as president. Among the public overall, 58% say they don’t like Trump’s conduct, while just 16% like his conduct; 25% say they have mixed feelings. There is no typology group in which a clear majority expresses positive views of Trump’s conduct. About half of Country First Conservatives (51%) like Trump’s conduct as president, while 39% have mixed feelings. And among Core Conservatives, who strongly approve of Trump’s job performance, only 41% like his conduct and 51% have mixed feelings. The other GOP-leaning groups are divided in views of Trump’s conduct. About half of Market Skeptic Republicans (49%) say they have mixed feelings, while roughly equal shares say they like (24%) and don’t like (26%) his conduct. And among New Era Enterprisers, more express negative (39%) than positive (23%) views of Trump’s conduct, with 38% expressing mixed feelings. Among Democratic-leaning groups, overwhelming majorities of Solid Liberals (98%), Opportunity Democrats (86%) and Disaffected Democrats (89%) say they don’t like Trump’s conduct in office. As with Trump’s job approval, Devout and Diverse offer less critical views of Trump’s conduct, though far more express negative (52%) than positive views (10%). The two largest groups in the political typology – Core Conservatives on the right and Solid Liberals on the left – make up an even larger share of their partisan coalitions when political engagement is factored in. Core Conservatives are more likely than other GOP-leaning groups to say they follow politics and government most of the time and say they always vote. Consequently, while Core Conservatives make up about a third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents overall (31%), they constitute a larger proportion of politically engaged Republicans (43%). At the other end of the political typology, Solid Liberals constitute by far the largest proportion of politically engaged Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Solid Liberals make up a third of all Democrats and Democratic leaners – but close to half (48%) of politically engaged Democrats. That is about the same proportion as the other Democratic-leaning groups combined. The next largest group, Disaffected Democrats, make up 23% of Democrats and about the same share of politically engaged Democrats (20%); similarly, Opportunity Democrats constitute 20% of all Democrats and an identical share of politically engaged Democrats. And Devout and Diverse, who express very low levels of interest in politics and government, make up a substantially smaller share of politically engaged Democrats (7%) than of all Democrats (11%). The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away, but the two groups at either end of the political typology are already highly motivated by the battle for congressional control. More than eight-in-ten Solid Liberals (84%) say it matters a great deal to them which party wins control of Congress next year, the highest share of any typology group. Core Conservatives are next highest, at 77%. At this point, other groups are less engaged by the struggle for partisan control of Congress. And the drop-off is particularly notable among three groups close to the middle of the typology. On the right, fewer than half of Market Skeptic Republicans (44%) and New Era Enterprisers (41%) say it matters a great deal which party wins control of Congress; on the left, just 44% of Devout and Diverse say the same. The political typology sorts Americans into cohesive, like-minded groups based on their values and beliefs, as well as their partisan affiliation. The current study, which comes 30 years after the first political typology, is based on surveys conducted June 8-18 among 2,504 adults and June 27-July 9 among 2,505 adults, with a follow-up survey conducted Aug. 15-21 among 1,893 respondents. The typology is not intended to measure changes over time in the electorate, but some of the internal party differences that were evident 30 years ago still persist today. For example, Core Conservatives are far more likely than Country First Conservatives to favor societal acceptance of homosexuality. In 1987, two roughly parallel groups – Enterprise Republicans and Moral Republicans – differed over a disputed social policy at that time, whether or not school boards should have the right to fire homosexual teachers. There also have been long-standing divisions among Democratic groups over religion and morality. Today’s Solid Liberals, who overwhelmingly say that belief in God is not necessary to be moral, bear some resemblance to the Seculars and ’60s Democrats from that earlier era. Today’s Disaffected Democrats and Devout and Diverse – majority-minority groups who are much more likely than Solid Liberals to link belief in God with morality – are somewhat similar to the Partisan Poor and Passive Poor of three decades ago. To be sure, there have been seismic changes in the nation and politics over the past three decades – and these are reflected in the political typology. The country has become far more racially and ethnically diverse. In 1987, both parties were overwhelmingly white and non-Hispanic; today, only the GOP is, while more than 40% of Democrats are nonwhite. Thirty years ago, one of the largest groups in the political typology were the New Dealers, an older, mostly white, mostly Democratic group who were relatively conservative on social issues but favored activist government. There is no equivalent group in today’s political typology. There have been more recent changes as well, particularly in the GOP coalition. The two conservative Republican groups are divided over immigration, “openness” and America’s role in the world, as well as homosexuality. And for the first time, there is a Republican-leaning group that is deeply skeptical of business and the fundamental fairness of the nation’s economic system. On these issues, Market Skeptic Republicans have less in common with the other groups on the right than they do with the Democratic-leaning groups in the political typology.","The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away , but the two groups at either end of the political typology are already highly motivated by the battle for congressional control .

This was the highest share in at least four decades and represented a slow but steady increase over the 32% of their same-aged counterparts who were living at home prior to the Great Recession in 2007. There is a gender gap within that overall number, according to the study. Millennial males (40%) were more likely to live at home than Millennial females (32%). That 8 percentage point difference is smaller than the 11-point gap that existed in 1968. The growing gender parity in likelihood of residing at home is especially pronounced among 18- to 24-year-olds: 60% of men and 52% of women in that age group lived at home in 2012, an 8-percentage-point gap. In 1968, 59% of male 18- to 24-year-olds, but only 42% of females lived at home: a difference of 17 percentage points. One factor that has contributed to the growing gender parity in living at home is the rise in the share of young women who go to college. (In the Census data used for our analysis, college students who live in dormitories during the academic year are counted as living with their parents.) In 1968, only 19.5% of 18- to 24-year-old females were enrolled in college, compared with 34% of their male peers. That ratio has flipped; as of 2011, 44% of women and 38% of men ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in college, a 6-percentage-point advantage for women.","A Pew Research Center analysis of government data published earlier this month found that 36 % of the nation ’s young adults ages 18 to 31 — the so - called Millennial generation — were living in their parents ’ home in 2012 .

Nearly two-in-ten (17%) say they followed the controversy over the pastor’s announcement that he would burn Korans on Sept. 11 more closely than any other major story. The burning did not happen, but the story ranked second on the list of stories followed most closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey of 1001 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Another 9% say they followed news about the Sept. 11 anniversary most closely. The media devoted 15% of the newshole last week to news dealing with anti-Muslim sentiments. Most of that (14%) focused on Pastor Terry Jones’ plans and the push to get him to cancel the Koran burning, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). An additional 4% of coverage focused on the continuing debate over a planned Muslim community center and mosque near the site of the World Trade Center towers in downtown Manhattan. Despite the attention to religious controversies, Americans say they followed news about the major oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico – now stopped – more closely than other major news stories (27%). News about the spill, however, was limited (2% of the newshole). With coverage now focused on blame for the spill and its uncertain environmental impact, the public’s continued interest likely also reflects the story’s perceived importance. Following the April 20 oil rig explosion in the gulf that left 11 dead, interest in the story grew and stayed high as the massive scale of the spill became clear and repeated efforts to stem the flow of oil failed. The story dominated the public’s interest for weeks. By mid-July, BP was able to put a temporary cap in place. At that point, 48% said they were hearing a mix of good and bad news about the spill, 31% said they were hearing mostly bad news and 18% said they were hearing mostly good news. Two months later, most Americans (58%) say they have been hearing a mix of good and bad news about the oil spill, up from 47% when the question was last asked Aug. 5-8. Fewer say they are hearing mostly bad news (19%) than in early August (25%), though the proportion hearing mostly good news is also down (from 25% to 17%). More Americans (37%) say that press coverage of Barack Obama has been fair than say it has been too easy (27%) or too tough (23%). Those numbers are largely unchanged from July or April. Not surprisingly, partisans have starkly different views on this question. About four-in-ten Democrats (41%) say coverage has been too tough, about the same as the 42% that said this in July, but up from 31% in April. Just 6% of Republicans say coverage of the Democratic president has been too tough. Half of Republicans say coverage has been too easy, not much different from the 55% that said this in July or the 57% that did so in April. Just 12% of Democrats say press coverage of Obama has been too easy. Independents largely mirror the general public. Four-in-ten say coverage of Obama has been fair, 28% say it has been too easy and 19% say it has been too tough. Opinions about coverage of Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress also are little changed since mid-July. Currently, 40% say the press has been fair in coverage of GOP leaders, 24% say it has been too easy and 16% say it has been too tough. Just more than four-in-ten (43%) say press coverage of Democratic leaders has been fair, 26% say too easy and 12% say too tough. Partisan views of coverage of party leaders are also little changed. Nearly half of Republicans (47%) say coverage of Democratic leaders is too easy, 6% say too tough and 34% say fair. Most Democrats see coverage of Democratic leaders as fair (55%); 7% see it as too easy and 22% see it as too tough. More than four-in-ten Democrats (44%) see coverage of Republican leaders in Congress as fair, 29% see it as too easy and 9% see it as too tough. Among Republicans, 35% see coverage as fair, a comparable 33% see it as too tough and 15% see it as too easy. Independents largely reflect the public as a whole. Americans paid close attention last week to three story lines with links to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. In addition to interest in the possible Koran burning (33% very closely), the public also very closely tracked news about developments in Afghanistan (30%) and Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations (33%). One-in-ten say they followed news about the current situation and events in Afghanistan most closely last week, while news about the war there accounted for 3% of coverage, according to PEJ. Nearly as many (9%) say they followed news about the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks most closely. News about commemorations made up 2% of coverage. More than two-in-ten (22%) say they followed news about this year’s congressional elections very closely. This was the most closely followed news for 8% and accounted for 12% of coverage. Some 16% say they followed the debate in Washington over competing Democratic and Republican tax plans very closely; 3% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the tax plans made up 4% of coverage. In its overall analysis, PEJ included news about the tax debate with news about the economic crisis in general, a topic that accounted for 17% of coverage last week. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected September 6-12, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected September 9-12, from a nationally representative sample of 1,001 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Thursday through Sunday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for this survey are based on telephone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a national sample of 1,001 adults living in the continental United States, 18 years of age or older, from September 9-12, 2010 (671 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 330 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 130 who had no landline telephone). Both the landline and cell phone samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample is also weighted to match current patterns of telephone status based on extrapolations from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","Americans paid close attention last week to three story lines with links to the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 .

And today, just 34% approve of Trump’s overall job performance, while 59% disapprove. However, Trump’s job approval rating is higher than those of Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. Just 22% approve of the way Republican congressional leaders are doing their jobs, down 12 percentage points since February. Job ratings for Democratic leaders are not quite as negative (29% approve), though also are lower than in February (37%). The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Oct. 25-30 among 1,504 adults, finds that Trump’s job rating is lower than it was in June and February (39% on each occasion). Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president, with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving (51% to 25%). Trump engenders less confidence in handling various aspects of his job than he did in April. As he prepares for his first presidential visit to Asia, 39% say they are very or somewhat confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, down from 48% six months ago. Six-in-ten say they are not too confident (14%) or not at all confident (45%) in Trump to handle an international crisis. The share expressing no confidence in Trump to handle an overseas crisis has increased seven percentage points (from 38%) since April. A similar pattern is seen in public confidence in Trump to manage the executive branch effectively and to work well with Congress. And just 39% say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump’s ability to handle the situation with North Korea; 13% not too confident and 46% are not at all confident in Trump in dealing with North Korea. Since earlier this year, approval ratings for the congressional leaders of both parties have fallen – largely because fewer Republicans and Democrats are expressing positive views of their own parties’ leaders. In February, 34% of Americans, including 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, said they approved of the way GOP leaders in Congress were handling their jobs. Today, Republican leaders’ overall job approval has declined to 22%, with just 39% of Republicans approving of their job performance. Since February, job ratings for Democratic congressional leaders have fallen eight percentage points overall (from 37% to 29%); just 44% of Democrats and Democratic leaners approve of their party’s congressional leaners, down from 58% eight months ago. As Congress begins debate over taxes, the public expresses more confidence in Democratic congressional leaders than Republican leaders or President Trump to make wise decisions about tax policy. Overall, 50% say they are very or somewhat confident in Democratic leaders to make wise decisions about tax policy; 42% are very or somewhat confident in GOP leaders and 40% have the same level of confidence in Trump. As with his overall job rating, Trump engenders strong feelings on taxes: 42% are “not at all confident” that he can make wise decisions on taxes, which is much higher than the shares expressing no confidence in Republican leaders (31%) or Democratic leaders (24%). On the other hand, far more say they are “very confident” in Trump (22%) than say that about GOP leaders (9%) or Democratic leaders (11%). With the GOP’s tax proposal still taking shape, the public is divided on whether lowering taxes for corporations and large businesses would help (36%) or hurt (also 36%) the economy, with 25% saying it would not make a difference. However, far more Americans say lowering taxes for corporations would make the tax system less fair (44%) than make it more fair (25%); 27% say this would not make a difference. The new survey finds that public concerns about the nation’s budget deficit are lower today than during Barack Obama’s presidency. About half of Americans (54%) view the deficit as a “very serious” problem for the country, while 35% regard it as a “somewhat serious” problem. Very few, just 10%, think it is not much of a problem. In 2010 and 2011, close to 70% or more viewed the deficit as a very serious problem. In both parties, fewer say the deficit is a major problem than did so then. About half of Democrats (46%) now view the deficit as a very serious problem, down from 64% in late 2010. Over the same period, there has been a 25-percentage point decline in the share of Republicans saying the deficit is a very serious problem for the country (85% then, 60% now). The Democratic Party now holds a slight edge over the GOP on taxes and advantages on several other issues. Currently, 43% say the Democrats can better deal with taxes, while 36% prefer the Republican Party. In April, the two parties ran about even on taxes. The survey, which was completed before the Oct. 31 terrorist attack in New York City, finds that the public is divided over which party can do a better job of dealing with the terrorist threat in the U.S. (38% say the Democratic Party, while 37% say the Republican Party); another 12% volunteer that neither party could do better, while 9% say both could do about equally well. In recent years, the Republican Party has held a sizable lead on handling terrorism. In April, 48% preferred the Republicans, while 36% said the Democrats could do better. The two parties also run about even on several other major issues, including the budget deficit, the economy, trade and gun policy. As in the past, Democrats hold substantial advantages on the environment, health care and abortion. Most Republicans say Trump represents core GOP principles. Currently, 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump represents “the core principles and positions the Republican Party should stand for.” There has been very little change in these views over the past year. Last October, shortly before the election, 65% of Republican voters said Trump represented core Republican principles. Democrats more likely than Republicans to say their party is united. A majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (56%) say their party is “mostly united,” which is little changed from April. By contrast, just 35% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the same about their party; six months ago, 42% of Republicans said their party was mostly united. Few expect progress on reducing deficit. The public is pessimistic that progress will be achieved in reducing the deficit. Currently, just 30% expect the nation to make “significant progress” in reducing the federal budget deficit over the next five years. In December 2012, somewhat more (44%) thought progress would be made in lowering the budget deficit. Overall, 34% say they approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president; a 59% majority disapprove of his job performance. Across most demographic groups, more say they disapprove than approve of Trump. Still, there are differences in these assessments by age, race and education. Overwhelming majorities of black (87%) and Hispanic (72%) Americans say they disapprove of Trump’s job performance. Among whites, 51% disapprove, while 43% approve. Majorities across all age categories disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Adults who are 50 and older (38%) are more likely to approve of Trump than those under 50 (30%). By more than two-to-one, those with postgraduate degrees (71% vs. 26%) and four-year college degrees (65% vs. 29%) are more likely to disapprove than approve of Trump. Smaller majorities of those with some college education (57%) or no more than a high school degree (55%) disapprove as well. White evangelical Protestants widely express approval of Trump: 67% approve, while just 27% disapprove. By contrast, a 58% majority of white mainline Protestants disapprove of Trump’s job performance, as do 59% of Catholics and 66% of those who are religiously unaffiliated. Public assessments of Donald Trump’s ability to handle several aspects of his job are more negative today than they were earlier in his term. Overall, 39% of the public is very or somewhat confident that Donald Trump can work effectively with Congress, while 59% are not too or not at all confident Trump can do this. In April, 46% expressed confidence in Trump’s ability to work with Congress. Trump receives similar ratings on his ability to manage the executive branch: 42% say they are at least somewhat confident that he can do this effectively. Last spring, half (50%) had confidence in Trump’s ability in this area. Today, 39% say they are very or somewhat confident in Trump’s ability to handle an international crisis, while 60% say they have little or no confidence. In April, 48% expressed at least some confidence in him in this area, while 51% said they had little or no confidence. Asked specifically about Trump’s ability to handle the situation with North Korea, more say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump (59%) than say they are at least somewhat confident (39%) in his ability to handle this issue. Confidence in Trump across issues has moved lower among both Republicans and Democrats, though Republicans continue to express largely positive assessments of Trump’s ability. Today, 73% of Republicans and Republican leaners are very or somewhat confident in Trump’s ability to work effectively with Congress, down somewhat from 79% in April. Similarly, 80% of Republicans are confident Trump can handle an international crisis; 85% said this in April. There has been no significant decline in Republican confidence in Trump to manage the executive branch effectively (83% say this today vs. 84% in April). The share of Republicans who express confidence in Trump to handle the situation with North Korea (80%) is comparable to the ratings he receives from Republicans on other issues (the item on North Korea was not asked in April). Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, very few have confidence in Trump’s ability across issue areas. Just 15% of Democrats today say they are confident Trump can work effectively with Congress, down from 24% in April. There have also been declines in the already small shares of Democrats who have confidence in Trump to manage the executive branch effectively (12% today, 19% in April) or handle an international crisis (10% today, 15% in April). Just 9% of Democrats say they are very or somewhat confident that Trump can handle the situation with North Korea. Well into Trump’s first year in office, most Republicans see the Republican Party as divided in its views on issues and vision for the future: Nearly two-thirds (63%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say the GOP is mostly divided, compared with about a third (35%) who say the party is mostly united. In April, Republicans were somewhat more likely to see the GOP as united in its views and vision (42%), though a majority still saw the party as divided (57%). By contrast, Democrats continue to see the Democratic Party as mostly united in its views on issues and vision for the future: 56% say this, compared with 39% who say the party is mostly divided. These views are unchanged from April. Approval ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders remain negative on balance and are lower than they were in February. Today, 29% say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing, down from 37% in February. Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are even worse: just 22% say they approve of the job they are doing. Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are down from a recent high point of 34%, reached in February at the start of the 115th Congress. The recent drop in ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders is largely attributable to partisans’ increasingly negative assessments of their own party’s leaders. About four-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (39%) say they approve of the job GOP leaders in Congress are doing. These ratings down sharply from February – just after the start of the new GOP-controlled Congress and Trump’s inauguration – when 68% said they approved. However, current Republican ratings of their party are on par with views at other points over the last several years. The share of Democrats and Democratic leaners who say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing is also down significantly from the start of the year. In the current survey, just 44% of Democrats say they approve of their congressional leaders, down from 58% in February. Democratic ratings of their leaders are as low as they have been in any survey since 2011. On many issues – including dealing with the economy – the public remains divided over which party could do the better job. On other issues, including the environment, health care and abortion, the Democratic Party maintains long-held advantages over the Republican Party. And in a shift in public views, the Republican Party has lost ground on the issues of taxes and dealing with the terrorist threat at home. On many economic issues, neither party holds clear advantages and views are virtually unchanged from April. The public is split over which party could do a better job dealing with the economy, the federal budget deficit and trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries. On taxes, however, the Democratic Party currently has a slight advantage: 43% think the Democratic Party could do a better job on this issue, compared with 36% who say the Republican Party could do the better job. In April, public views were evenly divided. The share who thinks the GOP could do better on taxes has declined from earlier this year, while the share that prefers the Democratic Party is little changed (more now volunteer that they don’t know who would do better or say both parties or neither party could handle the issue). Today, 65% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the GOP could do better on taxes than the Democratic Party, down from 82% in April. The Republican Party also has lost ground on dealing with the terrorist threat at home – an issue where they have long held an advantage over the Democratic Party. About as many now say the Democratic Party (38%) as Republican Party (37%) could do the better job on the issue. In April, by 48% to 36% more said they preferred the Republican Party’s approach. As was the case in April, the public sees the Democratic Party as better than the GOP when it comes to “making wise decisions about foreign policy.” The Democratic Party maintains a slight edge as the party seen as better able to deal with immigration. As in the past, the Democratic Party continues to hold advantages on the issues of health care, abortion and the environment. By 50% to 32%, more say the Democratic Party is better able to deal with health care. When it comes to policies on abortion and contraception, the Democratic Party holds a 14-percentage-point advantage over the Republican Party (47% vs. 33%). By a wide 23-percentage-point margin, more say the Democratic Party (52%) than Republican Party (29%) could do the better job dealing with the environment. Views on which party could better handle gun policy have fluctuated in recent years. Neither party has held a significant advantage in surveys conducted in April and October of this year. About six-in-ten American (58%) now say the current federal tax system is either not too fair (32%) or not at all fair (26%). Significantly fewer (41%) describe the tax system as very fair (3%) or moderately fair (38%). Views on the fairness of the tax system have changed little since April, but a greater share of the public now perceives the system as unfair than said this late in the Obama administration. In February 2015, about as many described the federal tax system as very or moderately fair (50%) as said it was not too or not at all fair (48%). Republicans and Democrats hold similar views about the overall fairness of the tax system. Roughly four-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (43%) and Democrats and Democratic leaners (41%) describe the present system as very or moderately fair. Majorities of both groups say it is not too or not at all fair. Partisan views of the fairness of the tax system have fluctuated in the last few decades, with Republicans and Democrats often holding different views. In 2015, Democrats (56%) were much more likely than Republicans (44%) to describe the tax system as at least moderately fair. By contrast, in December of 2011, a greater share of Republicans (49%) than Democrats (40%) described the system as fair. The public holds mixed views of how lowering taxes for large businesses and corporations would impact the economy; at the same time, more say these cuts would make the tax system less fair rather than more fair. Overall, 36% say lowering taxes for large businesses and corporations would help the economy, while an identical share (36%) say it would hurt the economy; 25% don’t think it would make much difference. Views on how these cuts would impact the fairness of the tax system tilt more negative: 44% say lowering taxes for large businesses and corporations would make the tax system less fair, compared with 25% who say it would make the system more fair and 27% who don’t think it would make much difference. There are wide partisan divides in views of the impact of corporate tax cuts. Six-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (60%) think lower tax rates for businesses and corporations would lead to economic growth. By contrast, 51% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think these changes would hurt the economy (just 19% think they would help). When it comes to the fairness of the tax system, 61% of Democrats (including 78% of liberal Democrats) say lowering taxes on businesses and corporations would make the tax system less fair. Views among Republicans are more mixed: 38% say these tax cuts would make the system more fair, compared with 35% who say they wouldn’t make much difference and just 23% who say they would make the system less fair. Those with higher family incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to say lowering taxes on businesses and corporations would improve the economy. For example, 50% of those in households earning $150,000 a year or more think corporate tax cuts would help the economy, compared with just 27% of those earning $30,000 a year or less. Differences in views across income levels are more modest when it comes to the impact these tax cuts would have on the fairness of the tax system: Pluralities across most income groups say lowering taxes for large businesses and corporations would make the system less fair. Income differences in views of the impact of lowering taxes for businesses and corporations are evident within both parties. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a wide majority of those with household incomes of $75,000 a year or more (73%) think lowering taxes on corporations and large businesses would help the economy. By comparison, 42% of Republicans in households making $30,000 a year or less think lower taxes for large businesses and corporations would help the economy. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, the income pattern in views is the reverse: Those with higher incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to say tax cuts for large businesses and corporations would hurt the economy. About six-in-ten Democrats with incomes of $75,000 a year or more (61%) think lowering taxes on corporations would hurt the economy, compared with 44% of those earning $30,000 a year or less. While Democrats overall think lower taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system less fair, this view is more widely held among those earning $75,000 a year or more (76%) and those earning between $30,000 and $74,999 (61%) than among those with household incomes of less than $30,000 (45%). Among Republicans, those with incomes of $75,000 a year or above are more likely to say lowering taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system more fair (43%) than less fair (17%). Views of how lowering taxes on large businesses and corporations would impact the economy are strongly associated with views of whether a decrease in corporate taxes would make the system more or less fair. Fully 73% of those who say lowering taxes would hurt the economy also say it would make the system less fair. Among those who say a decrease in corporate taxes would help the economy, about half (49%) say it would make the system more fair, while 30% say it would not have an impact on the system’s fairness and just 18% say it would make the system less fair. Overall, 40% of Americans are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make wise decisions about tax policy and roughly as many (42%) are very or somewhat confident in Republican congressional leaders. Half of the public (50%) is at least somewhat confident in Democratic congressional leaders on this issue. Yet the share who says they are very confident in Donald Trump (22%) is substantially higher than the shares saying this for either Republican leaders (9%) or Democratic leaders (11%) in Congress. But the public is also more likely to say they are “not at all confident” in Trump’s decision making on tax policy (42%) than to say this about either party’s leaders in Congress (31% say this about GOP leaders, 24% about Democratic leaders). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, larger shares express confidence in Trump than Republican leaders in Congress: 81% say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump, including 52% who say they are very confident him. By comparison, 73% are at least somewhat confident in the party’s leaders in Congress, though just 20% say they are very confident in GOP congressional leaders. Democrats and Democratic leaners express roughly the same level of confidence in their party’s congressional leadership on this issue as Republicans do in GOP leadership: About three-quarters (74%) of Democrats are very or somewhat confident in Democratic leaders in Congress, including 19% who are very confident. Both parties express low levels of confidence in the opposing party’s congressional leadership on tax policy. About three-quarters of Republicans (76%) say they are not too or not at all confident in Democratic congressional leadership, while the same share of Democrats (76%) says this about GOP leaders. Yet Democrats are even less likely to express confidence in Trump: 89% have little or no confidence in Trump to make wise decisions about tax policy, including two-thirds (67%) who say they are not at all confident in him on this issue. About half of Americans (54%) say the budget deficit is a very serious problem for the country right now; 35% say it is a somewhat serious problem, while 10% say it is a not too or not at all serious problem right now. While this is similar to public opinion on this question in CBS News/New York Times surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005, far greater shares of Americans said the budget deficit was a serious problem for the country in 2010 and 2011. For example, in June 2011, 75% said the deficit was a very serious problem. Concern about the deficit is lower than it was in 2010 and 2011 across the political spectrum. The share of Republicans, Democrats and independents saying the budget deficit is a very serious problem is down roughly 20 percentage points among each group from surveys conducted in those years. Republicans remain more likely than Democrats to say the deficit is a very serious problem: Today, 60% of Republicans, 57% of independents and 46% of Democrats say the deficit is a very serious problem. While a similar partisan gap was evident throughout 2010 and 2011, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to view the deficit as a serious problem for the country in surveys conducted from 2003 through 2004 (during the George W. Bush administration). Most Americans do not expect to see “significant progress reducing the federal budget deficit” over the next five years or so: 30% say significant progress will be made reducing the deficit, 66% say there will not be significant progress. Pessimism about making progress on the deficit is significantly higher than in surveys conducted from 2010 through 2012. In December 2012, 44% expected the country to make significant progress reducing the deficit in the following years. Democrats and Democratic leaners are much more pessimistic about progress on the deficit today than they were in 2012. Five years ago, 63% of Democrats thought there would be progress. Today just 18% of Democrats say this. Republicans and Republican leaners, however, are more optimistic today than five years ago: 48% now say we will make significant progress reducing the federal budget deficit in the next five years; just 22% said this five years ago.","The new national survey by Pew Research Center , conducted Oct. 25 - 30 among 1,504 adults , finds that Trump ’s job rating is lower than it was in June and February ( 39 % on each occasion ) . Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president , with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ) . Since earlier this year , approval ratings for the congressional leaders of both parties have fallen – largely because fewer Republicans and Democrats are expressing positive views of their own parties ’ leaders .","What are the feelings of Americans about the president?","Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president , with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ) .","Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president , with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ) ."],"7336":["7336.png","No Improvement in Public Perceptions of Economic News","In the days following BP’s latest—and apparently successful—effort to seal the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, public perceptions of news about the spill have become somewhat more positive. Only a quarter of Americans (25%) say they are hearing mostly good news about the oil spill, but that is more than double the percentage expressing this view two weeks ago (11%). The latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted August 5-8 among 1,002 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, finds that about half of the public (47%) says they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the oil spill in the Gulf, while 25% say they are hearing mostly bad news. The percentage saying they are hearing mixed news has fallen since late July (from 59%), while the proportion hearing mostly bad news has edged upward (from 18%). The Gulf coast oil leak continues to be the public’s most closely followed story, but interest has declined from last week. About four-in-ten (42%) say they followed the story very closely, down from 57% a week ago. Nevertheless, the Gulf oil leak was once again the public’s top news story: 42% say it is the story they followed most closely this week; news about the economy was a distant second, cited by just 16%. News coverage about the leak also has dropped off in recent weeks. The leak accounted for 11% of this week’s newshole according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). By comparison, the story dominated news coverage throughout June—constituting 44% of the newshole at its peak, the week ending June 20th. In contrast to views of news about the oil spill, the public’s perceptions of economic news have not changed and remain far more negative than positive. Currently, 55%say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about t he economy, while 38% say the economic news they are hearing is mostly bad and just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy. That is little changed from early July, when 54% said they were hearing mixed news, and 42% said they were hearing mostly bad news. In June, however, just 30% said they were hearing mostly bad news and 65% said the news was a mix of good and bad. As has been the case throughout the year, Republican perceptions of economic news are more negative than Democratic perceptions. Half of Republicans (50%) say they are hearing mostly negative news. Just 27% of Democrats and 37% of independents say this. Those who say they are following economic news very closely have similar impressions of the tenor of economic news as those who are following news about the economy less closely. Although the level of public interest in the oil leak is lower than it was earlier in the summer, the story continues to top the list of stories the public is following. Similarly, although the news media is no longer devoting as much coverage to the leak as in the past, it remains one of the top two stories covered by the press. News about the economy rivaled the oil leak in the amount of coverage this week, accounting for 12% of the newshole, and public interest in economic news remains high. Nearly four-in-ten (39%) say they are following economic news very closely; 16% say it is the news they followed most closely. As the scheduled end of the combat mission in Iraq approaches at the end of this month, about a quarter (23%) say they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, while just 8% say this is the story they followed most closely. The public’s attention to news about Iraq has not shifted much over the last year. According to PEJ, Iraq filled just 3% of this week’s newshole. A federal judge’s ruling that California’s ban on same sex-marriage is unconstitutional garnered 5% of news coverage this week, with 21% of the public reporting that they are following this story very closely and 7% naming it their top story. Both Republicans (27%) and Democrats (25%) were more likely than independents (17%) to say they followed news about the Proposition 8 ruling very closely. About one-in-five (19%) say they followed news about the planned mosque and Islamic cultural center near the site of the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan very closely, with 5% saying it was the story they followed most closely. News about the planned mosque, which accounted for just 2% of the newshole, was followed more closely by Republicans (27% very closely) than Democrats (16% very closely); 19% of independents say they followed the story very closely. Just 15% say they followed the Senate’s confirmation of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court very closely—about the same percentage (16%) who said they followed her confirmation hearings in July. Only 3% of press coverage was focused on Kagan. The confirmations of both Sonia Sotomayor last year and John Roberts in 2005 were more closely followed by the public (22% and 28%, respectively, said they followed those confirmations very closely). These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected August 2-8, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected August 5-8, from a nationally representative sample of 1,002 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for this survey are based on telephone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a national sample of 1,002 adults living in the continental United States, 18 years of age or older, from August 5-8, 2010 (671 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 331 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 131 who had no landline telephone). Both the landline and cell phone samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample is also weighted to match current patterns of telephone status based on extrapolations from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","In contrast to views of news about the oil spill , the public ’s perceptions of economic news have not changed and remain far more negative than positive .

This year’s survey finds negative reactions around much of the world to Donald Trump’s presidency, and major changes in ratings for the U.S. Here are nine charts that highlight international perceptions of Trump. 1Globally, Trump is much less popular than his predecessor. Across 37 countries we surveyed in spring 2017, a median of just 22% said they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. In contrast, 64% expressed confidence in President Barack Obama in these same 37 nations during the final years of his presidency. And this shift in American leadership has clearly had an impact on how the world sees the U.S.: A median of 49% now give the U.S. a favorable rating, down from 64% in the Obama era. 2Only a few countries have positive views of Trump. In just eight of the 37 nations in the study, roughly half or more say they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. The president gets his best reviews in the Philippines, where 69% express trust in him (although this is down from the 94% Obama registered in 2015). Trump also gets mostly positive ratings in sub-Saharan Africa, as did both Obama and former President George W. Bush. Russia, Israel and Vietnam also have confidence in Trump’s ability to handle international relations. 3Trump’s ratings in Western Europe look a lot like Bush’s at the end of his tenure. While Obama was very popular in Western Europe, his presidency was bookended by two very unpopular Republican presidents. Major elements of George W. Bush’s foreign policies met with widespread opposition in the region, and by the time he left office, his ratings in countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain were quite low. Today, Trump gets similar marks as Bush in these four nations. 4Europeans who favor right-wing parties are generally more likely to have confidence in Trump. Those with a favorable view of right-wing parties in France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany tend to express more confidence in Trump. For example, in France, 39% of people with a positive view of Marine Le Pen’s National Front party have confidence in the U.S. president, compared with just 6% among those who have an unfavorable opinion of the National Front. Still, even among those who like right-wing parties, confidence in Trump is limited, and there is no Western European country in which a majority of right-wing party supporters offer a positive assessment of the American president’s leadership in world affairs. 5Trump gets more negative ratings globally than Merkel, Xi or Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the only world leader included in the survey who receives more positive than negative reviews. Across the 37 nations polled, a median of 42% express confidence in her, while 31% say they lack confidence. Ratings for Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are mostly negative, and Trump receives even more unfavorable assessments than both of them. 6Global publics oppose some of Trump’s major policies. We tested five of Trump’s major national security and foreign policy proposals – withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, placing tighter restrictions on people entering the U.S. from certain majority-Muslim nations, pulling out of international climate change agreements, withdrawing from trade deals and building a wall on the Mexican border – and with a few exceptions, they meet with broad disapproval around the world. 7Most say Trump is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, but a majority also sees him as a strong leader. Survey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics and asked whether each one describes Trump. Around the globe, people tend to associate the American leader with all of the negative characteristics tested: Most say he is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, while relatively few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people. Describing Trump as charismatic is more common, though global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic, either. They do, however, see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55% across the nations polled describe him this way. 8Trump gets his lowest ratings in Mexico. Over the past decade, U.S. presidents have gotten mixed or negative reviews in Mexico, but at 5%, Trump registers the lowest confidence rating of any U.S. leader in Mexico since Pew Research Center began surveying there. His rating in Mexico is also the lowest among the 37 nations polled in 2017. The proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high-profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president, and more than nine-in-ten Mexicans oppose it. U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico, and that remains the case this year – though the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015. 9Russians give Trump higher marks than they gave Obama or Bush. Amid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. and its president have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russians’ ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 – the last time the Center polled in Russia – favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common, and Trump gets better reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.","Still , even among those who like right - wing parties , confidence in Trump is limited , and there is no Western European country in which a majority of right - wing party supporters offer a positive assessment of the American president ’s leadership in world affairs .

Bush is losing ground with the public in his efforts to build support for private retirement accounts in Social Security. Despite Bush’s intensive campaign to promote the idea, the percentage of Americans who say they favor private accounts has tumbled to 46% in Pew’s latest nationwide survey, down from 54% in December and 58% in September. Support has declined as the public has become increasingly aware of the president’s plan. More than four-in-ten (43%) say they have heard a lot about the proposal, nearly double the number who said that in December (23%). The new poll indicates that the Social Security debate is packing a powerful political punch. It finds that just 29% of Americans approve of the way that Bush is handling the issue. This is the president’s lowest approval rating for any policy area, and is considerably lower than his overall job approval rating of 46%. Moreover, by a 65%-25% margin, most say the president has not explained his Social Security proposal clearly enough. Further, the public expresses much more confidence on this issue in the AARP, which is strongly opposed to private accounts, than they do in the president or in Republican congressional leaders. However, Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, who has offered a qualified endorsement of Bush’s plan, also is widely trusted on Social Security. And while just 42% say they mostly trust Bush on Social Security, Democratic congressional leaders earn no more trust than the president (41%). The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Feb. 16-21 among 1,502 Americans, suggests that the public agrees with Bush that the Social Security system is facing funding problems. Two-thirds (67%) think that the Social Security program will run short of money in the future. Yet even among supporters of private retirement accounts, the proposal’s major appeal is not that it will make the program more financially secure. More than half of the supporters of private accounts (52%) say they favor the idea mainly because private accounts will give individuals greater control; just 20% support private accounts because they will make Social Security more financially stable. Among opponents of private accounts, nearly half (48%) worry about potentially risky investments. A significant number also cite the possibility that guaranteed benefits will have to be cut (28%). And 15% say the main reason for their opposition is that establishing private accounts will increase the federal budget deficit. Over the past two months, support for private retirement accounts has declined among most demographic and political groups. But the erosion has been especially steep among Hispanics (down 18 points since December), conservative and moderate Democrats (down 17 points), and people age 65 and older (15 points). Support among African Americans for private accounts also has slipped from 50% to 36%, despite Bush’s concerted efforts to promote his plan with blacks. The president finds the greatest support for his plan among his fellow Republicans (68% favor private accounts) and among people under 30 (66% favor). Opinion among these groups has remained relatively stable since December. The survey includes other findings that may portend trouble for private accounts. At this stage, opponents of the plan are more fixed in their attitudes than those who favor this option. A 68% majority of those who oppose the plan say they feel strongly and will not change their minds. In contrast, just 53% of backers are strongly in favor, with as many as 45% saying they could change their opinions and oppose private accounts. In terms of other possible Social Security changes, there is considerable public opposition to proposals that would raise the retirement age (72% opposed), reduce the rate of benefit growth (64%), and raise payroll taxes (56%). The only possible changes tested that win majority support are those aimed at wealthy Americans. Six-in-ten favor applying the payroll tax to all wages, which would scrap the current limit of $90,000; and 58% would limit Social Security benefits for wealthy Americans.","President George W.

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to more than two-thirds of the world’s people living with HIV, according to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. While Francis didn’t specifically refer to condom use, his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, once said that condoms can “increase the problem” of HIV and AIDS by encouraging promiscuity. Roman Catholic Church teaching rejects the use of artificial contraception on a moral basis. Several African nations stand out among the most conservative on the issue of contraceptive use, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of people in 40 countries. Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya and Senegal ranked among the nine countries with the most moral opposition to contraception. In Nigeria and Ghana, roughly half or more of each population said that contraceptive use is morally unacceptable (54% and 52%, respectively). Out of the 40 countries surveyed, only Pakistan (65%) had a higher rate of opposition. There is less moral objection to contraception in the other sub-Saharan African nations in the survey, but significant shares in Uganda (38%), Kenya (33%) and Senegal (28%) said contraceptive use is morally wrong. The comparable figure for the U.S. is 7%. South Africa, which has more people living with HIV/AIDS than any other nation, stands out in sub-Saharan Africa for its lower level of moral opposition to contraceptive use. Just 15% of South Africans said contraception is morally unacceptable, while fully two-thirds (68%) said it is morally acceptable. A study published in 2012 by the British Royal Society found that increased condom use was the “most significant factor” in slowing the spread of HIV in South Africa.

Even before the current political stalemate, Turks were split on whether the democratic system in their country was working, and positive views of Erdogan were at their lowest point since 2012. However, a majority of Turks still prefer a democratic form of government rather than a leader with a strong hand to guide their country. The internal divisions that are plaguing Turkey are clearly evident in a newly released Pew Research Center poll, which was conducted April to May 2015. According to the survey, \t\tthe country is split evenly down the middle in terms of the way its democracy is working – 49% are satisfied, while 49% are dissatisfied.  \t\t But members of President Erdogan’s electoral coalition are significantly more satisfied with the current state of democracy. This includes Turks who are older, less educated, those who support his Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Muslims who pray more than 5 times per day. Younger, more educated Turks, followers of the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) and less devout Muslims are more disillusioned. In addition to their mixed views on democracy, many Turks are dissatisfied with the direction of their country. Turks name rising prices, crime and inequality as the problems they worry about most. And as far as trust in national institutions, the military is the only one that Turks say has a good influence on the country. Views of the police, national government, religious leaders and the courts are mixed, while views of the media tilt to the negative. Additionally, 52% of Turks think their children will be worse off financially in the future. With the war in Syria and Iraq intensifying on the Turkish border, \t\t67% of Turks say that fewer refugees should be allowed into the country.  \t\t And when this survey was conducted in the spring, only 36% wanted to join the anti-ISIS coalition. Since then, the Turkish government has officially joined the U.S.-led campaign. In terms of foreign relations, Turks on balance still have \t\tnegative opinions of every major world power tested, including the U.S. (58% unfavorable), NATO (50%) and the European Union (49%).  \t\t Still, a majority in Turkey (55%) favor joining the EU, a figure that has not changed much in the last five years. And 54% say that Turkey should be more respected around the world than it currently is. These are among the main findings of a recent Pew Research Center survey conducted April 5 to May 15, 2015 among 947 respondents in Turkey. The survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews before the June parliamentary elections and ensuing political stalemate, as well as before the recent escalation in military operations on the border against both Islamic State and Kurdish PKK militants, and the suicide bombing in Ankara just this past week. Turks are generally dissatisfied with the state of their country. \t\tJust over half (54%) are dissatisfied with the way things are going in Turkey, while 44% are satisfied.  \t\t Dissatisfaction has grown since 2013, when 48% were unhappy with the state of the nation. However, it is important to note that from 2002 to 2010, Turks were generally distressed about their country’s direction. Only in recent years have opinions become somewhat more optimistic. Views about the country’s direction are sharply divided along partisan lines. \t\tAlmost eight-in-ten (79%) supporters of Erdogan’s AKP are satisfied with the current direction of the country, while only 22% among the largest opposition CHP agree.  \t\t Other parties which did well in the recent parliamentary election, including the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a Kurdish political party, did not have a large enough number of supporters in the sample to analyze. There are also divisions on country direction by age, education level and devoutness. Older and more educated Turks, as well as Turkish Muslims who pray 5 times per day or more, are happier with the direction of their country than younger, less educated and less devout Turks. Generally, most Turks agree that children will be worse off than their parents financially when they grow up (52%), versus the 40% who say children will be better off. And in contrast to most other countries surveyed, the young are less hopeful about their future. Only 34% of 18 to 29 year-olds in Turkey say the next generation will be in a better position financially compared with 56% of those Turks ages 50 and older. Among \t\tthe issues tested, rising prices, crime and the gap between rich and poor are seen as the biggest problems in Turkey.  \t\t Lack of employment opportunities (51% saying it is a very big problem) is also seen as a major issue. There are lower levels of concern over corruption among political leaders, poor-quality schools, traffic and health care. But overall, most Turks still see these issues as at least moderately big problems. Turks with less education (less than secondary education equivalent) are more concerned about each of the 8 problems tested compared with their more educated (secondary education or more) counterparts. And generally, older Turks (50+ years-old) are more concerned about each of these issues compared with the country’s youth (18 to 29 year-olds). Positive\t\t sentiment towards President Erdogan has declined significantly in the past year.  \t\t Before the first round of parliamentary elections in June, only 39% of Turks had a favorable view of Erdogan. About half (51%) held a negative view of the former prime minister and de facto ruler of the country. That compares with last year when 51% of Turks had a positive view of Erdogan and in 2013 when he had 62% support. Erdogan’s supporters include AKP followers (87% favorable), Turks ages 50 and older (54%), lower educated Turks (53%) and Muslim Turks who pray 5 times per day or more (71%). The only national institution asked about in the survey that has a positive rating from Turks is the military. \t\tAbout half (52%) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey, while 37% say it is having a bad influence. Turks are divided on many of the other major institutions in their country. Nearly equal numbers say that the police, national government and religious leaders are either a good or bad influence. About four-in-ten (41%) say that the court system has a good effect on the nation, but 48% rate its influence as bad. More Turks say that the media, such as television, radio, newspapers or magazines, is a negative influence. About half (51%) say this, while 38% believe the media is a good influence. Older Turks, those with less education, those who associate with the AKP and Muslims who pray more often are more likely to hold positive views of every institution listed. In other words, those who are more likely to be a part of Erdogan’s coalition are also more likely to say that these national institutions have a good influence on Turkey. Most\t\t Turks still believe that a democratic form of government is the best way to solve their country’s problems.  \t\t However, a growing minority (36%) say that Turkey should rely on a leader with a strong hand to improve their lives. In 2012, only 26% said this, while 68% preferred a democratic form of government when given this choice. Turkish Muslims who hardly ever pray are much more likely to prefer a democratic form of government (78%) compared with those who pray five times per day or more (44%). Additionally, a solid majority (61%) of AKP sympathizers support a strong leader versus a democratic form of government (36%). CHP supporters have almost exactly the opposite opinion; 68% prefer democracy, while 27% prefer a strong leader. The country is evenly divided on how the current democratic system is working in Turkey. Roughly half (49%) are satisfied with the way democracy is working, with an equal 49% saying they are dissatisfied. But almost twice as many people are not at all satisfied with the current state of Turkish democracy (27%) compared with the 14% who are very satisfied. As with many other aspects of Turkish public opinion, there is a clear divide on this issue among different demographic groups. Older Turks, those with less education and those who support the AKP are more likely to be satisfied with the current state of democracy. Additionally, among Turkish Muslims, 72% of those who pray five times per day or more are happy with the current state of Turkish democracy, compared to 34% among those who hardly ever pray. People in Turkey think that their country should garner more respect around the world than it currently does. \t\tIn all, 54% of Turks say they deserve more respect compared with the 36% who think Turkey is as respected as it should be. Supporter of Erdogan’s AKP party are much more likely to say that Turkey is as respected around the world as it should be (53%) compared with followers of the opposition CHP (25%). Despite\t\t low ratings for the EU (just one-third of Turks have a favorable view of the institution), a majority in Turkey (55%) want to become a member while only 32% oppose joining the EU.  \t\t This sentiment has held relatively steady in recent years, although in 2005, more in Turkey (68%) wanted to join the European project. Meanwhile, sentiment towards other world powers is especially negative among Turks. Only 29% have a favorable view of the U.S. and just 23% have a positive opinion of NATO. Faring even worse are China (18% favorable), Iran (17%) and Russia (15%). Turks are hesitant to live up to their Article 5 obligation to come to the aid of another NATO country if it is attacked. \t\tNearly half (47%) say Turkey should not use military force to defend a NATO ally if Russia got into a serious military conflict with that country.  \t\t In this regard, views in Turkey are similar to the 8 other NATO members polled, including the U.S., Canada and 6 EU nations. In those countries, a median of 42% said their country should not use military action if Russia attacks a fellow NATO member. On the other side, only 29% of Turks say they should use force to defend their ally, with around a quarter undecided (23%). Because of the relatively high number of undecided people in Turkey on this question, the percentage saying that they should defend a NATO ally is much lower than the 8 country NATO median (48%). Turks are split on whether the U.S. would come to that NATO country’s aid. Four-in-ten in Turkey say that the U.S. would use military force to defend their NATO ally, while 34% say the U.S. would not and a quarter are undecided. (For more on NATO countries’ views toward Russia and using military force to defend a NATO ally, see NATO Publics Blame Russia for Ukrainian Crisis, but Reluctant to Provide Military Aid, released June 10, 2015). With refugees continuing to stream into Europe, Turks are insistent that fewer of them should be crossing their borders. Two-thirds say that Turkey should allow fewer refugees from Syria and Iraq into their country. Only 8% are willing to accept more refugees, while 13% would like to keep the flow about the same as it is now. Among Muslims, those who are less devout are much more likely to want fewer refugees into the country (82%) compared with the most devout Turkish Muslims (59%). Still, all segments of Turkish society say that Turkey should allow fewer refugees into their southern borders. Meanwhile, in the fight against ISIS, only 36% of Turks wanted to join the anti-Islamic State international coalition led by the U.S. when this survey was fielded. More (44%) thought they should not join the coalition, although many (20%) did not offer an opinion. However, at the time, 48% supported the U.S. military actions against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, with only 30% opposed.","The only national institution asked about in the survey that has a positive rating from Turks is the military . \t\t About half ( 52 % ) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey , while 37 % say it is having a bad influence .

Here are four key findings about educational preferences from a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of 19 countries. 1Publics in advanced economies prefer creative education more than people in emerging economies do. Among advanced economies, half or more in six of the 14 countries surveyed said it is more important that schools teach students to be creative and think independently than to teach students basic academic skills and encourage discipline. By comparison, in all five of the emerging economies included in the survey, fewer than half said the same. Among advanced economies, Americans are in the middle of the pack: 48% support education that emphasizes creative and independent thinking and 42% prefer to prioritize basic academic skills. 2In most advanced economies, educational preferences are an ideological issue. In much of Western Europe, North America and Australia, there are significant differences in how those on the political left and right believe children should be taught. Those on the left tend to prefer that schools focus on teaching creative and independent thinking while those on the right tend to value academic skills and discipline more. The gap is especially large in the United States, where liberals (67%) are twice as likely as conservatives (33%) to favor education that emphasizes independent thinking. 3Younger people in most advanced economies are the most supportive of education that emphasizes creative and independent thinking. The difference is largest in France, where 53% of those ages 18 to 34 say creative education is more important than teaching basic skills, compared with 29% of those 50 and older. In the U.S., the difference between these same groups is 17 points. China stands out as the only emerging country surveyed that has the same age-related patterns. Differences by age are more consistent across countries and are starker than differences by gender, income or even educational attainment. 4The Chinese public stands out from others surveyed in saying they prefer teaching both sets of skills. More than a quarter of Chinese volunteer that schools should emphasize both creative thinking and basic skills and discipline. This may be due in part to their educational system’s reliance on standardized testing (the gaokao). While rote memorization and discipline are seen as keys for success on this future-defining exam, there is much handwringing domestically about how gaokao preparation comes at the expense of more creative opportunities. Younger, wealthier and better educated Chinese are particularly likely to prioritize imagination and creativity in the classroom. Note: See here for topline results, economic categorization information and methodology.","The Chinese public stands out from others surveyed in saying they prefer teaching both sets of skills .

But based on revenue, those businesses are on average considerably smaller than white- or male-owned firms, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall, men owned more than half of the nation’s 27.6 million firms in 2012, according to preliminary results from the Survey of Business Owners, and women owned more than 9.9 million businesses, about 36% of the total. The remaining 10% of firms were either jointly owned by men and women or could not be categorized by gender because they were publicly traded companies or have large, diverse ownership groups. The data for the Census Bureau’s twice-a-decade survey includes all firms — incorporated or not, with and without paid employees — with receipts of $1,000 or more in 2012. A handful of firm types are excluded, including farms, railroads, funds and trusts, churches, foundations, civic groups and professional organization, the Postal Service and the Federal Reserve. About two-thirds of the 1.75 million businesses in the survey sample responded. Women-owned firms made up sizable shares of some industries. For example, more than half of all firms in the health care/social assistance and educational services industries were owned by women in 2012. Women also owned more than half of the businesses in the miscellaneous “other services” category. But women-owned firms didn’t earn a proportionate share of industry revenues. (The analysis is complicated by the fact that well over half of all business revenues go to a relatively small number of publicly held companies and other firms that aren’t classifiable by gender, race or ethnicity. For that reason, the sales comparisons that follow refer only to the 27.5 million firms that are classifiable in those ways.) The combined sales of all women-owned firms in the country, for instance, were $1.6 trillion in 2012 – 11.3% of the $14.3 trillion in total receipts reported that year by all classifiable firms. Male-owned firms had 79.2% of total classifiable sales; those whose ownership was equally male and female had 9.5%. Although 64.5% of classifiable health care and social assistance firms were owned by women in 2012, those firms received just 19.9% of that industry’s $703.5 billion in total classifiable revenues. Among classifiable educational-services firms, 56.9% were women-owned but they took in only 28.1% of the industry’s classifiable revenues. Mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction stood out among the major industry groups: Women-owned businesses in that industry had a greater share of classifiable revenues (18.8%) than they represented as a share of all classifiable firms (17.7%). Overall, about 29% of firms (nearly 8 million) were owned by blacks or Asians. About 12% were owned by Hispanics, who can be of any race. Sales at minority-owned businesses as a group totaled nearly $1.6 trillion in 2012, or 10.9% of all classifiable revenues. About half of those sales went to Asian-owned firms, who accounted for 5.5% of classifiable sales and 7.1% of classifiable businesses. The 12.1% of classifiable businesses with Hispanic ownership received only 3.6% of classifiable sales, or $517.4 billion. The data show that some sectors more than others have a significant share of minority-owned firms. Nearly a fifth of health care/social assistance businesses and about 15% of transportation/warehousing businesses were owned by blacks. Asian Americans owned about 19% of firms in the accommodation and food services industry. (Note: The SBO defines “ownership” as having 51% or more of the stock or equity in the business. Also, all findings are based on preliminary data and may change when the Census Bureau releases final data in December.) Fewer than one-in-five of all firms (19.6%) had paid employees in 2012, and those that did were considerably larger (averaging nearly $6 million in annual sales, versus less than $48,000 for firms with no paid employees). Among firms with employees, women-owned firms employed fewer people on average than male-owned firms (8.5 versus 13.5); minority-owned firms had smaller payrolls (8.4 employees on average) than non-minority-owned firms (12.6 employees).","Women , blacks , Asians and Hispanics have built up substantial positions as business owners in several sectors of the U.S. economy .

Simpson’s recent arrest on robbery and assault charges was the most heavily covered news story last week. Yet public interest in the Simpson case was fairly modest. Overall, just 13% of Americans say they followed reports about Simpson’s arrest very closely, while 17% listed it as the single story they followed most closely. By contrast, there was much greater public interest in the situation in Iraq: 32% say they paid very close attention to the war, and 25% followed it more closely than any other story last week. Simpson’s latest legal troubles drew somewhat more interest from blacks than whites. About a quarter of blacks (24%) cited Simpson’s arrest as the week’s top story, compared with 15% of whites. There was broad agreement among both blacks and whites, however, that Simpson’s case received too much press coverage though the coverage was fair. A much larger racial gap emerged on another high profile news story: the demonstrations in Jena, Louisiana in support of six black teenagers involved in a schoolyard fight. The so-called Jena Six story was by far the biggest story of the week among African Americans. Fully half of blacks say they followed this story very closely, while 40% listed it as the story they followed most closely last week. By contrast, just 11% of whites followed the story very closely and 9% listed it as their top story. The national news media devoted 5% of its coverage to this story, which is less than half of the amount of coverage that news organizations devoted to the Simpson arrest (13%). When asked about the main reason why many people are following the Simpson story, 66% of the public says it is because they want to see him finally convicted of a crime. Another 20% say people follow this story because they have an ongoing interest in news about Simpson. Just 3% believe that people follow the story because they sympathize with the former football star. Blacks and whites are largely in agreement on this question: 66% of whites and 63% of blacks say most people follow the Simpson story because they want to see him finally get convicted. The news media receives divided marks for its coverage of the Simpson story. Six-in-ten Americans say the coverage has been fair, but about as many (62%) say the story has gotten too much press coverage. About the same numbers of blacks and whites rate the coverage of Simpson’s arrest as fair, though somewhat more blacks view the coverage as unfair (32% vs. 17%). The racial gap was much larger in opinions about coverage of former quarterback Michael Vick’s recent legal problems. More than half of blacks (51%) thought Vick was treated unfairly by the media, compared with only 12% of whites. Nearly two-thirds of Americans (62%) say the press overcovered the Simpson story, compared with 26% who view the amount of coverage as appropriate, and 5% who say it received too little coverage. The views of blacks and whites are nearly identical on this question. Just 37% of the public say that they found the Simpson story interesting. On this measure blacks and whites have slightly different views. Slightly more than a third of whites (35%) view this story as interesting, compared with 51% of African Americans. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage was collected from September 16-21 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week was collected September 21-24 from a nationally representative sample of 1,005 adults. Despite the modest interest in his case, O.J. Simpson tops the list of prominent names in the news for last week. When asked to name the person they have heard the most about in the news lately, 26% name Simpson. Blacks are almost twice as likely as whites to name Simpson. President Bush came in second place at 21%. On only one other occasion this year has someone other than Bush been the most visible newsmaker. In February, Anna Nicole Smith topped Bush by a significant margin shortly after her death (38% named Smith and 28% named Bush). Britney Spears came in third place on the list of top newsmakers last week (12%). The Iraq war was the news story the public followed most closely last week. Nearly a third of the public (32%) followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 25% listed this as the story they followed most closely. The percentage of Americans following the war has remained remarkably steady throughout the year. The national news media devoted 10% of its overall coverage to events in Iraq last week and 5% to the Iraq policy debate. Coverage of the Iraq policy debate declined sharply from the previous week when Gen. Petraeus’ report to Congress and Bush’s prime-time address made it the top news story. Public interest in the story remained unchanged from the previous week: 25% followed the Iraq policy debate very closely and 9% said this was the story they followed most closely. Roughly a quarter of the public (24%) paid very close attention to news about the 2008 presidential campaign and 10% listed this as their top news story of the week. Democrats continued to follow campaign news more closely than Republicans. Coverage of the campaign comprised 9% of the national newshole, making it the third most heavily covered news story of the week. There was relatively little public interest in President Bush’s nomination of Michael Mukasey as attorney general. Overall, just 9% say they paid very close attention to this story and 2% listed it as their most closely followed story. The national news media devoted 4% of coverage to the nomination. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Sunday through Friday) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

The share of voters younger than 30 who are following campaign news very closely is roughly half what it was at this point four years ago (18%, down from 35%). Just 63% of young registered voters say they definitely plan to vote this year, down from 72% four years ago. Not only are young registered voters less engaged, but fewer young people are registered to vote. In all Pew Research Center polling conducted over the course of 2012, only half (50%) of adults under 30 say they are absolutely certain that they are registered. This compares with 61% in 2008 and 57% in 2004. Registration rates typically rise over the course of election years, but for youth voter registration to reach 2008 levels the figures will have to shift decidedly over the coming month. Both of these trends are disadvantages for Barack Obama, who continues to hold a wide lead among young voters. In the latest Pew Research Center survey, conducted Sept. 12-16, registered voters under 30 favored Obama over Romney by 59% to 33%, and that margin has held relatively steady over the course of the year. But so far, any potential damage to Obama has been mitigated by three factors. First, the decline in youth engagement is not limited to Obama supporters. In fact, the dropoff is at least as steep among young voters who intend to vote Republican. Second, other segments of Obama’s electoral base – notably African Americans – remain highly engaged in the election. Third, declining engagement in a key Republican subgroup – moderate Republicans – at least partially offsets falling interest among the young. While most measures of voter engagement remain fairly high in 2012, overall interest and commitment to voting is down slightly when compared with the highly-charged 2008 election campaign. The share of registered voters who score high (three out of four) on a scale of four questions about interest in the campaign and intention to vote has slipped from 86% to 80% overall. This slippage is particularly steep among voters under 30; just 61% are highly engaged in the 2012 campaign, down from 75% at this point four years ago. By contrast, fully 86% of voters 65 and older are highly engaged, which is unchanged from four years ago. Interest also is down among voters 30-to-49 (eight points) and those 50-to-64 (six points), although both groups remain more engaged in the election than those under 30. The drop in youth engagement does not have a political tilt to it; the slippage is equally evident among both Obama and Romney supporters. Among voters under 40 who support Obama, 58% have given a lot of thought to the election this year, down from 70% among young Obama supporters four years ago. But the trend among young Republican voters is almost identical. Just 59% of young voters who support Romney have given a lot of thought to the election, down from 75% among young McCain supporters in 2008. (For this analysis, all voters under age 40 are analyzed because there are too few 18-to-29- year-old Romney supporters to evaluate separately.) The decline in engagement among voters age 40-to-64 also has come among voters in both parties. Among Obama supporters in this age group, there has been a 12-point decline in the percentage giving a lot of thought to the election; among Romney supporters 40-to-64, there has been an eight-point decline since 2008. Engagement among voters 65 and older is similar to 2008; older Obama and Romney supporters are as engaged as Obama and McCain supporters were in 2008. The pattern is nearly identical in levels of campaign news interest. Fewer voters younger than 40 and 40-to-64 say they are very closely following campaign news than in 2008 and the declines are comparable among Obama supporters and Romney supporters. Voters 65 and older are as interested in campaign news as they were four years ago; there are no differences between Obama and Romney voters. This pattern is consistent with the lack of an engagement gap between Republicans and Democrats overall. Since the summer, Democratic interest in the campaign has surged, closing an engagement deficit that was apparent earlier in the year. While younger voters make up a larger share of the Democratic base – and their enthusiasm decline could affect Democratic turnout levels in November – there is a comparable decline in GOP engagement as well, particularly in the moderate wing of the party. Just 73% of moderate and liberal Republicans, a group that accounts for 27% of Republican voters overall, are highly engaged in the current survey, down from 89% four years ago. Drop in Voter Registration, Especially Among Young Voter registration rates have declined since 2008, especially among young people. In interviews conducted over the course of 2012 so far, 72% of adults 18 and older say they are absolutely certain they are registered to vote. This is lower than in 2008, when 79% were registered to vote and in 2004 (76% registered to vote). In polls conducted from January to September, just half of those under 30 are certain they are registered to vote – 11 points lower than in 2008 – and the lowest number in the past 16 years of Pew Research Center polling. There also has been a nine-point decline in voter registration among those 30-to-49. Voter registration has slipped four points among those 50-to-64 but is virtually unchanged among those 65 and older. More people still may register to vote in the five weeks remaining before the election. Voter registration typically increases in the second half of election years, especially among young people. In 2008, the share of young adults who said they were certain they were registered jumped six percentage points from the first half to the second half of the year. Yet even when these seasonal factors are taken into account, young adults are starting this year with the lowest registration rate of the last five presidential elections. In polling conducted over the first six months of 2012, half (50%) of adults younger than 30 say they are certain that they are registered. This compares to a 57% registration rate in the first half of 2008, which rose to 64% over the latter part of that year. Throughout this election cycle, Obama has consistently held a substantial lead over Romney among young voters. In polls conducted since April, he holds a 59% to 35% advantage among registered voters under 30. That is somewhat narrower than the 66% to 32% margin he had over McCain in 2008. Obama has lost support from 2008 among young men and young white voters. Obama holds a 53% to 40% advantage over Romney among men under 30 but that is narrower than the 27-point margin he had over McCain in 2008. There has been little change among young women voters; 65% back Obama while just 31% support Romney. There is now a 12-point gap in Obama’s support between young men and young women. Obama has lost substantial ground among young white voters. He had a 10-point advantage among this group in 2008, but they are now divided (47% support Obama, 47% support Romney). Young non-whites still back Obama by a wide margin (81% to 14%). Obama’s support is equally strong among younger and older members of the 18-29 age group. He leads Romney by 60% to 35% among voters ages 18-24 and by 57%-36% among those in the 25-29 age group. Among voters 18-21, who were not eligible to vote in 2008, Obama holds a 61% to 36% margin. Similarly, Obama receives about the same level of support from young voters who have attended college and those that have not.","Voter registration rates have declined since 2008 , especially among young people .

Yet there are sharp partisan differences on several other issues – particularly on whether to let people carry concealed guns in more places and to allow teachers and officials to carry guns in K-12 schools, a new Pew Research Center survey has found. And Republicans and Democrats have stark, fundamental differences on questions relating to the causes of gun violence – and even whether gun violence is a serious problem in the country. The widest partisan divides over gun policies are on proposals to allow concealed carry in more places and to permit teachers to carry guns. About seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners favor allowing concealed carry in more places (72%) and allowing teachers and officials to carry guns in K-12 schools (69%); just 26% of Democrats and Democratic leaners favor each of these proposals. Democrats also largely oppose proposals to shorten waiting periods for those who want to buy guns legally (25% favor, 74% oppose), while Republicans are divided (51% favor, 48% oppose). There is little support in either party for allowing concealed carry without a permit, though the proposal finds more support among the GOP (30%) than Democrats (10%). Partisan divisions over gun policy proposals may reflect contrasting views among Republicans and Democrats on gun violence in the country today and on the impact of access to guns on crime and mass shootings. Though clear majorities of both Republicans (74%) and Democrats (92%) consider gun violence to be at least a moderately big problem in the U.S., a much greater share of Democrats (65%) than Republicans (32%) say gun violence is a “very big” problem in the country. And while both Republicans and Democrats are less likely to perceive gun violence as a big problem in their local community than in the nation as a whole, Democrats also are more likely than Republicans (54% vs. 31%) to say gun violence in their local community is a very or moderately big problem. When it comes to views about some potential contributing factors to gun violence, Democrats and Republicans deeply disagree over the degree to which legally obtained guns contribute to gun violence. About three-quarters (76%) of Democrats say the ease with which people can legally obtain guns contributes a great deal or fair amount to gun violence, compared with just 39% of Republicans. By contrast, more than eight-in-ten Republicans (84%) and Democrats (88%) say the ease with which people can illegally obtain guns contributes a great deal or a fair amount to gun violence. Republicans and Democrats also diverge in their views about how gun ownership impacts crime and mass shootings in the U.S. A majority of Republicans (56%) say there would be less crime if more Americans owned guns; by contrast, 51% of Democrats say there would be more crime if more Americans had guns. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats (64%) say there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were harder for people to legally obtain guns; only about a quarter of Republicans (27%) say the same. And Republicans are skeptical that making it harder to legally obtain guns would have an effect on mass shootings: 54% say it would not make a difference, while 18% think restricting access to guns would lead to more mass shootings.","Nearly two - thirds of Democrats ( 64 % ) say there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were harder for people to legally obtain guns ; only about a quarter of Republicans ( 27 % ) say the same .

The challenge—as is the case with other digital ad revenue—is that big tech firms such as Google and Facebook are poised to pocket a large share of the digital video ad dollars because they are able to more effectively monetize video content. As part of its State of the News Media 2014 report, the Pew Research Center surveyed U.S. adults about their digital video habits to get a sense of that marketplace today. Here’s what we found: 11The digital video advertising market is relatively small, but it is growing rapidly. According to eMarketer, digital video advertising in 2013 accounted for about 10% of the overall digital advertising market. But digital video ad revenue reached $4.15 billion in 2013, which represents a 44% increase from 2012 and almost a tripling of the revenue from 2010. YouTube is estimated to account for 20.5% of that that $4.15 billion in digital video advertising, and eMarketer estimates that its share will continue to grow, leaving fewer ad dollars for news organizations. 21Digital video consumption is growing and digital news video consumption is growing with it. Almost two-thirds of U.S. adults now watch videos online and more than half of those (36%) watch news videos. This is up from 40% of U.S. adults who watched or downloaded any kind of video in 2007 and 26% who watched or downloaded news videos. 31Younger adult Americans consume more digital video and digital news video than older ones. Nearly half of adults ages 18 to 29 watch online news video. That substantially outpaces that of older Americans.  And it stands in contrast with surveys showing that when it comes to television news viewing habits, 18-29 year-olds tend to watch less than any other age group. 41More highly educated and wealthier Americans are more likely to watch digital news video. Slightly more than half of Americans with a bachelor or graduate degree from college (52%) watch news video online. This is moderately higher than the video news viewing of those who completed some college (43%) and more than double the rate of those with a high school degree or less (22%). In addition, Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year in household income are more likely watch news videos online. 51User-generated content is becoming part of the digital news video experience. According to Pew Research Center survey data 12% of social media users have posted their own videos of news events to social networking sites. In addition, 11% of online news consumers have submitted their own content—including videos, photos, articles or opinion pieces—to news organizations or blogs. One example of a news organization trying integrate this consumer content was NBC’s 2013 purchase of Stringwire, a company that helps consumers shoot live video and send it directly to NBC news facilities.","Younger adult Americans consume more digital video and digital news video than older ones .

But while the Muslim gender gap in education remains large, relative to most other major religious groups, it has narrowed in recent generations: Muslim women have made greater educational gains than Muslim men in most regions of the world, according to Pew Research Center’s comprehensive new study on educational attainment among the world’s major religious groups. The study looked at changes in educational attainment across three recent generations, finding that the youngest generation of Muslim adults analyzed (born 1976 to 1985) have far more formal education than those in the oldest generation analyzed (born 1936 to 1955). While both men and women are contributing to these gains, women have been gaining at a faster rate. The oldest Muslim women in the study averaged just 2.5 years of schooling, compared with 4.6 years for men – a gap of 2.1 years. Young women (ages 25 to 34 as of 2010), by comparison, have averaged more than twice as many years of formal education as their female elders (6.1 years), and now trail young men (7.3 years) by just over a year. Another way to measure education is by looking at the percentage of people with no formal schooling, and the Muslim gender gap also has narrowed from this perspective. Globally, a majority of the oldest generation of Muslim women analyzed (64%) had no formal schooling, but this figure is 31 percentage points lower among the youngest generation (33%). Meanwhile, the share of Muslim men who never received any formal education dropped by a more-modest 20 points across three generations (43% to 23%). At the other end of the attainment spectrum, relatively few Muslim men and women have post-secondary degrees. But in some places, Muslim women’s gains in post-secondary education were so dramatic that the gender gap has reversed, meaning that, in the youngest generation, more Muslim women than men hold college degrees. This pattern has been particularly striking in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and other nations that are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional political and economic union. In Saudi Arabia, for example, the share of Muslim women holding post-secondary degrees rose from 3% in the oldest generation analyzed to 35% in the youngest generation. Among Saudi Muslim men, the share with higher education rose from 16% to 28%. This general pattern of Muslim women making greater educational gains than Muslim men has not extended to sub-Saharan Africa. Across the three generations in our study, Muslim gender gaps in that region remained largely unchanged and sometimes even widened. Although Muslim women in this region have made some gains, they have done so at a slower rate than their male peers. The gender gap in average years of schooling illustrates this trend. The youngest Muslim men in sub-Saharan Africa gained 2.4 more years of schooling, on average, than the oldest Muslim men, while the youngest Muslim women gained only 1.7 more years of schooling over their elders. But in other regions, Muslim women have gained on men. In Europe, for instance, Muslim women and men average virtually the same number of years of schooling among the youngest generation analyzed, and in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East-North Africa regions – together home to most of the world’s Muslims – the gaps have narrowed considerably.","The study looked at changes in educational attainment across three recent generations , finding that the youngest generation of Muslim adults analyzed ( born 1976 to 1985 ) have far more formal education than those in the oldest generation analyzed ( born 1936 to 1955 ) .

During the same time period, Obama’s job approval rating has slipped 15 points among Hispanics. About half of Hispanics (48%) approve of Obama’s job performance today, down from 63% in September 2013. (Among the general public today, 44% approve of Obama and 41% approve of the new law, neither significantly changed from September.) Since the troubled launch of the online health care exchange on Oct. 1, news coverage has noted low Hispanic enrollment and included criticism that the Spanish-language version of the website contained poor translations. Others have disputed that claim, arguing a major hurdle in enrolling more Hispanics in health insurance has been that many don’t understand the law. Another cause of low enrollment may be fear of federal authorities among U.S. citizens and residents with family members who are unauthorized immigrants. In some respects, Hispanics might seem to be natural supporters of the president’s health care law. Most Hispanics (61%) say it is the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health coverage, compared with 47% of the public overall who say this. Some 29% of Hispanics don’t have health insurance, according to the 2012 American Community Survey. Then there’s the issue of immigration. In a Pew Research survey in November, 51% of Hispanics disapproved of the way Obama was handling immigration. Meanwhile, 72% of Hispanics last month said it was “extremely” or “very” important this year to have new immigration legislation, which has stalled in Congress. In recent weeks, Democrats and Hispanic leaders have stepped up criticism of Obama’s immigration policies as the number of unauthorized immigrants deported nears two million under the president’s administration. Obama has responded by meeting with Hispanic leaders and ordering a review of immigration enforcement policies. This is not the first time that Obama’s support among Hispanics has fallen. At the end of 2011, a time when the rising number of deportations also received public attention, the president’s approval fell to 49% among Hispanics. It bounced back during the 2012 presidential campaign, and Obama captured 71% of the Hispanic vote. Whether the shrinking support for Obama and the health care law among Hispanics translates into consequences for Democrats during this year’s midterm elections remains unclear. Among registered voters, Hispanic support of Democratic candidates remained strong in our February survey. In a generic congressional ballot, Hispanics would favor the Democrat candidates for Congress in their district over Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin (63%-31%). That margin is roughly the same as in 2010, when the split on Election Day was 60% to 38%, in favor of Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives, according to National Election Pool exit polls. But it’s worth noting that Hispanic turnout has lagged behind the rest of the public in past elections. Despite a fast-growing population that makes up 11% of the nation’s eligible voters (U.S. citizen adults), Hispanics made up just 8% of the electorate in 2012 and 7% in 2010. See our general public questionnaire results and methodology. Note: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated the percentage of eligible voters (U.S. citizen adults) that Hispanics comprise. It is 11%.","Support of President Obama and his signature legislation , the Affordable Care Act , has declined among Hispanics over the past six months , even though the popularity of both is nearly unchanged among the public overall , according to a new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data .

Last September, a Marriott hotel in Islamabad, the nation’s capital, was bombed, killing more than 50 people, and overall there have been approximately 60 suicide bombings in Pakistan in each of the last two years. In recent months, Taliban fighters have terrorized much of the once stable Swat Valley, implementing a strict version of Islamic law, banning music, closing girls’ schools, and killing opponents. Earlier this month, the government agreed to a truce with supposedly moderate elements within the Taliban in Swat Valley, although whether the truce will hold and what it will mean for local residents remains unclear. These headline-making assaults have, however, been perpetrated in a country where public support for extremism has declined sharply in recent years. Surveys by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project have found progressively lower levels of acceptance of suicide bombing as well as waning confidence in Osama bin Laden.1 There is only modest support among Pakistanis for al Qaeda or the Taliban. And few agree with their widely noted tactic of preventing education for girls. Nonetheless, while the trends are positive, sizeable minorities still embrace extremism — for instance, one-in-three continue to express confidence in bin Laden, who many intelligence analysts believe is hiding somewhere in western Pakistan. And while most Pakistanis are worried about religious extremism, polling by the International Republican Institute (IRI) suggests they are not convinced the Pakistani army should be used to fight radical groups. Instead, most would prefer making a peace deal with extremists. As recently as 2004, roughly four-in-ten (41%) Pakistani Muslims said suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians could be justified to protect Islam from its enemies. However, by the time of the April 2008 Pew Global survey — following a four year period in which numerous suicide attacks took place within Pakistan — only 5% held this view. Attitudes toward bin Laden have also turned more negative, although the decline is less steep. In 2005, about half (51%) of Pakistanis expressed confidence in bin Laden to do the right thing in world affairs. Three years later, roughly one-third (34%) voiced this opinion. The 2008 poll also found that, on balance, Pakistanis expressed negative opinions of al Qaeda and the Taliban. Still, about one-quarter of Pakistanis had favorable views of these groups, and many were unable, or unwilling, to offer a rating. “Don’t know” responses were especially common among women and respondents from the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), which shares a border with Afghanistan. The survey also found that younger Pakistanis were less likely to embrace extremism. Only three-in-ten under age 50 expressed confidence in bin Laden, compared with about half (52%) of those age 50 and older — a difference of 22 percentage points. Less pronounced, but still notable, differences were found between younger and older Pakistanis on views of the Taliban and al Qaeda. Only a quarter (25%) of those under the age of 50 said they had a favorable opinion of the Taliban, while more than one-third (36%) of those 50 and older expressed a favorable sentiment. Similarly, Pakistanis under 50 were less likely than those in the 50-plus age category to express a favorable view of al Qaeda (23% vs. 31%). One of the Taliban’s most notorious tactics in the Swat Valley has been the destruction of schools for girls. On this issue, as the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes poll demonstrated, they are out of step with the vast majority of Pakistanis. About three-in-four (74%) Pakistanis said that education is equally important for girls and boys, while just 17% considered it more important for boys and 7% believed it is more important for girls. There were no significant differences between men and women, or between younger and older Pakistanis, on this issue. However, the view that education is equally important for girls and boys was slightly less common among ethnic Pashtuns than among members of other ethnic groups. While a majority (54%) of Pashtuns held this view, a large minority (32%) believed education is more important for boys. Overwhelmingly, Pakistanis are worried about the impact of extremism. In 2008, 72% said they were concerned about Islamic extremism in their country, and over half — 54% — said they were very concerned, the highest percentage among the eight countries on the survey where the question was asked (the others were Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Lebanon, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Turkey). Similarly, an October 2008 IRI poll found that 60% of Pakistanis characterized religious extremism as a serious problem. However, the same poll found limited support for using the Pakistani military to combat extremist groups. Just 38% of Pakistanis supported using the Army to fight extremists in NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), while half opposed such efforts. About one-third (34%) said they would like to see the Army confront al Qaeda, while 52% disagreed with this view. There was even less enthusiasm for taking on the Taliban — 30% favored this approach, 56% opposed it. Nonetheless, support for military action had increased since IRI’s previous poll in June 2008, when only 27% wanted the Army to fight extremists in NWFP/FATA, 22% said it should fight al Qaeda, and 20% felt this way about the Taliban. The October poll also found considerable support for cutting a deal with radical groups — 54% agreed with the statement “I support a peace deal with the extremists,” while just 35% disagreed. The question did not specify any particular groups of extremists, but it is clear that, as a general approach, the Pakistani public preferred compromise. Here again however, the minority supporting confrontation was growing — in June, 64% had supported a peace deal and only 18% had opposed one.","About three - in - four ( 74 % ) Pakistanis said that education is equally important for girls and boys , while just 17 % considered it more important for boys and 7 % believed it is more important for girls .","What are Pakistanis views on boy and girl education importance?","About three - in - four ( 74 % ) Pakistanis said that education is equally important for girls and boys , while just 17 % considered it more important for boys and 7 % believed it is more important for girls .","About three - in - four ( 74 % ) Pakistanis said that education is equally important for girls and boys , while just 17 % considered it more important for boys and 7 % believed it is more important for girls ."],"3525":["3525.png","Partisan Differences in Concerns over Islamic Extremism","As President Obama prepares to address the nation about the militant group ISIS, the public has become more worried about Islamic extremism. Six-in-ten (62%) are very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, which is the largest share dating back to 2007. A somewhat smaller majority (53%) is very concerned about the possibility of rising Islamic extremism in the U.S, which ties a record high. The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 2-9 among 2,002 adults, finds that ratings of the government’s job in reducing terrorism have worsened since late last year. Roughly four-in-ten (42%) say the government is doing “not too well” or “not at all well” in reducing the terror threat, up 16 points from November. While the new survey does not ask about ISIS specifically, 67% last month identified the militant group in Iraq and Syria as a “major threat” to the U.S. The survey also finds a shifting balance between concerns about civil liberties and protection from terrorism. In a reversal from last year after Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks, 50% today say they are more concerned that government anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to protect the country, while 35% are more concerned that the policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties. In July 2013, 47% said their greater concern was that government policies had gone too far in restricting civil liberties, while fewer (35%) said their bigger concern was inadequate security. That marked the first time in nearly a decade of Pew Research Center polling that more expressed concern over civil liberties than protection against terrorism. There also has been a shift in views about whether Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its followers. Currently, 50% say Islam is more likely to encourage violence among its followers, while 39% say it is not more likely to encourage violence. Opinion about whether Islam is more likely to encourage violence has fluctuated over the years, but as recently as mid-July, the public was divided (43% more likely to encourage violence vs. 44% not more likely). Looking both domestically and internationally, Republicans are more concerned than Democrats about the rise of Islamic extremism. About eight-in-ten Republicans (82%) are very concerned when it comes to Islamic extremism in the world and 71% are very concerned about the U.S. specifically; among Democrats, about half (51%) are very concerned internationally and 46% nationally. Concern about rising Islamic extremism in the world (62% very concerned) is 25 points higher than it was in July 2011 and 13 points higher than in November 2009, shortly after the Ft. Hood shootings. Concern about extremism in the U.S. (53% very concerned) is 17 points higher than three years ago, but similar to 2009 (52%), after the Ft. Hood incident. Both Republicans and Democrats register a much greater level of concern than they did three years ago. Worries about Islamic extremism in the U.S. especially have grown among older adults. Two-thirds of adults ages 50-64 (66%) and about seven-in-ten of those 65 and older (71%) are very concerned about Islamic extremism domestically, up about 25 points from 2011. Just 31% of those younger than 30 are very concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism in the U.S., which is little changed from three years ago (24%). (The trends are similar in views of the rise of Islamic extremism worldwide.) At the same time, there has been a substantial drop in the public’s ratings of the government’s efforts to reduce terrorism. Though a 56% majority says the government is doing very well or fairly well, this is a 16-point decline from last November. About four-in-ten (42%) say the government is doing not too well or not at all well, which nears the post-9/11 high of 44% in early 2007. Republican dissatisfaction has nearly doubled since last fall, from 30% then to 58% today saying the government is not doing a good job. Since last year, the share of Democrats saying this has increased only modestly, from 20% to 26%. During the Obama era, Republicans consistently have given lower marks than Democrats to the government’s anti-terrorism efforts. However, the partisan gap was even greater (and in the opposite direction) late in George W. Bush’s tenure; in 2007, 62% of Democrats rated the government’s job in the reducing terrorism as not good, compared with just 16% of Republicans. In addition, a growing share of the public expresses concerns that the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country (50%) rather than going too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (35%). This is a shift from when this question was asked last year after revelations about the NSA’s domestic surveillance program. Pluralities then said they were more concerned that the government had gone too far (47% in July and 44% in November). Today, the balance of opinion is similar to the public’s views in late 2010. Last November, partisans on both sides were roughly divided on the balance between protection and civil liberties, but that is not the case today. Concerns that anti-terrorism policies haven’t gone far enough have increased 23 points among Republicans to 64%; among Tea Party Republicans, 59% say this, up 26 points. Meanwhile, there has been no significant Democratic shift (48% today vs. 43% in November). But the party remains internally divided; 46% of liberal Democrats are more concerned about the government going too far in restricting civil liberties, compared with 32% of conservative and moderate Democrats. An increasing share of the public believes that Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its believers, reaching a high since 2002. Currently, 50% say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, up from 43% in July and 38% in February. Republicans continue to be more likely than Democrats to say Islam encourages violence more than other religions. But increasing shares of both parties express this view. Among Republicans, two-thirds (67%) say Islam is more likely to encourage violence — up 13 points since February; just 23% say Islam does not encourage violence more than others. About four-in-ten Democrats (42%) say Islam is more likely to encourage violence — up 14 points — while 48% say it is not more likely. Internally, there are divisions within both parties. Conservative Republicans are 20 points more likely than moderates and liberals to say Islam encourages violence more than others (72% vs. 52%). And more conservative and moderate Democrats say this than do liberal Democrats (46% vs. 35%). Just 33% of those under 30 say Islam encourages violence more than other religions and this sentiment has remained roughly constant over the past year. Older adults, however, are increasingly likely to say that Islam encourages violence. Fully 64% of adults 65 and older say this, an increase of 18 points since February. Seven-in-ten white evangelical Protestants say Islam encourages violence more than other religions, the highest percentage of any religious group. Among the religiously unaffiliated, just 35% say Islam is more likely to encourage violence among its believers.","Looking both domestically and internationally , Republicans are more concerned than Democrats about the rise of Islamic extremism .

After all, is it not the young whose lives and health are most on the line in any military action? Yet, nearly four decades of survey data show a far more complex and often contradictory reality than does the popular hawk/dove dichotomy. There is a generation gap over U.S. military interventions­but it is older Americans, not young people, who typically show the greatest wariness about using military force. This was evident during the war in Vietnam and remains the case today. Pew surveys now show that roughly half of those in every age group­except for those ages 50 to 64­ believe the decision to go to war in Iraq was right. And until recently, senior citizens were the least enthusiastic­last fall, for example, just 39% of those ages 65 and over felt it was right to go to war, while 50% said it was wrong. While young people are at least as supportive of the war as those in other age groups, they are also more likely to support efforts to secure peaceful resolutions through diplomacy and multilateral approaches as well as humanitarian interventions abroad. Americans under age 30 also give priority to domestic concerns over foreign policy in matters of governance. The generation gap in attitudes toward using force in Iraq was greater in the months leading up to the war. A Pew Research Center commentary analyzing data from August through September of 2002 found solid majorities in every age cohort between 18 and 64 – including 69% of those under age 30 – in favor of taking military action in Iraq. But those in the oldest age cohort – ages 65 and older – were considerably more wary of using force; just 51% were in favor while 31% were opposed. It is not only in the latest Iraq war that younger and older people have disagreed about the use of military force. In 1990, following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, 70% of people under age 30 favored military action against Iraq if economic sanctions failed, compared with just 52% of those ages 50 and older. And on the eve of war in January 1991, young people favored military action over giving sanctions more time by a 54% to 40% margin. People age 50 and older were evenly divided (45% to 45%). It was the older generation that worried most about U.S. forces sustaining high numbers of casualties. In the 1990s, the use of U.S. troops for peacekeeping missions divided generations. Times-Mirror Center surveys conducted in 1994 posited potential scenarios in which U.S. forces might be used. In every situation, Americans ages 65 and older were far less willing to support the deployment of U.S. ground forces. These scenarios envisioned such purposes as sending troops to prevent famines, restore law and order in Asian or African countries if their governments completely broke down, or dispatching troops to the Middle East to make sure that U.S. oil supplies would not be cut. Younger people were more likely to support the use of air power in these hypothetical scenarios as well. Citing such observations in a 1995 Aspen Institute report, “The United States and the Use of Force in the Post-Cold War Era,” Andrew Kohut and Robert Toth concluded that interventionists were much more likely to be found among Americans under the age of 30.1 During the Vietnam War, Gallup surveys showed that not only were older people less supportive of President Lyndon Johnson’s Vietnam policies early on, but they also were more likely to say the United States made a mistake in sending troops to fight there. In August 1965, just 41% of those ages 50 and older approved of Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam situation. Americans under age 30 were far more positive toward Johnson’s performance on Vietnam (56% approval). The generation gap in attitudes toward the Vietnam War did not erode over time. Gallup surveys conducted between 1965 and 1973 show that over time people of all ages increasingly expressed the view that U.S. involvement in Vietnam was a mistake, but the broadest criticism always came from older generations. In August of 1965, people ages 50 and older were already twice as likely as those under 30 (by a 29% to 15% margin) to say sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. Nearly eight years later, as U.S. forces were about to be completely withdrawn, majorities in all age groups saw Vietnam as a mistake, but younger people remained far less likely to take this view (53%) than those age 50 and older (69%).2 Older Americans are more opposed to the use of military force than those in other age groups, but most believe that, in principle, the best way to ensure peace is through military strength rather than effective diplomacy. Americans under age 30 generally favor the opposite approach. Since 1987, the belief in military strength as the best way to ensure peace has never fallen below 60% among those ages 65 and older, while on average only 44% of younger Americans subscribe to that opinion. Younger people also have a much more favorable opinion of the United Nations than do older Americans and are more likely to say that the international body has a good influence on the way things are going in the United States. Even today, at a time when the public’s ratings of the U.N. are at record lows, young people hold the international organization in relatively high esteem. Today fully 58% of those under 30 say they have a favorable opinion of the U.N., while just 35% of those ages 65 and older say the same. The same generational difference is seen in a 2002 survey that showed a quarter of young people saying the United Nations was having a very good influence on the way things are going in the United States compared with only 14% of those over 65 who said so. By the same token, the young are also more likely to favor a cooperative approach to foreign policy, and express less concern about maintaining America’s sole superpower status. In a December 2004 survey fully 62% of those under age 30 said U.S. foreign policy should take into account the interests of its allies even if it means making compromises with them. Fewer than half (46%) of those ages 65 and older said the same. And in Pew’s latest foreign policy survey, conducted Oct. 12-24, young respondents were divided over whether U.S. foreign policy should try to keep it so that America is the only military superpower (45%) or whether it would be acceptable if another country became as powerful as the U.S. (40%). By contrast, those ages 65 and older favored preventing the emergence of rival superpowers by more than two-to-one (56% to 24%). Despite their wariness of U.S. military action, older Americans are more likely than those in younger age groups to hold the view that “we should all be willing to fight for our country, whether it is right or wrong.” In August 2003, 64% of those over 65 supported this tenet, while barely half (51%) of those under age 30 agreed. This gap has persisted since the late 1980s . Younger age cohorts are not only more likely to be defenders of international agreements but also to express concern about the protection of innocents abroad. Pew’s survey in October did not show obvious generation gaps in the way age groups ranked the importance of such issues as preventing nuclear war, protecting the United States from future terrorist attacks and ensuring adequate energy supplies. But the issue of “Helping improve the living standards in developing nations” was accorded top priority by 38% among those under the age of 30, compared with just 28% of those ages 65 and older, and younger people also place a significantly higher priority on reducing AIDS and other infectious diseases. In this same vein, young people are consistently less likely than older people to subscribe to the view that “most of the countries that have gotten help from America end up resenting us.” This internationalist view extends to trade agreements as well. In October 2005, nearly six-in-ten (58%) young people said that free trade agreements such as NAFTA are a good thing for the country; only 35% of people ages 50-64 and 33% of those over age 65 agreed – a difference observed consistently in surveys since 1997. Younger people also tend to be much more supportive of international trade in general, seeing it as a good thing both for the country and for themselves and their families. In a 2002 Pew survey, 27% of those under 30 said growing trade and business ties with other countries are a very good thing for them personally, whereas only 12% of those over 65 said so. While younger Americans desire a multilateral approach to foreign affairs and are willing to engage military forces more readily to solve a wide range of international problems, their core instinct is to take care of problems at home first. Most (54%) young people agree with the statement “the U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own” – just 42% disagree. By comparison, majorities in all older age groups disagree. Similarly, when given the choice of two governing principles, “It’s best for the future of our country to be active in world affairs” or “We should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems here at home,” younger people prefer to focus on their own country. In 2003, only 39% of those under age 30 thought it best to be active, while 53% of those ages 30-64 and nearly half (49%) of those 65 and older preferred international activism. The foreign policy views of neither younger nor older Americans can be captured in a single word, particularly not by such generalizations as “hawks” or “doves.” The caution that older Americans express on any specific question about sending U.S. troops overseas belies their clear sense that maintaining America’s military strength and superpower status is the best way to keep us – and the rest of the world – safe. The youngest Americans generally prefer effective diplomacy over military strength as the best way to foster peace – but are not notably opposed to using military force in specific circumstances. Who, then, are the hawks and who are the doves? And if the young support international engagement only when problems at home have been addressed first, but want to work with allies through international institutions, while older generations see global affairs as more important but see America’s interests taking priority over international cooperation, who are the isolationists and who are the internationalists? These seeming paradoxes, however, have their own internal logic. For example, it is not necessarily inconsistent to insist that America remain the world’s only superpower and to see military strength as the best way to achieve peace, yet at the same time to be exceedingly cautious about the application of military force – as is the position of many older Americans. Similarly, while younger people believe America’s best approach to foreign policy is through cooperation and compromise, they also see the use of military force as a tool in the foreign policy toolbox – a practical and tough-minded way to achieve a compassionate end. Some of these differences across age groups may be explained by the nature of the life cycle – and as today’s youth grow older their views may take on the characteristics of their seniors today. Some may also reflect generational divides – views that are shaped by the events and experiences they share such as World War II, Vietnam, and the end of the Cold War. Only by tracking their opinions of future conflicts will we be able to see if, as today’s young adults grow older, their ideas about these issues change as did those of their forebears. 1 “The United States and the Use of Force in the Post-Cold War Era,” The Aspen Institute, Queenstown, Maryland: 1995. 2 The consistent generational pattern in views of the Vietnam and Iraq wars stands in stark contrast to an analysis of partisan divides. Partisanship was never a major factor in views of the Vietnam conflict – Gallup surveys show that at the outset majorities in both parties said sending troops was correct, and by the end majorities in both parties said it was a mistake, and the partisan gap never widened beyond 10 percentage point.","Older Americans are more opposed to the use of military force than those in other age groups , but most believe that , in principle , the best way to ensure peace is through military strength rather than effective diplomacy .

A picture emerges from the survey of how people perceive the internet’s impact on their lives, how many people access it and who they are, and what people are doing online. We also looked at smartphone and cell phone ownership rates, as well as the types of activities people do on their mobile devices. Here are five key takeaways from this report, which is based on a survey of 36,619 people from spring 2014: 1People see the internet as a good influence on education, but are skeptical of its effect on morality. Overall, people in the emerging and developing countries surveyed see the internet as having a positive effect on education, personal relationships and the economy. But they are wary about its impact on politics and especially on morality. A median of 42% across 32 countries say that the internet is a bad influence on morality. 2The young, well-educated and English speakers use the internet more frequently. The internet is not pervasive everywhere. In fact, less than half of people in 19 of the 32 countries surveyed say they access the internet at least occasionally or own a smartphone. But young people (18-34 years old), the better educated (secondary or more education) and those who have at least some ability to read and speak English are consistently much more likely than others to be online. 3Across the emerging and developing countries, national income is strongly associated with higher internet access rates. Richer countries in terms of gross domestic product per capita are much more likely to have high rates of internet access, and poorer countries typically have fewer internet users. At some point, however, access in richer countries will max out, providing a chance for poorer nations to close the gap. As of January 2014, 87% of people in the U.S. (a very rich country) use the internet, and many envision a time when universal access will become a reality. 4Among the activities tested among online users, socializing, either with friends or family or by utilizing social networks, is the most popular choice. Meanwhile, getting information, such as political news, health advice or government services, is in the second tier of internet use, but still widespread. Commerce and career activities such as looking for a job, making or receiving payments, buying products and taking an online class are less common. 5Cell phones are nearly universal, but smartphones are less commonplace, at least for now. Nearly everyone in the 32 countries surveyed owns a cell phone (median of 84%). But while the smartphone revolution is in full swing, levels of smartphone penetration are far from universal. Only in two of the countries polled do more than half have a smartphone – 58% in Chile and 55% in China, on par with the 58% of Americans who report owning this kind of device. But as with internet access, the people buying these phones are young and educated, so the movement toward greater smartphone adoption is likely to continue.","People see the internet as a good influence on education , but are skeptical of its effect on morality .

Anti-Americanism is extensive, as it has been for the past five years. At the same time, the image of China has slipped significantly among the publics of other major nations. Opinion about Russia is mixed, but confidence in its president, Vladimir Putin, has declined sharply. In fact, the Russian leader’s negatives have soared to the point that they mirror the nearly worldwide lack of confidence in George W. Bush. Global distrust of American leadership is reflected in increasing disapproval of the cornerstones of U.S. foreign policy. Not only is there worldwide support for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but there also is considerable opposition to U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan. Western European publics are at best divided about keeping troops there. In nearly every predominantly Muslim country, overwhelming majorities want U.S. and NATO troops withdrawn from Afghanistan as soon as possible. In addition, global support for the U.S.-led war on terrorism ebbs ever lower. And the United States is the nation blamed most often for hurting the world’s environment, at a time of rising global concern about environmental issues. At the same time, China’s expanding economic and military power is triggering considerable anxiety. Large majorities in many countries think that China’s growing military might is a bad thing, and the publics of many advanced nations are increasingly concerned about the impact of China’s economic power on their own countries. Russia and its president also are unpopular in many countries of the world. But criticisms of that nation and its leader are sharpest in Western Europe where many citizens worry about overdependence on the Russian energy supply. For instance, despite sharp declines in favorable views of the U.S. in France and Germany since 2002, Russia’s image in those countries is no better. There is little evidence that discontent with the major nations of the world and their leaders is resulting in greater confidence in those who have challenged the global status quo. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez inspires little public confidence, even in Latin America, and huge majorities in most countries also say they have little or no confidence in Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to do the right thing regarding world affairs. There also is broad opposition to Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons. Citizens all around the world voice substantial concern about the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Iran. This includes the Muslim publics of neighboring nations such as Kuwait and Turkey. The Pew survey finds a general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat. Worries have risen sharply in Latin America and Europe, as well as in Japan and India. Many people blame the United States — and to a lesser extent China — for these problems and look to Washington to do something about them. As was the case in Pew’s first major global survey in 2002, global concerns vary significantly by region of the world. The spread of nuclear weapons is a growing worry in the Middle East — it is named as a top global danger in that region, along with religious and ethnic hatreds. AIDS and other infectious diseases continue to be viewed as the dominant threat in Africa and a major concern in Latin America. Yet the polling also finds that African publics are increasingly concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor. In addition, the belief that economic inequality represents a major global danger has become much more prevalent in South Korea and Russia. In the face of strong criticisms of its foreign policy, the U.S. is cited in many countries about as often as the U.N. as the entity that should be responsible for dealing with the problems that confront the world. This is particularly the case among people who are most concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons. But when it comes to AIDS and the gap between rich and poor, many who see these as important threats look to their own countries to provide solutions. Most people in the survey, conducted in 46 countries and the Palestinian territories, have a favorable view of the United Nations. Negative views of the U.N. are most prevalent in the Middle East. Large majorities in both the Palestinian territories (69%) and Israel (58%) express unfavorable opinions of the world body. U.S. opinion of the U.N. remains mixed — 48% have a favorable view, 39% unfavorable. For the most part, global opinion of the European Union parallels opinion of the U.N.; in the U.S. roughly twice as many have a positive view of the EU than a negative one (47% vs. 22%), although many Americans offer no opinion (30%). In the current poll, majorities in 25 of the 47 countries surveyed express positive views of the U.S. Since 2002, however, the image of the United States has declined in most parts of the world. Favorable ratings of America are lower in 26 of 33 countries for which trends are available. The U.S. image remains abysmal in most Muslim countries in the Middle East and Asia, and continues to decline among the publics of many of America’s oldest allies. Favorable views of the U.S. are in single digits in Turkey (9%) and have declined to 15% in Pakistan. Currently, just 30% of Germans have a positive view of the U.S. — down from 42% as recently as two years ago — and favorable ratings inch ever lower in Great Britain and Canada. For all of the bad news, however, the global survey of 47 nations, conducted throughout the world, reveals a more complex picture of opinions of the United States. First, the U.S. image remains positive in Africa. In several African countries, such as Ethiopia and Kenya, it is overwhelmingly positive. In addition, majorities in two of America’s most important Asian trading partners — India and Japan — continue to express favorable opinions of the United States. And the U.S. image has improved dramatically in South Korea since 2003 (from 46% to 58% favorable). While opinion of the U.S. has slipped in Latin America over the past five years, majorities in such countries as Mexico, Peru and even Venezuela still say they have a positive opinion of their large neighbor to the north. Similarly, “new Europe” likes America better than “old Europe,” although the U.S. image is not nearly as strong in Eastern Europe as it was five years ago. And while negative views of the U.S. continue to prevail in much of the Muslim world, anger is not as universal today as it was in the spring of 2003 after the start of the war in Iraq. At that time, just 1% of Jordanians — and less than 1% in the Palestinian territories — gave a favorable rating to the United States, compared with 20% and 13%, respectively, today. And while still far from positive, America’s image has recovered substantially in Lebanon as well. However, opinions of the American people have declined over the past five years in 23 of 33 countries where trends are available. In Indonesia and Turkey, where favorable views of the U.S. have declined markedly over the past five years, opinions of Americans have fallen sharply as well. In Indonesia, positive opinions of Americans have fallen from 65% in 2002 to 42%; in Turkey, favorable opinions have declined 19 points. While opinions of Americans have fallen in most Western European countries, they remain generally positive. In every Western European country surveyed, far more people express positive opinions of Americans than they do of the U.S.; in Germany, for instance, 63% say they have a positive opinion of Americans compared with just 30% who rate the U.S. positively. In fact, in many countries, the American people get better ratings than does the U.S. generally. Latin America is a consistent exception to this rule. In this region, Americans get about the same ratings as their country; either both are mostly favorable, as in Venezuela and Peru, or both are quite low, as in Argentina. This is by far the largest global survey Pew has conducted since 2002. As such, it provides a broad perspective on anti-Americanism, documenting the nature and breadth of negative perceptions of the U.S. Among key U.S. allies in Western Europe, the view that the U.S. acts unilaterally is an opinion that has tracked closely with America’s overall image over the past five years. Ironically, the belief that the United States does not take into account the interests of other countries in formulating its foreign policy is extensive among the publics of several close U.S. allies. No fewer than 89% of the French, 83% of Canadians and 74% of the British express this opinion. U.S. policies also are widely viewed as increasing the gap between rich nations and poor nations. This is even the case in several countries where the U.S. is generally well regarded. In addition, this is one of the few criticisms of the U.S. that is widely shared around the world and with which a plurality of Americans (38%) agree. Critiques of the U.S. are not confined to its policies, however. In much of the world there is broad and deepening dislike of American values and a global backlash against the spread of American ideas and customs. Majorities or pluralities in most countries surveyed say they dislike American ideas about democracy — and this sentiment has increased in most regions since 2002. However, sizable majorities in most African nations — as well as in Israel, South Korea and Japan — continue to express positive views of the U.S. approach to democracy. In addition, a small plurality in China says they like rather than dislike American ideas about democracy (48% to 36%). Public rejection of American democracy in most countries may in part reflect opinions about the way in which the United States has implemented its pro-democracy agenda, as well as America’s democratic values. Majorities in 43 of 47 countries surveyed — including 63% in the United States — say that the U.S. promotes democracy mostly where it serves its interests, rather than promoting it wherever it can. The poll also finds negative attitudes toward American ways of doing business. Dislike of the U.S. approach has deepened. However, Muslim countries in the Middle East are a notable exception, despite their generally poor opinion of the U.S. As many as 71% of Kuwaitis, 63% of Lebanese, and even 40% of Palestinians say they like the American way of doing business. But the greatest admirers of the American approach to business continue to be in Africa, where huge majorities in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria endorse it. While many around the world fault American ideals, there is still considerable admiration for U.S. technology and a strong appetite for its cultural exports. In 42 of 46 foreign countries surveyed, majorities say they admire U.S. technological and scientific advances. In Russia, however, a majority (53%) says nyet to American scientific achievements. Similarly, in most parts of the world, majorities report liking American music, movies and television. However, there is greater dissent with regard to these pop culture exports; majorities in several predominantly Muslim countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, say they dislike American music, movies and television. Indians and Russians also express negative views of U.S. cultural exports. Despite near universal admiration for U.S. technology and a strong appetite for its cultural exports in most parts of the world, large proportions in most countries think it is bad that American ideas and customs are spreading to their countries. The percentage expressing disapproval has increased in many countries since 2002 — including Great Britain (by 17 percentage points), Germany (14 points) and Canada (13 points). Israel, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria are the only countries (aside from the U.S.) in which majorities say they like the spread of American customs. As noted, however, the U.S. is not alone in drawing the increasing ire of people in other countries. The poll also finds flagging views of China, an emerging superpower. Favorable views of China have fallen in Western Europe — particularly in Spain, Germany and France. And while China’s image is generally positive in Asia, it has grown somewhat more negative in India and much more negative in Japan, where unfavorable opinions of China now outnumber positive ones by more than two-to-one (67%-29%). Opinion of China’s growing economic power is decidedly negative in Western Europe, where nearly two- thirds of Italians and the French believe this trend is bad for their country. Only in Sweden is there a positive view of this development. The polling also finds concern about China’s economic clout in Mexico, Czech Republic, South Korea and India. In sharp contrast, the publics of the African nations surveyed give thumbs up to China’s economic power. Majorities or pluralities in the 10 African countries surveyed believe that China has at least a fair amount of influence on their countries. Most people in the African countries surveyed also say that the U.S. has considerable influence; however, U.S. influence is rivaled or exceeded by China’s in a number of African countries, including Mali and Ivory Coast. Similarly, many people in Latin America believe that China is having an important influence on their countries. While China’s perceived impact in this region is not as great as that of the U.S., majorities in Venezuela and Chile, and half of Mexicans, say China’s influence is growing. In general, Africans are more positive than Latin Americans about the growing influence of both China and the U.S. on their countries. But in both regions, somewhat greater percentages say China’s influence is a good thing than say that about U.S. influence.","A 47 - nation survey finds global public opinion increasingly wary of the world ’s dominant nations and disapproving of their leaders .

Majorities across all demographic and partisan groups – including men and women in both parties – hold this view. Overall, two-thirds of Americans (66%) say the recent allegations “mainly reflect widespread problems in society,” compared with just 28% attributing them mainly to individual misconduct, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 4 among 1,503 adults. Women are more likely than men (71% vs. 60%) to see allegations of sexual misconduct as mainly reflective of broad societal problems. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (70%) are also somewhat more likely to say this than Republicans and Republican leaners (61%). Among Republicans and leaners, women are more likely than men to say the recent allegations reflect widespread problems in society – 69% of GOP women say this, compared with 54% of Republican men. Gender differences among Democrats are more modest (74% of Democratic women see the allegations as a societal problem vs. 66% of Democratic men). Among all Americans, women college graduates stand out for their belief that the reports of sexual harassment represent widespread problems in society. An 86% majority of women who have at least a four-year degree express this view – higher than the shares of male college graduates (67%) and women and men with lower levels of education. The recent flood of reports about sexual harassment and violence by high-profile men in fields ranging from entertainment to politics have resonated with the public. More than nine-in-ten (92%) have heard at least a little about alleged harassment and assault by prominent men in entertainment, politics and the media and 74% say they have heard “a lot.” The public overwhelmingly sees the issue of sexual assault and harassment as very important for the country. About three-quarters of the public (74%) say it is “very important” for the country. Among five current issues tested, only proposed changes to the federal tax system rank as important as sexual assault and harassment in the public’s view. Democrats and Democratic leaners are 20 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to view the issue of sexual assault and harassment as very important. Nevertheless, nearly nine-in-ten Republicans (87%) say it is at least somewhat important. Very few Republicans or Democrats regard this issue as not important. More women than men say the issue of sexual assault and harassment is very important. And adults younger than 30 are more likely to view this issue as very important than are people 50 and older.

But they lag behind the general public on some measures of voter engagement, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys. Overall, 52% of Latino registered voters say they have given the coming November election “quite a lot” of thought, a 16-percentage-point increase from what they said about the last midterm election in 2014. In addition, a majority (55%) of Latino registered voters in 2018 say they are more enthusiastic about voting compared with previous congressional elections, up from 37% in 2014. However, Hispanic voters are less likely than all U.S. voters to say they know about the congressional candidates in their district (47% vs. 59%, respectively). Also, one-third of Hispanic voters (33%) say “voting by people like me doesn’t really affect how government runs things,” while 25% of all U.S. voters say this. (Among those eligible to vote but not registered, 53% of Hispanics and 47% of the general public say the same.) More than 29 million Hispanics are eligible to vote, a new high, up 4 million from 2014. (Eligible voters are U.S. citizens ages 18 years and older.) However, Hispanic voter turnout has long trailed that of other groups. In 2014, an estimated 27% of Hispanic eligible voters cast a ballot, a record low and far below the turnout rate among black voters (41%) and white voters (46%). This year’s election comes at a time when most Latinos have grown dissatisfied with the nation’s direction and have more concerns about their place in American society. They also overwhelmingly disapprove of the president’s performance and see his administration’s policies as harmful to Latinos. Even so, not all Latinos feel the same way. Latino Republicans are generally more upbeat than Latino Democrats on these measures. Similar shares of both groups say they have given quite a lot of thought to the upcoming election and say they are more enthusiastic to vote than in previous congressional elections. Hispanic registered voters affiliate with the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a more than two-to-one margin. About six-in-ten Hispanic voters (62%) identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, compared with 27% who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party. These shares have remained steady since the last midterm election. The party affiliation of Latino registered voters mirrors how they intend to vote in the congressional elections, according to a September survey. If the election for Congress were being held today, 63% of Latino registered voters said they would support the Democratic congressional candidate in their district, while 29% said they would support the Republican candidate. About half (48%) of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party has more concern for Latinos than the Republican Party, while a third (32%) say there is no difference between the parties and 14% say the Republican Party has more concern. However, the Democratic Party has lost ground since 2016. The share of Hispanic registered voters who say Democrats have more concern for Hispanics than Republicans has declined in recent years after reaching a recent high of 59% in 2015. Meanwhile, the share of Hispanic voters who see no difference between parties is up, from 22% in 2015 to 32% today. A higher share of Latino Democratic voters say their party is more concerned for Latinos, compared with the share of Latino Republican voters who say the same about their own party. About seven-in-ten Latino Democratic voters (72%) say the Democratic Party has more concern, while 24% say there is no difference. Fewer than half (45%) of Latino Republican voters say the Republican Party has more concern for Latinos, while 40% say there is no difference between the parties.","The party affiliation of Latino registered voters mirrors how they intend to vote in the congressional elections , according to a September survey .

Roughly half say being a working parent makes it harder for them to be a good parent, and about as many say that at times they feel they can’t give 100% at work. Despite these challenges, many working parents – including about eight-in-ten full-time working mothers – say their current employment situation is what’s best for them at this point in their life, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. A majority (55%) of U.S. mothers with children younger than 18 at home are employed full time, up from 34% a half-century ago, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau Current Population Survey data. The rise in full-time employment has fueled the overall rise in employment among moms: Now, 72% of moms are employed, either full time or part time, compared with about half in 1968. Among fathers with kids in the home, the vast majority (89%) are employed full time. About half of employed parents with children younger than 18 – including similar shares of mothers (53%) and fathers (51%) – say being a working parent makes it harder for them to be a good parent. But employed moms (50%) are more likely than employed dads (39%) to say being a working parent makes it harder for them to advance in their job or career. Among working mothers, those who are employed part time (57%) are more likely than those who work full time (47%) to say being a working parent makes it harder for them to advance in their job or career. At the same time, full-time working moms are more likely to say being a working parent makes it harder for them to be a good parent (57% vs. 44% of part-time working moms). There aren’t enough part-time working fathers with children younger than 18 in the household in the sample to analyze separately. When asked about some specific challenges they may have faced at work because they were balancing work and parenting responsibilities, about half of working mothers say they’ve needed to reduce their work hours (54%) or that they’ve felt like they couldn’t give 100% at work (51%). Smaller but still substantial shares of working fathers say the same: About four-in-ten say they’ve needed to reduce their work hours (44%) or that they couldn’t give 100% (43%). About one-in-five working parents, including 23% of working moms and 15% of working dads, say they have turned down a promotion because they were balancing work and parenting responsibilities. Roughly a quarter of working parents (23%) say they have been treated as if they weren’t committed to their work because they have children, while 17% say they have been passed over for an important assignment. In addition, 16% say they have been passed over for a promotion for this reason. Mothers are more likely than fathers to say they’ve had each of these experiences. Still, most parents with children younger than 18 say it would be best for them personally to be employed, either full time or part time, at this point in their life. Among fathers, 82% say it would be best for them to be working full time; 11% say it would be best to be working part time and just 7% say it would be best to not be working for pay at all. Views are more varied among mothers: 51% say it would be best for them to be working full time, 30% say part-time work would be best and 19% say the optimal arrangement for them would be not to work for pay at all right now. Mothers across income groups express similar views of what would be best for them at this point in their life. Among full-time working mothers, 84% say their current employment situation is what’s best for them at the moment, while 14% say working part time would be best and just 2% say not working for pay at all would be best. About half of part-time working moms (54%) say working part time is best for them at this point in their life, but a sizable share (33%) say working full time would be best and 14% say not working for pay at all would be best. And among stay-at-home moms, 39% say not working for pay at all is what’s best for them, but a similar share (35%) say it would be best for them to be working part time; a quarter of mothers who are not employed say it would be best for them to be working full time. When asked more generally about the ideal situation for men and women with young children – rather than about what works best for them personally – about three-quarters of U.S. adults (76%) say working full time is ideal for fathers, while just 33% think this is the ideal situation for mothers. About four-in-ten (42%) say working part time is ideal for women with young children, while 21% say not working for pay at all is ideal for this group. About a third of women (33%) and men (32%) say working full time is ideal for mothers; 44% of women say working part time is ideal (vs. 40% of men), while 19% (vs. 23% of men) say not working for pay at all is ideal. The view that working full time is ideal for women with young children is more common among black adults: 57% say this, compared with 38% of Hispanic and 27% of white adults. Just 8% of black adults say not working for pay at all is the ideal situation for mothers; 25% of whites and 15% of Hispanics say the same. Across age groups, similar shares of those ages 18 to 29 (35%), 30 to 49 (37%) and 50 to 64 (35%) say working full time is the ideal situation for women with young children; 21% of those ages 65 and older agree. Three-in-ten in the oldest group say not working for pay at all is ideal for mothers, compared with about two-in-ten of those ages 30 to 49 (20%) and 50 to 64 (21%) and 14% of those younger than 30. Among full-time working mothers, 45% say working full time is ideal for women with young children, while a similar share (41%) say working part time is ideal and 11% say the ideal is for women with young children to not work for pay at all. Part-time working moms are more likely to say working part time is ideal for women with young children (53%) than to say working full time (27%) or not at all (16%) are ideal. Among stay-at-home moms, a plurality (42%) say working part time is ideal for women with young children, while similar shares say working full time (27%) or not working for pay at all (28%) is ideal.

They believe that involvement in the global economy is good for the country and that Japan should help other nations, particularly developing ones, deal with their problems. After years of stagnating growth and start-stop economic recoveries, just three-in-ten Japanese believe economic conditions in their country are good, down 7 percentage points from last year. And roughly a third of the Japanese say Japan plays a less important role today than it did a decade ago. Nevertheless, nearly six-in-ten say international trade and investment is good for Japan because it creates new market opportunities and boosts growth. Roughly the same share of the public believes that Japan needs to assist other nations with their problems. Majorities want to increase investment in, trade with, and foreign aid to developing countries. And about half say Japan should take its allies’ concerns into account when making Japanese foreign policy. Yet Japanese embrace of the world has its limits. Despite quite negative views of China and the threat China’s emergence as a world power poses for Japan, the Japanese overwhelmingly reject a more robust military role for their country in the Asia-Pacific region. There is little support for more military spending, and the Japanese oppose using overwhelming military force to defeat terrorism. Moreover, the Japanese, like Europeans and Americans, are exclusionary in their view of national identity. For a person to be considered truly Japanese, around nine-in-ten believe that a person has to speak Japanese and share Japanese customs and traditions; nearly eight-in-ten say he or she must be born in Japan. And while a majority of the Japanese public maintains a favorable view of their longtime ally the United States, roughly half see U.S. power and influence as a major threat to Japan. An even larger share of the population (61%) sees America in decline, a harsher judgment of the U.S. than is found in China. These are among the key findings from a new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted among 1,000 respondents in Japan from April 26 to May 29, 2016. Among some of the leading nations of the world, the Japanese are the most likely to voice the view that their nation should help other countries deal with their problems: 59% of Japanese take this outward-looking stance compared with just 37% of Americans, a median of 40% across 10 EU nations and only 23% in India and 22% in China. The Japanese (58%) share with the Chinese (60%) and the Europeans (56%) a view that engagement with the global economy is good for their country. Only 44% of Americans hold that opinion. But the Japanese (24%) are far less likely than the Chinese (75%) and Indians (68%) to believe that their country has a more important role in the world today than it did 10 years ago. In this regard, Japanese sentiment is more like that shared in Europe (23%) and the U.S. (21%). Moreover, the Japanese public, less involved in the war on terror than their counterparts in other major nations surveyed, has far less faith in the use of military force to defeat terrorism. Japan has been on a long, dispiriting journey since the heady days of the late 1980s, when Japan’s economy was growing by leaps and bounds. The country has endured two and a half decades of anemic growth, averaging just 1.08% since 1990, according to the World Bank. Just 30% of the public believes the economy is in good shape; 68% believe the current economic situation is bad. The share that says things are good is down 7 percentage points from 2015. However, this gloomy perception needs to be seen in historical perspective. As recently as 2012, just 7% gave the economy a thumbs-up. Nevertheless, the Japanese are divided on the how things in general are going in the country: 47% are satisfied and 45% are dissatisfied. Satisfaction is up significantly from 34% in 2014. And, notably, contentment with the country’s direction today is higher than at any time since the Pew Research Center first asked the question in 2002. Those with more than a secondary school education (57%) are more likely to say things are going well than those with a secondary education or less (41%). Nearly four years into his second stint in office, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe draws generally positive, if somewhat muted, reviews. Roughly half the public (52%) approves of his handling of the economy, while 39% disapprove. Nearly three-quarters (74%) give a positive grade to Abe’s handling of relations with the United States. And more than half (54%) back his dealings with South Korea, while about a third (34%) disapprove. The public is less supportive of Abe’s handling of relations with China (46% approve, 40% disapprove). Men (58%) are more supportive than women (46%) of Abe’s handling of the economy. There is a 13-percentage-point difference in views between men (81%) and women (68%) about the prime minister’s handling of relations with the U.S. Japanese with more than a high school education are more supportive (53%) than those with a high school education or less (42%) of Abe’s dealings with China. And there is a similar division in views about his relations with South Korea (62% support from more highly educated Japanese, 50% from the less educated). The Japanese public sees cybersecurity, ISIS and climate change as the biggest threats to their country. About seven-in-ten Japanese (71%) say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to Japan. Roughly the same share of the public (69%) believes the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS represents a major threat. And a similar number (68%) cite global climate change as a major problem. Notably, it is older Japanese (75% of those ages 50 and older), not younger ones (59% ages 18 to 34), who are the most worried about global warming. Despite widespread antipathy toward Beijing, a smaller share of the public (63%) names China’s emergence as a world power as a major threat to Japan. And despite a largely favorable view of the United States, roughly half the Japanese public (52%) also names U.S. power and influence as a major international challenge for Japan. Young Japanese (63%), those ages 18 to 34, are more likely than those ages 50 and older (47%) to see the U.S. as a threat. Japan has the third-largest economy in the world, trailing only the United States and China. Its military does not rival that of the U.S, China and Russia, but ranks prominently among the second tier of strategic powers. And Japan is the fifth-largest exporter in the world. But the Japanese public has a mixed view of the trajectory of Japan’s role in the world. Only about a quarter (24%) believes Japan plays a more important role in the world today compared with 10 years ago. About a third (34%) says Japan plays a less important role. And 39% hold the view that Japan’s role is about as important today as it was a decade ago. (In comparison, 21% of Americans and 75% of Chinese think their country is more important.) Despite this uncertainty about their country’s place on the world stage, the Japanese are outward looking. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) say Japan should help other nations deal with their problems. This is a greater sense of public commitment to the rest of the world than in any of the other major nations surveyed in 2016. And a majority of Japanese also held such sentiment in Pew Research Center surveys conducted in both 2010 and 2011. Only about a third of the public (35%) believes that Japan should deal with its own challenges and let others deal with their own problems. Men (64%) more than women (55%) back Japan helping others, as do those with a high school education or more (64%) compared with those with a secondary education or less (56%). In one indicator of their commitment to help others, 73% of Japanese believe that Japanese companies should increase their investment in developing nations. Just 19% oppose such business activity. Roughly as many Japanese (71%) support importing more goods from developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Again, only a fifth of the public opposes such commercial help for poor nations. And 66% of Japanese back increasing foreign aid to developing countries, while 27% oppose boosting such assistance. (Currently, Japan commits 0.22% of its gross national income to foreign aid, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By comparison, the U.S. donates 0.17% and the UK 0.71%.) Notably, Japanese men (74%) are more likely than women (58%) to support increased foreign aid for developing countries.) In its conduct of foreign policy, roughly half (48%) of Japanese voice the view that Japan should take into account the interests of its allies, even if it means making compromises. Only 40% believe that Japan should follow its own national interests in international affairs, even when its allies strongly disagree. With regard to the goals of that foreign policy, roughly six-in-ten (62%) say improving human rights is important, but many other foreign policy objectives should be more important. Just 29% believe that improving human rights around the world should be one of Japan’s most important foreign policy goals. And only 3% dismiss human rights as a national foreign policy aim. More than one-third of the Japanese economy is accounted for by imports and exports of goods and services. And the Japanese public backs such global economic engagement. A majority (58%) believes that it is a good thing for Japan to be economically involved with the world because it provides the nation with new markets and opportunities for growth. Just a third (32%) say such engagement is a bad thing because it lowers wages and costs Japan jobs. Japanese with more than a high school education are more likely (67%) than those with a high school education or less (52%) to say involvement in the global economy is good for Japan. But the Japanese are under no illusion that they are the world’s leading economy. Just 6% of Japanese believe their country is the world’s economic superpower. Fully 61% say the leader is the United States, while 24% name China. The exercise of military force has been controversial in Japan since World War II. The Japanese Constitution outlaws war as a means for the state to settle international disputes. A majority (62%) of Japanese say Japan should limit its military role in the Asia-Pacific region. Just 29% voice the view that Japan should play a more active military role in regional affairs. Notably, support for a more active military role is up 6 percentage points since 2015. Among the minority of Japanese who believe Japan should take on more military responsibilities, men (36%) are more likely than women (22%) to hold this view. The Japanese public’s reluctance to endorse the use of military force can also be seen in their concern about how to defeat terrorism around the world. Nearly seven-in-ten Japanese (69%) see ISIS as a major threat. Yet roughly eight-in-ten (79%) believe that relying too much on military force will create hatred that leads to more terrorism. Only 14% back using overwhelming military force as the best way to defeat international terrorism. Japan spends roughly 1% of its economy on defense. But only 29% of the public wants to increase such outlays. About half (52%) favor keeping military spending the same. And 14% want to see the government decrease military expenditures. Among the minority of Japanese who want to increase defense spending, it is men more than women. Roughly seven-in-ten Japanese (72%) have a favorable view of the United States. Such sentiment is roughly consistent with Japanese public opinion about America going back a decade. Only in 2011, after U.S. aid in response to the tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident, did Japanese support for the U.S. briefly spike (85%). Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time ally’s trajectory on the world stage. About six-in-ten (61%) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago. Just 7% believe the U.S. plays a more important role, while 29% say Washington is as important as a decade ago. Such Japanese sentiment about a longtime ally is striking: Only 39% of the Chinese see the U.S. as less important than before. Japanese ages 50 and older (67%) are more likely than those ages 18 to 34 (51%) to believe that the United States plays a less important role on the world stage today, as do men (66%) more than women (57%) and Japanese with more than a high school education (70%) compared with those with a high school education or less (56%). Nevertheless, the Japanese retain confidence (78%) in U.S. President Barack Obama to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Japanese support for the American chief executive has been strong throughout his presidency. Seven-in-ten Japanese also express confidence in Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, much more faith in her than they had when she last ran for president in 2008 (47%). Only 9% of Japanese have confidence in Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. An overwhelming 82% express no confidence. The Japanese are not nearly as positive about China, their most powerful Asian neighbor. Roughly one-in-ten (11%) hold a favorable view of China, while 86% express an unfavorable opinion, including 42% who are very unfavorable. This was not always the case: In 2002, 55% of Japanese had a positive view of China. Current anti-Chinese sentiment is also reflected in the fact that just 12% have confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping. Such negative views of China and its leader may be one manifestation of Japanese fears of a military confrontation with China. Eight-in-ten Japanese believe that territorial disputes between China and its neighbors could lead to a military conflict. Nevertheless, the Japanese are divided on how best to deal with their superpower neighbor. In thinking about relations with China, 47% say having a strong economic relationship is the most important thing to do, while 45% believe the best way forward is to be tough on territorial disputes between Japan and China. Japanese views of South Korea are little better: Just 27% voice a favorable view, down from 56% in 2006. Today, 68% of Japanese hold an unfavorable opinion of South Korea, including one-in-four who have a very unfavorable view. Japanese have long held a much higher opinion of India. More than half (54%) have a favorable view of the South Asian nation. Notably, around one-in-five Japanese voice no opinion about India. At least half of Japanese have been positively disposed toward India for the last decade, but the current approval is down from its peak of 70% in 2012. Japan is not a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a consequence of having been on the losing side in World War II. But the Abe government aspires to such a seat. At the same time, Japanese public support for the United Nations is down after peaking in 2011. Just 45% of Japanese hold a favorable view of the UN today; in 2011, 61% viewed the UN favorably. Younger Japanese (55%) have a more positive opinion of the UN than older Japanese (44%).","In one indicator of their commitment to help others , 73 % of Japanese believe that Japanese companies should increase their investment in developing nations .

Sometimes they mark a new milestone in public opinion; other times a sudden about-face. From an increase in Americans living without a spouse or partner to the impact of Donald Trump’s presidency, here are 17 findings that stood out to us in 2017: 1Partisan divides dwarf demographic differences on key political values. The average gap between the views of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents across 10 political values has increased from 15 percentage points in 1994 to 36 points today. Two decades ago, the average partisan differences on these items were only slightly wider than differences by religious attendance or educational attainment, and about as wide as differences across racial lines. Today, the partisan gaps far exceed differences across other key demographics. 2Donald Trump’s presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States. A global median of just 22% have confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs, according to a survey conducted last spring. The image of the U.S. abroad also suffered a decline: Just 49% have a favorable view, down from 64% at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency. 3About four-in-ten Americans say they live in a gun-owning household, while three-in-ten say they personally own a gun. Protection tops the list of reasons for owning a gun. And most gun owners (74%) say the right to own a firearm is essential to their personal sense of freedom. About three-quarters (73%) say they can’t see themselves ever not owning a gun. Gun ownership is more common among men, whites and those who live in rural areas. Gun owners and non-owners have starkly different views on gun violence in America. While a majority of those who do not own guns (59%) see gun violence as a major problem in the country today, just one-third of adults who own guns say this is a very big problem. 4Democrats and Republicans disagree now more than ever on the news media’s “watchdog” role. Roughly nine-in-ten Democrats say news media criticism keeps political leaders from doing things that shouldn’t be done, compared with 42% of Republicans ­who say this – the widest gap in Pew Research Center surveys conducted since 1985. This stands in stark contrast to early 2016, when similar shares of Democrats (74%) and Republicans (77%) supported the media’s watchdog role. 5Muslims are projected to be the world’s fastest-growing major religious group in the decades ahead. By 2035, the number of babies born to Muslims is projected to modestly exceed births to Christians, mostly due to Muslims’ relatively young population and high fertility rates. The Muslim population in Europe, now accounting for 4.9% of the total population, is projected to continue to rise. Even if there is no new migration in the coming decades (an unlikely scenario), the Muslim share of the region’s population is expected to increase to 7.4% by 2050. 6In the U.S., Hispanic identity fades across generations as distance from immigrant roots grows. High intermarriage rates and declining immigration are changing how some Americans with Hispanic ancestry see their identity. Most U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry self-identify as Hispanic, but 11%, or 5 million, do not. While nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain say they are Hispanic, this share decreases by the third and fourth or higher generations. 7Americans see fundamental differences between men and women, but men and women have different views on the cause of these differences. Majorities of women who see gender differences in the way people express their feelings, excel at work and approach parenting say differences between men and women are mostly based on societal expectations. Men who see differences in these areas tend to believe biology is the root. 8Many Americans expect certain professions to be dominated by automation in their lifetime – but few see their own jobs at risk. Roughly three-quarters of Americans think it’s realistic that robots and computers might one day do many jobs currently done by humans, and sizable majorities expect jobs such as fast food workers and insurance claims processors to be performed by machines within their lifetimes. Yet just 30% of American workers expect their own jobs or professions to become automated. 9The share of Republicans who hold negative views of the effect of colleges and universities on the country has grown significantly since 2015. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (58%) now say colleges have a negative effect. Two years ago, by contrast, 54% of Republicans said colleges were having a positive effect. Democrats and Democratic leaners have consistently held positive views of the effect of colleges on the U.S.; 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say this today. Republicans also have “cooler” feelings toward college professors than do Democrats. On a “feeling thermometer” ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the coldest rating and 100 is the warmest, Republicans give college professors an average rating of 46. By contrast, Democrats give them a far warmer average rating of 71. 10Immigrants are projected to play the primary role in the growth of the American working-age population in the coming decades. The number of working-age immigrants is projected to increase from 33.9 million in 2015 to 38.5 million by 2035, with new immigrant arrivals accounting for all of that gain. Absent these new arrivals, the total projected U.S. working-age population would fall. 11News stories about President Trump’s first 60 days in office offered far more negative assessments than they did of prior administrations. About six-in-ten stories on Trump’s early days in office had a negative assessment, about three times more than in early coverage for Obama and roughly twice that of Bush and Clinton. Coverage of Trump’s early time in office moved further away from a focus on the policy agenda and more toward character and leadership. 12In the past 10 years, the share of U.S. adults living without a spouse or partner has increased. This rise in “unpartnered” Americans, from 39% in 2007 to 42% today, has been most pronounced among young adults: Roughly six-in-ten adults younger than 35 are now living without a spouse or partner. The share of “unpartnered” adults also has risen more sharply among those who are not employed. 13About half of 2.2 million people who sought asylum in Europe during the 2015 and 2016 refugee surge were still in limbo at the end of 2016 and did not know if they would be allowed to stay. Among Europe’s asylum seekers waiting on decisions as of the end of 2016, an estimated two-thirds had not had a decision made on their case – and another third (about 385,000) were appealing their first decision after being rejected. For asylum seekers from certain countries, the share waiting was much higher than the share approved. For example, an estimated 89% of Albanian applicants between 2015 and 2016 were waiting to know their status in Europe at the end of 2016. 14About eight-in-ten Americans say they understand the risks and challenges of police work, but 86% of police say the public does not understand. This is one of several areas where the views of police and those of the public diverge significantly. For example, while half of the public says the country still needs to make changes to give blacks equal rights with whites, this view is shared by just 16% of police. Law enforcement officers and the public are broadly in agreement on other issues, such as making private gun sales and gun show sales subject to background checks. 15About six-in-ten Americans ages 18 to 29 say the primary way they watch television now is with streaming services on the internet. Much smaller shares of older Americans cite online streaming services as their primary way of watching TV; older Americans tend to rely on cable connections. Overall, just 28% of Americans cite streaming services as the primary way they watch TV. 16Views on whether whites benefit from societal advantages that blacks do not have are split sharply along racial and partisan lines. Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (78%) say white people benefit at least a fair amount from advantages that blacks do not have. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 72% say whites do not benefit much or at all from these advantages. An overwhelming majority of blacks (92%) say whites benefit from societal advantages, while just 46% of whites say the same. 17Science knowledge is closely related to expectations for harm from climate change among Democrats, but not among Republicans. In 2016, Democrats with high science knowledge were far more likely than Democrats with low science knowledge to say a series of environmental impacts would be very likely to occur as a result of climate change, including rising sea levels and intensifying storms. But there are only modest or no differences among Republicans with different levels of science knowledge in their expectations of harm to the Earth’s ecosystems. Almost all Democrats with high knowledge about science say climate change is mostly due to human activity (93%); a much smaller share of Democrats with low science knowledge (49%) say the same. Among Republicans, there are no significant differences by science knowledge about the causes of climate change.","About half of 2.2 million people who sought asylum in Europe during the 2015 and 2016 refugee surge were still in limbo at the end of 2016 and did not know if they would be allowed to stay .

Voters say the GOP could do a better job than the Democrats on the economy, and the Republicans hold double-digit advantages on both terrorism and the budget deficit. However, the Democrats have advantages on a number of qualities and traits – from honesty to empathy and a willingness to compromise. And on some dimensions, the Republican Party is viewed less positively by voters than it was just prior to the 2010 election, when it captured the House. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Oct. 15-20 among 2,003 adults, including 1,494 registered voters, finds that neither party is especially popular with voters as they head into the midterms. The GOP’s favorable ratings are underwater: 39% of registered voters view the party favorably, while 55% have an unfavorable impression. Favorable ratings for the Democratic Party, while better than the GOP’s, are hardly robust: As many voters view the party unfavorably (48%) as favorably (47%). This year’s elections, like the previous two midterms, will take place against a backdrop of deep public dissatisfaction with national conditions. Just 29% of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country; more than twice as many (65%) are dissatisfied. That is on par with levels of dissatisfaction before the 2010 and 2006 midterms. Views of the nation’s economy are far less gloomy than they were four years ago; nonetheless, ratings for the economy remain highly negative, with 78% saying conditions are only fair or poor. Voter frustration with members of Congress is currently even higher than it was 2010 or 2006. Fully 68% of registered voters say they do not want to see most members of Congress reelected – 14 points higher than in 2010 and 19 points higher than in 2006. And roughly a third (35%) say they do not want their own representative reelected, compared with 32% four years ago and 26% eight years ago. Yet unlike in those elections, when a single party controlled both the House and Senate, anti-incumbent sentiment now crosses party lines. Republican and Democratic voters are about equally likely to oppose the reelection of most representatives and their own member of Congress. As has been the case all year, Republican voters are substantially more engaged in the election than are Democratic voters. And on several measures, the GOP’s advantage is about as great as it was four years ago: Currently, 68% of those who support the Republican candidate in their district have given a lot of thought to the election, compared with 54% who support the Democratic candidate. More Republican than Democratic voters say they are following news about the election very closely (35% vs. 25%). And, as was the case in October 2010, more Republican voters than Democratic voters say they will definitely vote in the election (77% vs. 70%). Despite major events over the past few months – including the emerging threat from the Ebola virus and the military strikes by the United States against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, Barack Obama’s job rating among the public has been little changed. Currently, 43% approve of the job Obama is doing as president, while 51% disapprove. Obama had virtually the same job rating in early September (42%) and at the start of the year (43% in January). Obama continues to be a factor – a negative factor, on balance – for many voters. Currently, 32% of registered voters say they think of their vote for Congress as a vote against Obama, while 20% see it as a vote for Obama; 45% of voters say Obama will not be a factor in their decision. Obama’s impact was more neutral in the latter stages of the campaign four years ago: in mid-October 2010, 30% thought of their vote as “against” Obama, 27% as “for” him and 39% said Obama was not a factor in their vote. Support for Obama is driving the vote of fewer Democrats today than in 2010. In the current survey, 38% of voters who plan to support the Democratic candidate in their district say they consider their vote as “for” Obama. Four years ago, far more Democratic voters (53%) said this. By contrast, a much larger share of Republicans say they consider their vote as a vote against Obama, and they are at least as likely to say this as they were in 2010. Fully 61% of Republican voters consider their congressional ballot as a vote against the president, up slightly from 56% in 2010. The percentage of Republican voters who consider their vote for Congress as a vote against the president (61%) is comparable to the percentage of Democratic voters in 2006 who considered their vote for Congress as a vote against second-term Republican President George W. Bush (66%). Both Republican and Democratic voters will head to the polls this November with the balance of power in Congress on their minds. Overall, about equal percentages of those who plan to vote for the Republican candidate in their district and those who plan to vote for the Democratic candidate say the issue of which party controls Congress will be a factor in their vote (67% vs. 64%). In this regard, 2014 differs from the wave elections of both 2010 and 2006. Four years ago, ahead of the GOP winning a majority in the House of Representatives, more Republican (69%) than Democratic (61%) voters said party control would matter in their midterm vote. In 2006, on the eve of a Democratic takeover of the House, the reverse was true, with more Democratic (71%) than Republican (60%) voters saying party control would be a factor in their decision. However, while majorities of both Republican and Democratic view partisan control of Congress as a factor, the specifics of which parties control the House and Senate continue to be a mystery for many voters. Overall, 60% of registered voters know that Republicans control the House, while 58% are aware that Democrats control the Senate. Fewer than half of voters (43%) answered both questions correctly. Notably, awareness of which parties have majorities in the House and Senate has not changed since March (45% knew In another sign that Republican voters are more engaged than Democrats in the 2014 election, Republicans (51%) are more likely than Democrats (40%) to know the majority party in both the House and Senate. The partisan gap in awareness is primarily the result of Republicans’ greater knowledge that the Democrats have the majority in the Senate: 68% of Republican voters know this, compared with 53% of Democrats. There is no partisan difference in knowledge of GOP control of the House (62% of Republicans and 63% of Democrats). Heading into the 2014 midterms, the GOP has an advantage on several key issues—and the overall landscape looks very similar to the fall of 2010. As in 2010, voters give the Republican Party a wide advantage over the Democratic Party on who can do a better job of handling the terrorist threat at home (47% say the GOP vs. 30% saying the Democratic Party) and the deficit (48% vs. 33%). And voters’ views of which party could better handle foreign policy, immigration, and health care are also little changed from 2010. Today, neither party has a significant edge on these issues. Republicans hold a narrow advantage when it comes to the economy, which continues to be the top issue for voters: 44% say the Republican Party can do the better job handling the economy, while 38% say the Democratic Party could do the better job. On the handling of abortion and contraception policies, more voters say the Democratic Party is better able to handle these issues, giving them a nine point advantage over the GOP (46% vs. 37%). Since taking control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2010 midterms, the Republican Party has lost ground to the Democratic Party on several key traits. In Oct. 2010, the Democrats held an 11-point lead over the GOP (47% to 36%) as the party “more concerned with needs of people like me.” Today, the Democrats lead 54% to 33%. And four years ago the parties ran about even on who “governs in a more honest and ethical way,” while today Democrats hold an eight point advantage (41% to 33%). In Oct. 2010, the GOP was seen as the party better able to manage the federal government by an eight point margin, and today the two parties are virtually tied: 42% of voters say the Republican Party, 39% say Democratic Party. Among negative traits and characteristics, by wide margins, the Republican Party is seen as the party “more influenced by lobbyists and special interests” (46% vs. 32%) and “more extreme in its positions” (52% vs. 36%). And voters overwhelming see the Democratic Party as more willing to work with the other party (50% vs. 28%). Only about four-in-ten Americans (38%) say they have a favorable view of the Republican Party, while a 54% majority express an unfavorable view of the GOP. The public remains divided in views of the Democratic Party: 47% have a favorable opinion and 46% have an unfavorable view. Favorable ratings for both parties have changed very little over the past year. Comparable percentages of Democrats (85%) and Republicans (81%) view their own party favorably, and members of both parties give very low ratings to the opposing party. More independents have a favorable impression of the Democratic Party (41%) than the Republican Party (33%). Throughout the 2014 campaign, voters have expressed high levels of anti-incumbent sentiment. Today, about two-thirds (68%) say they do not want most members of Congress reelected this year, while just 23% would like most representatives to win reelection. And roughly a third (35%) say they would not like to see their own representative reelected. On both measures, levels of anti-incumbent sentiment match or exceed those in the last several midterms. In the 2006 and 2010 midterms, which both resulted in a shift in control of the House, about half of voters said they wanted to see most members of Congress defeated. In recent elections, those in the “out” party have been significantly more likely to want to see representatives lose their jobs. But today, perhaps reflecting voters’ more generally negative views about Congress, Republican and Democratic voters are about equally likely to want to see representatives lose their jobs. Seven-in-ten voters who support Republican candidates (70%) and about as many Democratic voters (65%) say they do not want most representatives to win reelection. By contrast, in 2010, about three-quarters (73%) of Republican supporters wanted to see most members of the House ousted, but only 32% of Democratic supporters said the same. And in 2006, on the eve of a Democratic victory that wrested control from the GOP, 65% of Democratic supporters — and just 32% of Republican supporters — wanted to see most representatives defeated. A similar pattern can be found for Republican and Democratic voters’ opinions about their own representative’s reelection. In 2010, Republican voters were much more likely than Democratic voters to want to see their own representative lose reelection; and in 2006, Democratic voters were more likely to say the same. Currently, despite GOP control of the House, Republican voters are as likely as Democratic voters to say they do not want their own representative reelected (33% and 36%, respectively). Just 21% of Americans rate the economy as excellent (2%) or good (19%), with a 45% plurality saying national economic conditions are “only fair.” One-in-three (33%) say the economy is “poor.” These ratings are little changed over the last few months. Democrats are more likely to rate economic conditions positively. Three-in-ten (30%) say the economy is excellent or good, while 69% of say it is only fair or poor. Among Republicans, just 11% rate economic conditions positively. There is some degree of optimism about the economy in the next year: 27% expect conditions to get better, and 50% say they will stay the same, while 21% say the economy will be worse. This sentiment has remained little changed throughout the year. About one-in-three Democrats (34%) expect the economy to improve over the course of the next year, compared with 27% of independents and 18% of Republicans. Roughly half of all partisan groups expect the economic conditions to be the same in a year. Just 13% of Democrats predict that the economy will be worse, as do 25% of Republicans and 23% of independents. When it comes to immigration policy, roughly seven-in-ten (71%) continue to support a way for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status if certain requirements are met. One-in-four (25%) say they should not be allowed to stay. Most of those who say there should be a pathway to legal status support the ability for undocumented immigrants to apply for citizenship: 42% overall say they should be able to apply for citizenship, while 25% of the public thinks they should be able to apply for permanent residency, but not citizenship. Overall support for a legal pathway is little changed from earlier this year. Democrats support allowing undocumented immigrants who meet requirements to stay, by a margin of 82% to 16%. Republicans also favor a pathway to legal status, but by a narrower (57% to 39%) margin, and this is down slightly from February. Majorities of blacks (74%) and whites (67%) continue to say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally if certain requirements are met. And nearly nine-in-ten (88%) Hispanics continue to support a pathway to legal status; about half (51%) say that undocumented immigrants should be able to apply for citizenship while 32% say they should be limited to permanent residency. Views of the Affordable Care Act remain generally unchanged over the past year. More continue to disapprove (51%) than approve (43%) of the law. Republicans remain more unified in their opposition to the law than Democrats are in support of it. Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans (88%) disapprove of the law and just 10% approve of it; among Democrats, 74% approve and 20% disapprove. Liberal Democrats are especially supportive of the ACA (84% approve and 12% disapprove). Moderate and conservative Democrats approve of the law by a somewhat smaller margin (66% to 28%). More college graduates approve of the law (51%) than those with only some college experience (43%) or no college (38%). On the issue of marijuana policy, more continue to say marijuana use should be legal (52%) than illegal (45%), and public views about marijuana are little changed over the last year. Millennial adults — who are now ages 18-33 — remain more supportive of marijuana legalization than those in older generations: 63% of Millennials say marijuana should be legal, while 35% say it should be illegal. The views of Millennials are not significantly different than earlier this year. Baby Boomers (51% legal, 46% illegal) and those in Generation X (54% legal, 44% illegal) are about evenly divided over marijuana legalization, while the majority of those in the Silent Generation are opposed (66% illegal, 27% legal). Democrats continue to support legalization by about two-to-one (64%-34%). But just 31% of Republicans say marijuana should be legal, down 8 points from February.","On the issue of marijuana policy , more continue to say marijuana use should be legal ( 52 % ) than illegal ( 45 % ) , and public views about marijuana are little changed over the last year .","Discuss the public opinion regarding marijuana legalization.","More continue to say marijuana use should be legal ( 52 % ) than illegal ( 45 % ) .","more continue to say marijuana use should be legal ( 52 % ) than illegal ( 45 % ) ."],"6933":["6933.png","Social networking site use by age group, 2005-2011 The percentage of adult internet users in each age group who use social networking sites","Two-thirds of adult internet users (65%) now say they use a social networking site like MySpace, Facebook or LinkedIn, up from 61% one year ago. That’s more than double the percentage that reported social networking site usage in 2008 (29%). And for the first time in Pew Internet surveys it means that half of all adults (50%) use social networking sites. The pace with which new users have flocked to social networking sites has been staggering; when we first asked about social networking sites in February of 2005, just 8% of internet users – or 5% of all adults – said they used them. When we asked SNS users to describe their experiences using the sites, here’s what they said: Looking at usage on a typical day, 43% of online adults use social networking, up from 38% a year ago and just 13% in 2008. Out of all the “daily” online activities that we ask about, only email (which 61% of internet users access on a typical day) and search engines (which 59% use on a typical day) are used more frequently than social networking tools.2 Among internet users, social networking sites are most popular with women and young adults under age 30. Young adult women ages 18-29 are the power users of social networking; fully 89% of those who are online use the sites overall and 69% do so on an average day. As of May 2011, there are no significant differences in use of social networking sites based on race and ethnicity, household income, education level, or whether the internet user lives in an urban, suburban, or rural environment. Looking more closely at gender differences, women have been significantly more likely to use social networking sites than men since 2009. As of May 2011, nearly seven in ten online women are users of social networking sites (69%), compared with six in ten online men (60%). Women are also more active3 in their use of these sites, with almost half of female internet users using social networking sites on a typical day (48%), compared with 38% of male internet users. Social networking sites have been very popular with young adults ages 18-29 almost since their inception. Between February 2005 and August 2006, the use of social networking sites among young adult internet users ages 18-29 jumped from 9% to 49%; during this same time period, use of these sites by 30-49 year olds remained essentially unchanged. Since then, users under age 30 have continued to be significantly more likely to use social networking sites when compared with every other adult age group. As of May 2011, over eight in ten internet users ages 18-29 use social networking sites (83%), compared with seven in ten 30-49 year-olds (70%), half of 50-64 year-olds (51%), and a third of those age 65 and older (33%). However, while young adults have consistently been the most likely to use social networking sites, internet users in other age groups have seen faster rates of growth in recent years. In the past two years, social networking site use among internet users age 65 and older has grown 150%, from 13% in April 2009 to 33% in May 2011. Similarly, during this same time period use by 50-64 year-old internet users doubled—from 25% to 51%. Usage patterns on a typical day reveal a slightly different picture. The frequency of social networking site usage among young adult internet users was stable over the last year – 61% of online Americans in that age cohort now use SNS on a typical day, compared with 60% one year ago. At the same time, those ages 30-49 have become somewhat more likely to use the sites on an average day; the frequency of SNS use among this age group grew a modest 18% (from 39% to 46%) over the past year. However, among the Boomer-aged segment of internet users ages 50-64, SNS usage on a typical day grew a rigorous 60% (from 20% to 32%). And unlike the general growth in SNS adoption among those ages 65 and older, the frequency of use among the oldest group of internet users did not increase significantly over the past year. When social networking users were asked for one word to describe their experiences using social networking sites, “good” was the most common response. Overall, positive responses far outweighed the negative and neutral words that were associated with social networking sites (more than half of the respondents used positive terms). Users repeatedly described their experiences as “fun,” “great,” “interesting” and “convenient.” Less common were superlatives such as “astounding,” “necessity,” and “empowering.” However, negative responses were recorded for roughly one in five respondents who answered this question and these answers included a far more diverse array of adjectives and, at times, expletives. Frustrations were evident among respondents who described their experiences using the networks as “annoying,” “overwhelming,” “boring,” “confusing” and “overrated.” Many respondents offered the words “addictive” or “addicting” as the first thing that came to their mind, while a sizable ambivalent group said their experiences had simply been “okay.” These neutral descriptions were also quite varied, though terms that indicated little experience with the sites—such as “Rarely,” “Seldom” or “Occasionally”—were common in this group. Because the open-ended question asked respondents to “use one single word to describe your experiences using social networking sites,” the adjectives that were shared point to both the user’s interactions on the sites and the functionality of the interface. For instance, one user described her experiences on the sites as “noisy” while another used the word, “glitches.”","Social networking sites have been very popular with young adults ages 18 - 29 almost since their inception .

The share of Democratic voters who describe their political views as liberal has changed little over the past few years after increasing steadily between 2000 and 2016. Liberals outnumber moderates (38%) and conservatives (14%) as a share of Democratic voters. Yet combined, conservatives and moderates continue to make up about half of Democratic voters (51%). While the ideological composition of the Democratic coalition is not much different than in 2016 – when liberals constituted 45% of Democratic voters – liberals make up a larger share of Democratic voters than they did in earlier presidential election years. In 2012, when Barack Obama was reelected, a somewhat larger share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters called themselves moderates (40%) than liberals (37%), while 19% described their views as conservative. And in 2004, when George W. Bush was reelected after defeating John Kerry, just 30% of Democratic voters called themselves liberal, while more than twice as many (66%) described themselves as moderate or conservative. The subset of Democratic voters who describe their views as very liberal has similarly increased since 2000, though they remain a relatively small group within the party. In 2000, just 6% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters said their political views were very liberal. By 2019, 15% of Democrats described their views this way. White Democrats remain more likely than black or Hispanic Democrats to describe themselves as liberal. In 2019, a majority (55%) of white Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters identified themselves as liberal, an increase of 27 percentage points since 2000. Among white Democrats, 19% called themselves very liberal in 2019, compared with 6% in 2000. By contrast, more black Democratic voters continue to characterize their views as moderate rather than liberal. In 2019, 43% of black Democrats called themselves moderate, 29% called themselves liberal and 25% called themselves conservative. Since 2000, the share of black Democrats who describe their political views as liberal has changed little, while liberal identification among white Democrats has nearly doubled. Among Hispanic Democratic voters, 38% described their political views as moderate in 2019, while 37% called themselves liberal and 22% conservative. A majority of Democratic voters with postgraduate experience (62%) described their political views as liberal last year, as did 56% of college graduates with no postgraduate experience. The share calling themselves very liberal was 19% among those with a postgraduate education and 18% among those with a college degree. Fewer Democratic voters among those with some college experience but no degree (43%) and those with no college experience (34%) characterized their political views as liberal or very liberal in 2019. Just 13% of Democrats with some college education and 11% of Democrats with no college education described their own views as very liberal. Americans’ descriptions of their political views are distinct from, but strongly related to, their attitudes on specific issues. Most Americans continue to express at least some mix of liberal and conservative attitudes, but the share with either uniformly liberal or uniformly conservative attitudes has grown in recent years.

These conferences – which are open to all members of the LDS church and are broadcast around the world – offer Mormons an opportunity to hear their leaders speak on a host of topics. As the next conference gets underway this weekend, here are six facts about U.S. Mormons from Pew Research Center surveys: 1The LDS church typically places very high importance on families and traditional gender roles. Indeed, 81% of Mormons say being a good parent is one of the most important things in life. And 73% say the same about having a successful marriage. By comparison, half of all U.S. adults say being a good parent is one of the most important things in life, and only one-third say having a successful marriage is of utmost importance. Additionally, 58% of Mormons say a marriage where the husband provides and the wife stays at home is preferable to one in which both spouses have jobs. Among the general public, most people (62%) express the opposite view, saying a marriage in which both spouses have jobs and take responsibility for housework and child rearing is more satisfying. At this fall’s pre-conference session specifically for Mormon women, participants were urged to defend the church’s teachings on marriage, family and sexuality. 2While nearly all Mormons consider themselves Christian (97%), only about half (51%) of U.S. adults say Mormonism is a Christian religion, according to a 2012 Pew Research Center report. When asked to volunteer the one word that best describes Mormons, the most common response from Mormons surveyed was “Christian” or “Christ-centered” (17%), and an additional 5% volunteered “Jesus.” The most commonly offered response by non-Mormons was “cult.” 3Among all Christian religious traditions in the U.S., Mormons are among the most highly involved in their congregations (67%), according to an analysis based on three measures of congregational involvement: membership in a congregation, frequency of attendance at worship services and frequency of attendance at small group religious activities. Jehovah’s Witnesses have comparable levels of highly involved members (64%), while evangelical Protestants (43%), members of historically black Protestant denominations (41%) and those in other Christian groups have lower average levels of congregational involvement. In addition, our Religious Landscape Study found that Mormons are among the groups most likely to believe the Bible is the word of God (91%), pray daily (85%), say religion is very important in their lives (84%) and read scripture regularly (77%). 4A number of tenets central to the teachings of the LDS church and widely held by Mormons are not shared by other Christian traditions, our 2011 survey found. Nine-in-ten Mormons believe that the president of the LDS church is a prophet of God (94%) and that the Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets (91%). Large majorities of Mormons believe that families can be bound together eternally in temple ceremonies (95%) and that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate, physical beings (94%). 5Mormons are among the most politically and socially conservative religious groups in the U.S. For example, two-thirds of Mormons say they oppose allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, and seven-in-ten say they think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, according to the 2014 U.S. Religious Landscape Study. And most Mormons (69% in 2016) identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, though the share who do so has edged downward in recent years. 6Mormons are relatively young and less diverse when compared with other Christian groups, and they are younger than the U.S. population as a whole. The median age of U.S. Mormons is 43, while the median age of the general population is 46. As a religious group, they also are much less racially and ethnically diverse than the U.S. population as a whole, with fully 85% of U.S. Mormons identifying as non-Hispanic white.","Among all Christian religious traditions in the U.S. , Mormons are among the most highly involved in their congregations ( 67 % ) , according to an analysis based on three measures of congregational involvement : membership in a congregation , frequency of attendance at worship services and frequency of attendance at small group religious activities .

According to Pew Research Center projections, a record 27.3 million Latinos are eligible to cast ballots, representing 12% of all eligible voters. Since 2012, the number of Hispanic eligible voters has increased by 4 million, accounting for 37% of the growth in all eligible voters during that span. The Hispanic share of eligible voters in several key battleground states has also gone up. Latinos have favored the Democratic Party over the Republican Party in every presidential election since at least the 1980s, but their electoral impact has long been limited by low voter turnout and a population concentrated in non-battleground states. Despite large growth in the number of eligible Latino voters, it remains to be seen whether their turnout will set a record in November. Here are key facts about the Latino vote in 2016. 1Millennials make up 44% of Latino eligible voters and are the main driver of growth in the Latino electorate. From 2012 to 2016, 3.2 million young U.S.-born Latinos came of age and turned 18, accounting for 80% of the increase in Latino eligible voters during this time. 2Among Latino registered voters who are “absolutely certain” they will vote, one-in-five will be voting for the first time, according to Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos, published this month. Among Millennial voters, 36% say they will be casting a ballot for the first time, compared with 9% of non-Millennial voters ages 36 and older. 3There are only a handful of competitive states in this year’s presidential election where Latinos account for a significant share of the vote. Out of seven competitive states, Latinos have a significant presence in three: Arizona (22%), Florida (18%) and Nevada (17%). Latinos make up 5% or less of eligible voters in each of the remaining four: Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio. At the same time, the impact of the Latino vote on the presidential race is lessened by the fact that more than half (52%) of all Latino eligible voters live in the non-battleground states of California, Texas and New York. 4Hispanic registered voters have grown more dissatisfied with the nation’s direction. In 2016, 57% of Hispanic voters say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, up from 50% in 2012. Among them, those born in the U.S. are more dissatisfied than immigrants, 63% to 45%. 5A slightly lower share of Latino registered voters say they are sure they will vote this year compared with four years ago. This year, 69% of Latinos are “absolutely certain” they will vote in November, down from 77% in 2012. In past elections, the Latino voter turnout rate has lagged that of other groups. For example, in 2012 Latinos had a turnout rate of 48%, compared with 67% for blacks and 64% for whites. 6Latinos have long viewed the Democratic Party as having more concern for Latinos than the Republican Party, but their views of Democrats have fluctuated. In 2016, 54% of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party has more concern for Latinos than the Republican Party, while 11% say the same of the GOP. Democrats have maintained this advantage since 2012, though the share of Latinos who say Democrats have more concern for Latinos has declined modestly since then, when 61% said this. About one-in-four Latino voters say there is no difference between the parties on this measure. 7Hillary Clinton has more enthusiastic support from older Latinos than from Millennial Latinos. Two-thirds (64%) of Millennial Latinos (ages 18 to 35) who back Clinton say their support is more a vote against Donald Trump than for Clinton. The reverse is true among older, non-Millennial Latino voters (ages 36 and older): 65% say their support of Clinton is more a vote for her than against Trump. Overall, more than half (55%) of Latino registered voters who back Clinton say their vote is more a vote for Clinton than against Trump. 8Three-quarters of Hispanic registered voters say they have discussed Trump’s comments about Hispanics or other groups with family, friends or coworkers. Those who have discussed Trump’s controversial comments on Hispanics, Mexican immigrants and other groups in the past year have given more thought to the election and are more certain they will vote.","Millennials make up 44 % of Latino eligible voters and are the main driver of growth in the Latino electorate .

Both parties’ favorability ratings are more negative than positive and fewer than half say either party has high ethical standards. Majorities also fault both for their approach to government spending. But as in the past, more say the Democratic Party “cares about the middle class” (57%) than say that about the Republican Party (42%). And while 54% say the Republican Party is “too extreme,” fewer (45%) say this phrase applies to the Democratic Party. The share saying the Democratic Party is too extreme has risen over the past year (from 37%) while perceptions of the GOP have shown less change. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted June 8-18 among 2,504 adults, finds that despite the tumult in Washington, overall impressions of the two parties – and President Trump – have changed very little since April. Currently, 39% approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 55% disapprove. For more, see detailed demographic tables on Trump’s job approval. Just 40% view the Republican Party favorably, while 54% have an unfavorable impression. Opinions about the Democratic Party are similar (44% favorable, 50% unfavorable). As Congress continues to debate the budget and government spending, majorities are critical of the way that both parties handle these issues. Nearly two-thirds (64%) say the Republican Party is “too willing to cut government programs even when they work.” About as many (61%) say the Democratic Party “too often sees government as the only way to solve problems.” In general, Republicans and Democrats ascribe positive traits to their own party, while holding negative views of the opposing party. For example, about two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (66%) say their party has high ethical standards, while about the same share of Republicans and Republican leaners (64%) say the same about the GOP. Comparable shares in each party (24% of Democrats, 21% of Republicans) say the opposing party has high ethical standards. While large majorities in both parties characterize the other party as too extreme, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to describe their party this way (24% of Republicans, 18% of Democrats). Republicans also are far more likely to say the Democratic Party cares about the middle class than vice versa: 31% of Republicans say the Democratic Party cares about the middle class, compared with 16% of Democrats who say this about the GOP. Many Democrats – especially conservative and moderate Democrats – fault their party for too often viewing government as the only way to solve problems. Overall, 44% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say their party too often sees government as the solution; conservative and moderate Democrats (50%) are more likely than liberal Democrats (38%) to say this. Roughly a third of Republicans and Republican leaners (35%) say the Republican Party is too willing to cut government programs even when they work. The critique that the GOP cuts programs even when effective is more widespread among moderate and liberal Republicans (51%) than among conservative Republicans (28%). Perceptions of both parties remain little changed from April. Currently, four-in-ten have a favorable view of the Republican Party, while 54% express an unfavorable one. A comparable share of the public rates the Democratic Party favorably (44%), while half have an unfavorable opinion. Ratings for both parties are lower than they were in January, when about half viewed the Democratic (51%) and Republican (47%) parties favorably. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and leaners (77%) have a favorable view of the GOP, little changed since the beginning of the year. Democrats view the GOP less favorably now (12%) than in January (23%). Fully three-quarters of Democrats (75%) rate their party positively today, up slightly from April (70%). Republicans view the Democratic Party less favorably today (11%) than they did in January (23%). Donald Trump’s job approval continues to remain more negative than positive. Currently, 39% of the public approves of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 55% disapprove. Ratings of Trump are virtually unchanged from April (39% approved) and February (also 39%). As has been the case throughout the early stages of Trump’s presidency, these views are starkly divided by gender, race and ethnicity, age and education. Support for Trump is highest among whites, men and older adults. Half of whites approve of the job Trump is doing as president, and 44% disapprove – the only major demographic group in which more approve than disapprove. Large majorities of blacks (88%) and Hispanics (72%) give Trump negative job ratings. Among men, nearly half (49%) disapprove of Trump’s job performance, while 44% approve. Women disapprove by a much wider margin (60% to 34%). Adults 50 and older are divided in their views of Trump: 46% approve, 49% disapprove. Among those under 50, 32% approve, while nearly twice as many (60%) disapprove. There continues to be an educational divide in views of Trump. Two-thirds of Americans with a college degree or more education (66%) – including three-quarters of those with a postgraduate degree – disapprove of Trump as president. Trump’s job rating is more divided among those with less education. Among adults without a four-year degree, 42% approve of the job Trump is doing and 50% disapprove.","The public continues to be critical of both political parties .

Among those who only own one device, the % who said lthey owned each of the following 100% ","The release of Chromecast by Google last month is only the latest effort by tech companies to make sure all those smartphones, laptops, and tablets you’ve bought are properly connected and streaming. Some experts envision device owners living in a programmable world in which everything from the coffee pot in your house to the temperature in your office are all personalized and integrated. But there is one segment of the population who would see no benefit in services like these – people who own only one device. In April 2012, the Pew Research Center measured ownership of five different types of computing devices—cell phones, desktop computers, laptop computers, e-readers, and tablet computers—and found that one in ten Americans (13%) only owned a cell phone and none of the other four devices. Seniors, non-whites, those with less than a college education, and those living in households with an annual income of less than $50,000 a year were especially likely to say that they owned only one of these five devices, and that the device they owned was a cell phone. Cell phones were the most popular device in April 2012, followed by laptops, desktop computers, tablets, and e-readers. At that time: The typical (median) American owned two of the above devices and 17% said they only owned one of these devices. Some 77% of single-device owners said their one device was a cell phone. Another 17% of those with one device said it was a desktop, while 6% said it was a laptop. Fewer than 1% of these one-device owners said their only device was an e-reader, and none said that their one device was a tablet computer. As tablet computers and e-readers have grown in popularity, the proportion of Americans who own four or more computing devices has increased. In May 2010, just 4% of Americans owned four or five of the devices we measured; by April 2012, that figure had risen to 20% of all Americans. This accumulation of devices is mainly being driven by the educated and affluent. Looking at 2012 data, almost one quarter (23%) of college graduates own four devices, and 9% own five devices. By contrast, among those without a high school diploma just 4% own four devices and 4% own five devices. Similarly, 28% of those living in households with an annual income of $75,000 or more own four devices and 12% own five devices. This contrasts with the 4% of those living in households with an annual income of less than $30,000 who own four devices and 2% who own five devices.","The typical ( median ) American owned two of the above devices and 17 % said they only owned one of these devices .

A third of the public (33%) says they most closely followed news about the oil leak now threatening the coasts of several southeastern states. Fewer say they followed news about the Times Square investigation (13%) or the new Arizona immigration law (16%) more closely than any other story, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted May 7-10 among 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. In terms of coverage, the media devoted 25% of the newshole to the Times Square investigation and 20% to the Gulf Coast oil leak, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). When it comes to the economy, the public sees little change in the tenor of recent news. Two-thirds (66%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, matching the numbers from early April and early March. Americans give generally high marks to the press for its handling of the ongoing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico (66% rate coverage as excellent or good) and the investigation into the Times Square bomb attempt (63% excellent or good). Opinions are more measured about press performance covering the new Arizona law that gives police more authority to question people they suspect might be illegal immigrants (48% excellent or good). Public views about the mix of economic news have changed little since the start of 2010. Currently, 66% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, about the same as the 65% recorded Jan. 8-11. About three-in-ten (29%) say they are hearing mostly bad news, while 4% say they are hearing mostly good news. Those numbers also are little changed this year. Among partisans, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they are hearing mostly bad news (35% vs. 21%). Independents fall in the middle (28% mostly bad). Close to seven-in-ten Democrats (72%) and independents (68%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad economic news, compared with 61% of Republicans. Few in any group report hearing mostly good news (7% of Democrats, 4% of independents and 2% of Republicans). Perceptions of news about the job situation show a slight improvement over last month and a larger improvement since the start of the year. Close to four-in-ten (38%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about jobs, compared with 33% in April and 31% in January. That is the highest percentage saying this since the question was first asked in June 2009 (27%). Just more than half (52%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation, not statistically different from 56% last month but down from 61% in January. That number stood at 71% last June. On the other hand, perceptions of news about the financial markets have become more negative following last week’s dramatic drop in stock prices worldwide. Most of the survey was completed before the markets surged upwards on Monday. About four-in-ten (41%) say they have been hearing mostly bad news about the markets, up 11 points from 30% one month earlier. In early April, 15% said they were hearing mostly good news about the financial markets. Now, 6% say that. The percent that says they have been hearing a mix of good and bad is essentially unchanged (49%). The public perceives no real change in news about real estate values or prices for food and consumer goods. Currently, 42% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about real estate values, 41% say they are hearing mostly bad news and 12% say they are hearing mostly good news. Fully 46% say they are hearing a mix of news about prices for food and consumer goods, 37% say they are hearing mostly bad news and 8% say they are hearing mostly good news about this. As coverage of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico changed from a story about a deadly oil rig explosion to one about a potentially catastrophic threat to the Gulf Coast, public interest grew and has stayed high. Shortly after the April 20 explosion, 21% said they were they were following the story very closely. One week later, as the oil slick spread, 44% said they were following the story very closely. Interest had doubled across most demographic and political groups. Now, 46% say they followed the story very closely last week as the slick approached land and oil continued to flow from the underwater well. A third (33%) say this was the story they followed most closely, much more than any other news story in the survey. Coverage of the story ramped up as well. The week the story broke (April 19-25), it accounted for 5% of the newshole measured by PEJ. The following week that had grown to 16%. Last week it accounted for 20% of coverage. The public also continued to track news about the new Arizona law that gives police greater authority to question people they suspect might be illegal immigrants. Close to four-in-ten (38%) say they followed this story very closely; 16% say this was the story they followed most closely. Coverage, on the other hand, fell off significantly. News about the immigration law made up 2% of coverage, down from 16% one week earlier. Interest in the investigation and arrests following the attempted car bombing in Times Square was similar: 37% say they followed this story very closely, while 13% say this was the story they followed most closely. News about the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, reports about potential links to the Taliban in Pakistan and the implications on U.S. anti-terror policies accounted for 25% of the newshole, higher than any other story last week. The public also continued to keep a watch on economic news, with 42% saying they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely. Just over one-in-ten (11%) say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the economy – separating out news about the Greek financial crisis – accounted for 8% of coverage. About three-in-ten (29%) say they very closely followed news about flooding in Nashville, Tenn., and other parts of the Southeast; 11% say this was the story they followed most closely. News about the flooding accounted for 4% of coverage, according to PEJ. About two-in-ten (19%) say they very closely followed news about the financial crisis in Greece and violent protests there. Just 4% say this was the story they followed most closely, while news about the crisis made up 4% of coverage. The public gives generally good marks to the press for its coverage of both the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico and the investigation into the attempted car bombing in Times Square. Perceptions of coverage of the contentious fight over Arizona’s new immigration law are not as positive. In all three cases, those who say they were following the stories very closely are more likely to rate the coverage positively than those following l ess closely. About a quarter of the public rate coverage of the oil leak as excellent (23%), while another 43% rate it as good. About two-in-ten (18%) rate it as only fair; 12% say it has been poor. Among those following very closely, 32% rate coverage as excellent. That drops to 16% among those following less closely. A similar pattern is evident in ratings of coverage of the Times Square bomb attempt. About two-in-ten (21%) say coverage has been excellent, 42% say good, 21% say only fair and 10% say poor. Among those following very closely, 34% rate the coverage as excellent; fewer (13%) among those following less closely rate the coverage that highly. Fewer rate coverage of the debate over the Arizona immigration law as excellent (13%), while 41% say it has been good. A quarter (25%) rate press coverage as only fair and 19% rate it as poor. Among those following very closely, 20% rate the coverage as excellent, compared with 8% of those following less closely. Most Americans say they heard at least a little about a recall of many children’s medicines, including Tylenol and Motrin (29% a lot, 40% a little). About as many say they heard at least a little about plans for a merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines (19% a lot, 47% a little). Fewer than half say they heard that much about elections in Great Britain that ousted the Labor Party after 13 years of controlling Parliament (12% a lot, 35% a little); 54% say they heard nothing at all about this. Fewer still had heard at least a little about a parody video made by soldiers in Afghanistan that had gotten media attention as it spread on the internet. Just 7% say they heard a lot about the video of soldiers dancing to the Lady Gaga song “Telephone;” 27% say they heard a little about this. Two-thirds (66%) heard nothing at all. There are few differences by demographics or partisanship when it comes to familiarity with these news stories. Women are more likely than men to have heard a lot about the recall of children’s medicines. Still, just 34% of women and 24% of men heard a lot about this. College graduates are more likely than those without a college degree to say they heard a lot about the British elections (24% versus 6%). These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected May 3-9, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected May 7-10, from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, under the direction of Infogroup/ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). The sample is produced by ORC from data provided by Marketing Systems Group. Interviews are conducted in English. Data are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, region and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population survey. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the current survey, conducted May 7-10, 2010: In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","Interest in the investigation and arrests following the attempted car bombing in Times Square was similar : 37 % say they followed this story very closely , while 13 % say this was the story they followed most closely .

Overall, 58% of U.S. adults feel the news media do not understand people like them, while 40% feel they are understood, as reported in a recent Pew Research Center study. Republicans, however, are nearly three times as likely to feel that news organizations don’t understand them (73%) as they are to say they feel understood (25%). By comparison, most Democrats (58%) say they feel understood by the news media, while four-in-ten say they do not. Not only are Republicans far more likely to feel misunderstood by the news media, they feel this way regardless of their media habits and demographic characteristics, according to the analysis of data collected Feb. 22 to March 4, 2018, among 5,035 U.S. adults. About three-quarters of Republicans who are very interested in the news (74%) say news organizations do not understand people like them – about the same share as among those who are somewhat interested (70%) and not interested in the news (78%). Among Democrats, however, news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood. About a quarter of Democrats who are very interested in the news feel misunderstood (27%), compared with about four-in-ten of the somewhat interested (39%) and roughly half of those not interested (52%). Still, Democrats at all levels of news interest are much less likely than Republicans to feel misunderstood by the news media. (For more on the measure of news interest, see this report.) Republicans differ little across various demographic groups in saying people like them are misunderstood by the media. For example, Republicans have high levels of feeling misunderstood across sex, age and education groups (between 70% and 76% in each group say they feel misunderstood). Among Democrats, however, there are differences across demographic traits, especially when it comes to education and age. About three-in-ten Democrats with at least a college degree (29%) feel misunderstood by the news media, compared with 42% of those with some college education and 47% of those with a high school diploma or less. Democrats ages 50 and older are also less likely to feel misunderstood than those under age 50 (35% vs. 44%). Overall, independents fall somewhere between Republicans and Democrats in feeling misunderstood by the news media (63% say this), though whether they lean to the Republican or Democratic Party has a strong influence. Independents who lean to the Republican Party are far more likely to feel misunderstood than those who lean Democratic (80% vs. 51%, respectively, say they feel misunderstood by the news media). The deep divides between Republicans and Democrats in feeling misunderstood by news organizations is largely in line with partisan divides in trust in national media and perceived fairness in news coverage. As seen in previous findings, Republicans are far less likely than Democrats to say they have a lot of trust in the information they get from national news organizations and are more likely to think the news media tend to favor one side. Note: For more information, see the methodology.","Among Democrats , however , news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood .

Francis’ trip later this month includes a meeting with President Obama and an address to a joint session of Congress in Washington before he goes on to New York (and the United Nations) and, finally, to Philadelphia for the 2015 World Meeting of Families. The trip is part of a busy fall for the pope. The Catholic Church also will convene a synod on family issues at the Vatican in October; the synod will examine the role in the church of divorced and remarried Catholics as well as gays and lesbians. Ahead of these events, the Pew Research Center asked American Catholics for their views about family structures, religious beliefs and practices and other topics. Here are several key findings from the new survey: 1Most American Catholics are comfortable with family arrangements that have been traditionally frowned upon by the church. For example, most U.S. Catholics say it is at least “acceptable” – and many say it is just “as good as” any other arrangement – for children to be raised by unmarried parents, gay or lesbian parents, single parents or divorced parents. Majorities also are accepting of a husband and wife who choose not to have children, a man and woman living together romantically without being married, and a same-sex couple living together. 2The survey finds that the share of Americans with some connection to Catholicism approaches half of the country’s adults – 45%. This includes 20% who identify their religion as Catholic. Another 9% are categorized by the survey as “cultural Catholics” – those whose primary religious identity is not Catholic (most are Protestants or religious “nones”), but who say they consider themselves Catholic or partially Catholic in some way. An additional 9% are ex-Catholics – those who were raised Catholic but now eschew any Catholic identity. And 8% have other connections to Catholicism, such as having a Catholic spouse. 3Among all U.S. adults who were raised Catholic, half (52%) have left the church at some point in their life. This includes some whose departure was only temporary: 11% of all people raised Catholic left the church but later returned. But about four-in-ten of those raised Catholic now do not identify as Catholic by religion, including 28% who do not identify as Catholic in any way (“ex-Catholics”). 4Even among those who identify as Catholic, many disagree with church teaching about what constitutes a sin in some family-related areas. Roughly half or more of U.S. Catholics say that using contraceptives, living with a romantic partner outside of marriage and remarrying after a divorce without an annulment are not sins. And about four-in-ten (39%) say homosexual behavior is not a sin. 5Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly are more likely than other Catholics to have opinions that align with church policies and teachings. But even among frequent churchgoers, majorities are open to non-traditional family arrangements. For example, roughly a third of Catholics who attend Mass weekly (34%) say children being raised by a same-sex couple is acceptable and as good as any other arrangement, which is similar to the share who see this as unacceptable (36%). 6On another topic Pope Francis has brought to the fore – poverty and its relationship with climate change – most U.S. Catholics (62%) say working to help the poor and needy is essential to what being Catholic means to them. But fewer (41%) say it is a sin to buy luxury goods without contributing to the poor. And fewer still express concerns about environmental issues in a religious context: 29% say working to address climate change (as urged by Pope Francis in an encyclical released shortly after the survey was conducted) is an essential part of their Catholic identity, and 23% say it is a sin to use energy without considering the environment.","Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly are more likely than other Catholics to have opinions that align with church policies and teachings .

And which factors may help – or hurt – the former secretary of state in a second run for the White House? A poll last week by the Pew Research Center found that 59% of Democratic voters said there was a “good chance” they would vote for Clinton. That is higher than the 52% of Democrats who said there was a good chance they would back Clinton at a comparable point in 2007. The bigger change, by far, is the state of Clinton’s possible Democratic competition. In early 2007, a first-term senator named Barack Obama was already running for president – and 32% of Democrats saw a good chance of supporting him. By June of that year, Clinton’s advantage on the “good chance” measure had narrowed to 10 points over Obama and former Vice President Al Gore (44%, versus 34% for each). Today, no more than about one-in-five Democratic voters see a good chance of voting for any other Democrat: 22% say there is a good chance they would vote for Vice President Joe Biden, and about the same proportion (21%) say this about Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – and neither has shown serious signs of running. Support for Clinton dwarfs that for the three lesser-known figures in the Democratic field who have suggested they are running: Just 8% say there is a good chance they would vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic-leaning independent, with even fewer supporting former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia (2% good chance) or former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (1% good chance). As was the case in 2007, there are demographic differences in Clinton’s support among Democrats. In particular, although 54% of white Democratic voters say there’s a good chance they’d vote for Clinton, that number rises to 66% of non-white Democratic voters – including 74% of African-Americans. In February 2007, 62% of African-American Democratic voters said there was a good chance they would vote for Clinton; 34% said the same about Obama, who was less well-known. Looking at the broader electorate, Clinton also has more strong support than any potential GOP contender in the 2016 general election. A third of voters (33%) say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton (52% say there is at least some chance). Just 12% say there is a good chance they would vote for any of the possible Republican candidates. Clinton has been in the public spotlight for more than two decades. Her personal favorability ratings have fluctuated a great deal over this period – from her tenure as first lady, through her election as a U.S. senator, and finally during her years as secretary of state. She also brings a unique set of traits and experiences to the presidential campaign. Here are some early measures of how these might affect her candidacy: Gender. Even before Clinton’s announcement, there was a gender gap – among Democrats – in views of Clinton. Fully 61% of white Democratic women say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton, compared with 43% of white Democratic men. To be sure, white Democratic men haven’t ruled out voting for Clinton – only about one-in-ten white Democrats, men and women, say there is no chance they would vote for her. But at this stage, more white Democratic women strongly support her. The possible history-making aspect of Clinton’s candidacy also registers more strongly with Democratic women than with men. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, 69% of Democratic women, but just 46% of Democratic men, said they hope the U.S. elects a female president in their lifetime. Republican women and men – perhaps already contemplating a possible Clinton campaign – were far less likely than Democrats to say they were hoping for a woman president. Most Republican men (80%) and women (76%) said it did not matter to them if a female president is elected in their lifetime. The ‘Clinton factor.’ At this early stage in the campaign, few people seem bothered by the Clinton family’s long involvement in Democratic politics, or by Hillary Clinton’s role in her husband’s administration. Asked in the current survey about the large role the Clinton family continues to play in the Democratic Party, just 11% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters say they are bothered by this, while 88% say it does not really bother them. This is similar to views in a March 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today, when 51% of Democrats and Democratic leaners said that Hillary Clinton’s involvement in the Bill Clinton administration would help her if she decided to run for president; just 11% said it would hurt her and 37% said it would not make a difference. Clinton’s experience. In the same poll, now more than a year old, most people (67%) approved of Clinton’s job performance as secretary of state. (This was before the controversy over Clinton’s private email account.) When people were asked in an open-ended format about the most positive and negative aspects of Clinton’s career, 12% volunteered her experience as secretary of state as the one thing they viewed most positively. Yet 15% cited “Benghazi” – Clinton’s handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya – as the most negative aspect of her background. In general, extensive Washington experience appears to be a less attractive attribute for a presidential candidate than it once was. At about this point in the 2008 campaign, 35% said they would be more likely to support a candidate who has been an elected official in Washington for many years, while 15% would be less likely; 45% said extensive Washington experience wouldn’t matter. But by last year, those views had changed. More Americans viewed lengthy Washington experience as a negative (30%) than a positive (19%) for a presidential candidate; 48% said it wouldn’t matter. Among Democrats, Republicans and independents, the share saying they would be more likely to support a candidate with many years of Washington experience declined between 2007 and 2014.","A poll last week by the Pew Research Center found that 59 % of Democratic voters said there was a “ good chance ” they would vote for Clinton . That is higher than the 52 % of Democrats who said there was a good chance they would back Clinton at a comparable point in 2007 . The bigger change , by far , is the state of Clinton ’s possible Democratic competition . In early 2007 , a first - term senator named Barack Obama was already running for president – and 32 % of Democrats saw a good chance of supporting him . By June of that year , Clinton ’s advantage on the “ good chance ” measure had narrowed to 10 points over Obama and former Vice President Al Gore ( 44 % , versus 34 % for each ) .","What was support for Clinton compared to 2007?","That is higher than the 52 % of Democrats who said there was a good chance they would back Clinton at a comparable point in 2007","That is higher than the 52 % of Democrats who said there was a good chance they would back Clinton at a comparable point in 2007"],"7374":["7374.png","Same Sex Marriage Gains More Acceptance Marriage","Polls this year have found that more Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally than did so just last year. In two polls conducted over the past few months, based on interviews with more than 6,000 adults, 42% favor same-sex marriage while 48% are opposed. In polls conducted in 2009, 37% favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally and 54% were opposed. For the first time in 15 years of Pew Research Center polling, fewer than half oppose same-sex marriage. The shift in opinion on same-sex marriage has been broad-based, occurring across many demographic, political and religious groups. Notably, pluralities of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally – the first time this has occurred in Pew Research Center surveys. Political independents are divided in their views of same-sex-marriage; in 2009, they opposed it by a wide margin. The surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life have found that same-sex marriage ranks at the bottom of the list of issues in this year’s congressional elections. Not surprisingly, far more voters are saying the economy and jobs will be very important to their vote this year. The public continues to be far more supportive of gays and lesbians serving openly in the military than of allowing legal same-sex marriages. This year, 60% say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while 30% oppose this. Support for gays serving openly in the military has remained fairly stable over the last five years. In 1994, shortly after the Clinton administration implemented the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, opinion was more evenly divided (52% favor vs. 45% oppose). There are substantial age and generational differences in opinions about same-sex marriage. Millennials, born after 1980, favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally by a 53% to 39% margin. Support for gay marriage among Millennials has changed little in recent years, but is up from 2004 when opinion was more divided. Among Gen Xers (born 1965 to 1980), 48% now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 43% are opposed. Support is up from 2009 when 41% favored this and 50% were opposed, but is on par with levels in 2001. There is less support for same-sex marriage among Baby Boomers – those born 1946 to 1964 – than among younger age groups. Currently, 38% favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 52% are opposed. Still, support among Baby Boomers has increased over the past year (from 32%). The Silent Generation (born 1928 to 1945) continues to oppose same-sex marriage; just 29% favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 59% are opposed. Even among the Silent Generation, however, there is somewhat more support than in 2009 (23% favor) and substantially greater support than in 2003, when just 17% backed gay marriage. There also are substantial partisan differences on the issue of same-sex marriage. A majority of Democrats (53%) favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 38% are opposed. By contrast, only 24% of Republicans support same-sex marriage and 69% are opposed. Independents and other non-partisans are now divided in their view: 44% favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 43% are opposed. In 2009, more independents opposed same-sex marriage than favored it (37% favor, 51% oppose). Throughout the past decade, opinion among independents has tracked more closely with Democrats than Republicans on this issue. Among Democrats and Republicans there is a substantial ideological divide. Liberal Democrats favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally by more than a three-to-one margin (75% favor, 20% oppose). And conservative Republicans oppose same-sex marriage by an equally wide margin (16% favor, 77% oppose). But moderate Republicans and Democrats are more divided in their views. While 41% of moderate and liberal Republicans support same-sex marriage, 51% are opposed. Similarly, 41% of conservative and moderate Democrats favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally and 48% are opposed. Whites are now evenly divided over gay marriage; in polls conducted this year, 44% of non-Hispanic whites favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally and 46% are opposed. In three surveys between August 2008 and August 2009, 39% of non-Hispanic whites favored same-sex marriage compared with 52% who were opposed. By contrast, blacks continue to oppose same-sex marriage by a wide margin. In 2010, just 30% of non-Hispanic blacks favor gay marriage while 59% are opposed. From 2008 to 2009, 28% of blacks favored same-sex marriage and 62% were opposed (surveys were combined to increase sample size). Notably, the gender, age and education differences among the general public are mirrored among whites and blacks; however, there is far less support among all subgroups of blacks. Overall, women continue to be more supportive of same-sex marriage than are men. Opinion among women is evenly divided: 46% favor same-sex marriage and 45% are opposed. Roughly four-in-ten (38%) men support allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 51% are opposed. A majority (52%) of college graduates favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Support is much lower among those without a college degree – 46% with some college education and 34% with a high school education or less support same-sex marriage. But among these two education groups, more now favor same-sex marriage than did so over the past two years. Americans living in the Midwest are now evenly split over same-sex marriage; 44% favor and 44% oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Opinion has shifted substantially since 2008 and 2009 when only 36% in the Midwest favored this and 54% were opposed. Support also is up in the South but a majority (55%) continues to oppose allowing same-sex marriage. As was the case over the past two years, more in the Northeast favor than oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally (49% vs. 41%). Those living in the West are about evenly divided in their opinion (47% favor, 45% oppose). For details on these comparisons and others, as well as data for 1996, see tables on pgs. 14-17. White mainline Protestants and white Catholics have become more supportive of gay marriage, though virtually all of the change in opinion among both groups has come among those who attend services relatively infrequently. About half (49%) of white mainline Protestants support same-sex marriage while 38% oppose this. This is a reversal of opinion from the past two years when 40% favored and 49% opposed allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Just 35% of white mainline Protestants who attend church at least once a week favor same-sex marriage, nearly the same percentage as in 2008-2009 (34%). Among those who attend services less often, support has increased by 11 points (from 42% to 53%). There has been a similar shift among white Catholics – 49% now favor same-sex marriage while 41% are opposed. Opinion was more evenly divided over the past two years (44% fa vor, 45% oppose). Here too, support has increased among those who attend services less than weekly, from 51% in 2008-2009 to 59% in 2010. White evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly oppose gay marriage (20% favor vs. 74% oppose), and these opinions have changed little since 2008-2009. Similarly, black Protestants continue to oppose gay marriage by a wide margin (28% favor vs. 62% oppose). By contrast, Jews and the unaffiliated have remained far more supportive of same-sex marriage. Their views also have changed little during this time. Three-quarters of Jews (76%) and 62% of the religiously unaffiliated say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. The economy and jobs overshadow other issues, including social issues such as abortion and gay marriage, in importance for voters. Fully 90% of registered voters say the economy will be very important to their vote while nearly as many (88%) rate jobs as very important. By contrast, just 43% say abortion will be very important and just 32% say the same about same-sex marriage – the lowest percentage for 13 issues tested. Opponents of same-sex marriage (44% very important) are more likely than supporters (22%) to say that this issue will be very important to their vote. White evangelical Protestant voters are far more likely than any other religious group to say that same-sex marriage is very important to their vote in this year’s midterm election – 46% say this compared with less than a third in all other religious groups. For more on the importance of various issues in the 2010 elections and the impact of religion on various issues, see Few Say Religion Shapes Immigration, Environment Views: Religion and the Issues. By a two-to-one margin (60% favor, 30% oppose), Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. While views on this issue have changed little in recent years, there was less support for gays serving openly in 1994 (52% favor vs. 45% oppose). Across most demographic groups, majorities favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military – and in most groups there is more support than in 1994. Nonetheless, as with views about same-sex marriage, there are differences of opinion across political and demographic groups. Democrats, women, whites, younger people and college graduates are more likely to support gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. Opinion is more divided among key groups who also oppose same-sex marriage – 47% of Republicans favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military while 43% are opposed. By comparison, 67% of Democrats and 63% of independents favor this. While 43% of white evangelical Protestants support allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, 47% are opposed. Black Protestants are similarly divided (46% favor, 41% oppose). Support is greater among other religious groups – 68% of white mainline Protestants, 68% of Catholics and 66% of the religiously unaffiliated favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. And far fewer people who attend religious services weekly or more support gays serving openly in the military compared with those who attend less often.

About two-thirds of the public (64%) give officers a warm rating on the scale (between 51 and 100), including 45% who rate them very warmly (76-100). Fewer give a neutral rating of 50 (16%), and just 18% give a cold rating on the scale (0-49). But while a clear majority of whites give law enforcement warm ratings (74%), black and Hispanic views of police are more mixed. Just three-in-ten black Americans (30%) express warm attitudes about police officers, while 28% offer a neutral rating. Another 38% give a cold rating, including 30% who give a very cold rating (24 or lower on the 0-100 scale). Among Hispanics, 55% give police officers a warm rating, 25% give law enforcement a neutral rating and 17% have cold views. These racial and ethnic differences in views of police officers are consistent with previous Pew Research Center findings that blacks are less likely than whites to express confidence in the police in their communities. Views of police officers also differ substantially across age groups. About half (48%) of adults younger than 30 give a warm rating to law enforcement, 22% are neutral and another 29% are cold in their assessments. By comparison, 80% of adults ages 65 and older rate police officers warmly, including 61% who have very warm views. Notably, while greater racial and ethnic diversity among younger adults accounts for some of the age differences in these views, there are significant age differences within racial and ethnic groups. For instance, 28% of whites younger than 30 give cold ratings to officers, compared with just 6% of whites 65 and older. And while just 27% of blacks ages 50 and older offer a cold rating for police officers, that rises to 46% among blacks younger than 50. Police officers are also viewed more positively by Republicans than Democrats. Among Republicans, 86% give officers a warm rating, including 74% who rate officers very warmly. Among Democrats, 57% give officers a warm rating on the scale (including just 33% who rate officers very warmly), while 21% offer a neutral rating and 19% offer a cold rating. Conservative and moderate Democrats (58%) and liberal Democrats (56%) are about equally likely to rate officers warmly, but liberal Democrats are less likely to offer a very warm rating. As in the public overall, older Democrats express warmer views of police officers than younger Democrats do. While 70% of Democrats ages 65 and older have a warm view, that compares with fewer than half (46%) of those younger than 30. Three-in-ten Democrats ages 18 to 29 give officers a cold rating. There is also a substantial racial and ethnic divide in views of police officers among Democrats. While just 32% of black Democrats offer a warm rating of officers, that rises to 52% among Hispanic Democrats and 71% among white Democrats. Although white Democrats have more positive views of the police than black and Hispanic Democrats, a substantial partisan divide remains among whites: 71% of white Democrats have a warm view of police officers, compared with 87% of white Republicans. This gap is even more pronounced in the shares who rate officers very warmly (41% vs. 76%).","About two - thirds of the public ( 64 % ) give officers a warm rating on the scale ( between 51 and 100 ) , including 45 % who rate them very warmly ( 76 - 100 ) .

This group—which comprises 69% of all American adults and 88% of all internet users—includes anyone who has turned to online sources for one or more of the following reasons: In that same report, we found that online economic users relied heavily on online sources to make sense of the economic crisis, to adjust their own personal finances, and to share their experiences during the recession with others. This data memo, based on a national telephone survey conducted March 26 to April 19, 2009 among 2,253 Americans (including 561 reached via cell phone), evaluates the flip side of that phenomenon: the degree to which people are using the internet as a diversion and way to relax and take their minds off of their economic troubles. When asked whether they used the internet to relax and help get their minds off of the recent economic or financial problems, three-quarters (74%) of online economic users said they had done so. Listening to music and watching online videos are among the most common of the activities we evaluated; roughly half of all online economic users have done each of these activities to relax. Approximately one-third of online economic users have played online games or chatted with friends (on a social networking site, listserv or other online group), while an additional 22% have taken their minds off of their economic or financial circumstances by creating or posting content online. The youngest online economic users (those ages 18-29) are significantly more likely than other age groups to engage in a wide range of online relaxation activities. Among these young online economic users, three-quarters say that they go online to relax by watching online videos (74%) or listening to music online (73%); roughly half play online games (52%) or go online to chat with friends (55%); and two in five post their own original creations online. Although the youngest online economic users turn to the internet in the largest numbers to relax and take their minds off of the economy, those in other age groups tend to do so as well. For instance, among online economic users ages 30-49, more than half say they relax by watching online videos (58%) or listening to music online (52%); additionally, one-third play online games (34%) or chat with friends online (33%). There are few statistically significant differences between male and female online economic users. The exception is chatting with friends online: women (38%) are more likely to do this than men (27%). There are also few significant differences between online economic users based on race, education or household income. Interestingly, online economic users go online for relaxation or as a diversion at the same rate regardless of their own financial situation, or whether or not they have been personally impacted by the economic downturn. For these online economic users, going online as a diversion or relaxation tool is simply a standard feature of their lives, and not one that is necessarily tied to their personal economic circumstances. As noted above, many online economic users turn to the internet as a diversion; however, these individuals engage in a wide range of more serious online pursuits as well. For example, fully 76% of those who have gone online to relax or take their minds off of the economy have also gone online to find the lowest price on something they need to buy. Additionally: These individuals are also active in posting their own original online content: 10% of those who go online as a diversion have posted their comments about the recession in an online discussion group or other online forum, and 9% have done so on a blog (their own or someone else’s).","When asked whether they used the internet to relax and help get their minds off of the recent economic or financial problems , three - quarters ( 74 % ) of online economic users said they had done so .

Today, half of Latinos (51%) express satisfaction with the direction of the country, a 13 percentage point increase over 2011, when 38% said the same. One-third (33%) now report that their finances are in “excellent” or “good” shape, up from one-quarter (24%) who said the same in 2011. And looking forward, Latinos have grown more optimistic about their family’s finances in the next 12 months, with three-in-four (73%) expecting improvement, up from 67% who said the same in 2011. These changing assessments about finances and the country’s direction occur as some economic indicators recently have improved for Hispanics. In the third quarter of 2012, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 9.9%, down from 11.2% in the third quarter of 2011. The Hispanic unemployment rate is also now below its level at the end of the Great Recession in the third quarter of 2009, when it stood at 12.7%.1 The poverty rate among Hispanics has also declined, falling to 25.3% in 2011 from 26.5% in 2010 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor and Smith, 2012). However, other economic indicators illustrate the difficult times that Latinos have faced since the onset of the Great Recession. Driven mainly by the collapse in the housing market, median household wealth among Latinos declined by 58% between 2005 and 2010 (the latest year for which such figures are available), more than that of either whites (18%) or blacks (54%).2 In 2007, for the first time, the number of Latino children in poverty surpassed the number of white children or black children living in poverty (Lopez and Velasco, 2011). And by their own assessment, Latinos say they were hit harder by the recession than any other group (Taylor, Lopez, Velasco and Motel, 2012). Nonetheless, the Pew Hispanic survey finds that, compared with the public as a whole, Hispanics are more satisfied with the country’s direction. Just 31% of the general public (Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, 2012) says they are satisfied with how things are going in the country today, compared with 51% among Hispanics. When it comes to personal finances, Hispanics’ self-assessments, while improving, are not as positive as those of the general public. One-third (33%) of Hispanics say their current situation is “excellent” or “good” while 43% of the general public says the same. On the other hand, Hispanics are somewhat more optimistic than the general public about the future of their family finances. Some 73% of Hispanics say they think their finances will improve in the coming 12 months, while 67% of the general public says the same. During this year’s presidential campaign, the issue of jobs and the economy has been a top concern for Hispanics, just as it is for the general public. According to the Pew Hispanic survey, 47% of all Hispanics rate the issue as “extremely important” to them personally (Lopez and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2012). Among Hispanic registered voters, 54% rate jobs and the economy as extremely important. This report is based on a nationally representative bilingual telephone survey of 1,765 Latino adults with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The survey was fielded from September 7 to October 4, 2012, largely before the first presidential debate, which occurred on October 3, 2012. For a full description of the survey methodology, see Appendix B. The report is also based on a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey data. In addition, the report uses poverty and household income data published by the federal government. This report explores the economic attitudes and experiences of Hispanics. It is based on an analysis of several data sources. Hispanic attitudes and financial self-assessments are based on the 2012 National Survey of Latinos (NSL). The survey was conducted from September 7 through October 4, 2012, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia among a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1,765 Latino adults. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish on cellular as well as landline telephones. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Interviews were conducted for the Pew Hispanic Center by Social Science Research Solutions (SSRS). The report also contains an analysis of unemployment rate trends among Hispanics and other groups based on Pew Hispanic Center tabulations of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). In addition, statistics on poverty rates and median household income published by the federal government are used.

The survey also finds that for \t\tabout half of Hispanic registered voters (54%), a candidate’s position on immigration is not a deal-breaker in determining their vote  \t\t if that candidate shares their views on most other issues. Overall, 57% of Latino registered voters support the Democratic candidate in their congressional district or lean Democratic, while 28% favor the Republican candidate or lean Republican, a greater than two-to-one advantage for Democrats. But support for congressional Democrats is down from 2010, when 65% of Latino registered voters backed the Democrat in their congressional district and 22% favored the Republican candidate (Lopez, 2010). The survey reveals in other ways that Latino registered voters are somewhat less supportive of the Democratic Party now than in recent years. On political party identification, 63% today say they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, down from 70% who said the same in 2012. And when asked which political party has more concern for Latinos, 50% say the Democrats, down from 61% who said the same in 2012. Meanwhile, Republicans have made some progress among Hispanic voters. About one-quarter (27%) today say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Party. In 2012, 22% said the same. But Republican Party gains among Hispanic registered voters in terms of party identification do not extend to Hispanic voters’ views of the party. Just 10% say the Republican Party has more concern than the Democratic Party for the Hispanic community, unchanged since 2012. Instead, the share of Hispanic registered voters who say there is no difference between the two parties is up, to 35% today from 23% in 2012. The Latino vote has grown in importance in recent years and has played important roles in both of President Obama’s victories. In 2008, Obama won 67% of the Latino vote (Lopez, 2008). That share rose to 71% in 2012 (Lopez and Taylor, 2012). This year, a record 25.2 million Latinos are eligible to vote, though most live in states or congressional districts that do not have close races (Lopez, Krogstad, Patten and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2014). The past year has been characterized by inaction on immigration reform at the federal level. The U.S. House of Representatives did not take up a bi-partisan U.S. Senate immigration reform bill passed during the summer of 2013. And President Barack Obama’s summertime promise to use his executive powers to extend deportation relief to some of the nation’s 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants has been put on hold until after the November elections.1 Most Latino registered voters have heard about the president’s decision to delay any executive action on deportation relief for unauthorized immigrants, according to the survey. Two-thirds (68%) say they have heard either a lot (27%) or a little (41%) about it. But three-in-ten say they have heard nothing at all about the president’s decision. Among those who have heard about the president’s decision, the survey shows that about a third (35%) of Latino voters are either disappointed (26%) or angry (9%) about the delay. But about a quarter (26%) say they are pleased (19%) or very happy (7%) about it. The survey also shows that immigration reform is a priority for Hispanics. Two-thirds (66%) of Hispanic registered voters say it is extremely important (30%) or very important (36%) that the president and Congress pass significant new immigration legislation soon. Among all Hispanics, three-quarters (74%) say the same.2 When asked who is responsible for the lack of immigration reform this year, Latino registered voters place more blame on Republicans in Congress (45%) than congressional Democrats (14%) or President Obama (20%). By contrast, among all Latinos, just as many blame Republicans (40%) as blame either congressional Democrats (15%) or President Obama (24%). Yet the survey also shows that immigration is not a deal breaker issue for many Latino voters. Some 54% say they would vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on immigration policy if that candidate agrees with them on most other issues. Nonetheless, about one-third (36%) say they would not vote for a candidate if they disagreed with the candidate on immigration policy. Overall, the issue of immigration does not rate as high as some other issues among Hispanic voters. Instead, when asked about five issues that might be discussed in this year’s congressional campaign, more say education (92%), jobs and the economy (91%) and health care (86%) are extremely important or very important to them. By comparison, 73% say the same about immigration. Following immigration, 66% of Hispanics voters say the issue of conflicts in the Middle East is extremely or very important to them. Hispanic registered voters are just as motivated to vote and are paying as close attention to this year’s midterm elections as they were in 2010, according to the survey. About half (53%) of Hispanic registered voters say they are absolutely certain they will vote this year, unchanged from the 51% who said the same in 2010. And today 35% say they have given this year’s election “quite a lot” of thought compared with 32% who said the same in 2010. Even so, Latino registered voters are less motivated about voting than U.S. registered voters overall. A July Pew Research Center survey (2014c), found that 70% of all registered voters said they were absolutely certain they will vote this year. And an October Pew Research Center survey (2014e) found that 59% of all registered voters say they have given the election “quite a lot of thought.” Despite record turnout among Latinos in recent elections, Latino voter turnout rates have been below those of other groups. In 2010, a record 6.6 million Latinos voted. But that represented just 31.2% of Latino eligible voters, a share that lagged behind blacks (44%) and whites (48.6%) (Lopez, Krogstad, Patten and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2014).3 This report is based on a nationally representative bilingual telephone survey of 1,520 Hispanic adults, including 733 registered voters, conducted from Sept. 11 through Oct. 9, 2014, by the Pew Research Center. The survey was fielded after President Obama’s decision to delay any executive action extending deportation relief to more of the country’s unauthorized immigrants. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level; for registered voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points. Among the survey’s other findings:","But Republican Party gains among Hispanic registered voters in terms of party identification do not extend to Hispanic voters ’ views of the party .

Most disapprove of the job he has done outlining his plans for the country’s future and there remain widespread concerns about his potential conflicts of interest – though these concerns are somewhat lower than they were a month ago. In addition, Trump is at odds with the public over his tax returns: A wide majority says he has a responsibility to release his tax returns, a step he has yet to take. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults, finds that 39% approve of the job President-elect Trump has done so far explaining his policies and plans for the future to the American people, while a larger share (55%) say they disapprove. Overall ratings have changed little since December and remain highly partisan: 72% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve of the job he is doing, compared with just 13% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Also released today on Pew Research Center’s Fact Tank blog: “U.S. public sees Russian role in campaign hacking, but is divided over new sanctions.” With Trump likely to face questions on how he plans to separate himself from his business interests as president, 57% of the public says they are either very (33%) or somewhat (24%) concerned that his relationships with organizations, businesses or foreign governments conflict with his ability to serve the country’s best interests. However, public concern is lower than it was in the immediate aftermath of the election: In December, 65% said they were at least somewhat concerned about Trump’s ability to serve the country’s best interests. The share saying they are very concerned about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest is down 12 points, from 45% a month ago. A majority of Democrats (59%) are very concerned that Trump’s relationships conflict with his ability to serve the country’s best interests; just 7% of Republicans say the same. Both groups express less concern than they did in December: Democrats are 11 points less likely to say they are very concerned and Republicans are 6 points less likely to say this. While Trump has yet to release his personal tax returns, the public thinks that he has a responsibility to do so: 60% say this, compared with 33% who say he does not have a responsibility to release his tax returns. By 79% to 17%, more Democrats and Democratic leaners say Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns than say he does not. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 38% say he has a responsibility to do this, compared with 53% who say he does not have this responsibility. When it comes to making important decisions, most Americans (58%) think that Trump will be too impulsive, while 34% think he will be about right and just 4% think he will be too cautious in his decision-making. During the campaign, voters expressed concerns about Trump’s temperament: In October, 69% described him as “reckless” and 65% described him as “having poor judgment.” In the current survey, Republicans express confidence in Trump’s decision-making. Overall, 65% say they think Trump’s approach to making important decisions will be about right; roughly a quarter (28%) say he’ll be too impulsive. Conservative Republicans (74%) are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans (51%) to say they think Trump’s decision-making will be about right. By contrast, Democrats overwhelmingly say that Trump will be too impulsive in making important decisions: 84% say this, compared with just 9% who think his approach will be about right. A wide majority of liberal Democrats (94%) say Trump will be too impulsive; a somewhat smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same (77%). As confirmation hearings for Trump’s cabinet nominees begin, 41% say they approve of his cabinet choices and other high-level appointees, while 49% say that they disapprove. Views on this question are little changed from December. Trump receives much lower marks for both the job he has done explaining his plans and policies (39% approve) and for his cabinet choices (41% approve) than Obama received in 2009. Eight years ago, 70% approved of the job Obama had done explaining his plans and policies for the future and 66% said they approved of his cabinet selections. As reported in December, early ratings for Trump also trail those given to other recent presidents at similar points in their presidential transitions, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. Trump’s cabinet choices and other high level appointments are not well known to the public: In an open-ended question, just 34% can recall the name of any individual Trump has selected to serve in his administration. In January 2009, 65% could recall the name of a person Obama had selected for a role in his administration (a level of awareness that was driven in large party by familiarity with his pick for Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton). In January 2001, fewer than half (43%) could name an appointee of George W. Bush; and in January 1993, just 21% could identify a person Bill Clinton had nominated for his cabinet or other high-level post. Today, 10% volunteer the name of Jeff Sessions, Trump’s choice for attorney general, when asked to name an administration appointee. About as many can recall the name of Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State (Rex Tillerson, 9%) or his nominee for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Ben Carson, 9%). Fewer can recall the names of other Trump appointees. For example, just 3% volunteer the name Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive whom Trump named as his senior counselor and chief strategist. The public is divided over how active a role they see Trump playing in his administration: 50% say Trump will be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time, while 43% say other people will be really running the government. In January 2001, following the election of George W. Bush, a CBS/New York Times survey found that 38% thought Bush would be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time, compared with 53% who said other people would be really running the government. Views of Trump’s role vary greatly by partisan affiliation, as well as age. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump will be in charge of his administration, including 83% of conservative Republicans and a somewhat smaller 61%-majority of moderate and liberal Republicans. By contrast, 62% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think other people will really be running the government. Among Democrats, there are no differences in views on this question by ideology. Young adults under age 30 do not think Trump will be in charge most of the time: 64% say other people will really be running the government. By contrast, 67% of those ages 65 and older say that Trump will be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time. There are wide demographic differences in views of the job Trump has done so far explaining his plans and policies for the future. By 62% t0 33%, more women disapprove than approve of the job Trump has done. Among men, about as many say they approve of how Trump has outlined his plans (46%) as disapprove (48%). By more than two-to-one, blacks (69%-25%) and Hispanics (68%-27%) say they disapprove of the job Trump has done explaining his plans and policies to the American people. Whites are more evenly divided: 46% say they approve, while 49% disapprove. Clear majorities of those under age 50 say they disapprove of the job Trump has done so far laying out his vision for the country. By contrast, those age 50 and older are about as likely to say they approve of the job Trump has done so far than disapprove. Across levels of educational attainment, majorities of those with at least some college experience say they disapprove of the job Trump has done so far. Disapproval is especially high among those with a postgraduate degree (72%). By contrast, those with no more than a high school diploma are more positive in their views: 46% say they approve of the job Trump has done to this point, while 47% say they disapprove.","Trump receives much lower marks for both the job he has done explaining his plans and policies ( 39 % approve ) and for his cabinet choices ( 41 % approve ) than Obama received in 2009 .

As of mid-2017, 8% of Americans say they own a drone and 59% say they have seen one in action, according to a Pew Research Center survey. But while drones – that is, aircraft without on-board human pilots – are more prevalent than they were a few years ago, many have reservations about where and under what circumstances their use should be allowed. The survey shows modest differences in rates of ownership by gender and age. Slightly more men (11%) than women (6%) say they own a drone, as do more people ages 18 to 49 (12%) compared with those 50 and older (4%). Americans vary in how they react to the sight of a drone nearby and what rules they think should be applied to them. Asked how they would feel if they saw a drone flying close to where they live, relatively large shares of Americans say they would be curious (58%) or interested (45%). At the same time, around one-in-four (26%) say they would be nervous, and around one-in-ten say this would make them feel angry (12%) or scared (11%). When it comes to what rules should apply to drone use, roughly half the public (54%) thinks drones should not be allowed to fly near people’s homes. Just 11% think this should be allowed, while 34% think it is OK in certain circumstances but not others. Around half of the public (53%) says private citizens should not be allowed to pilot drones near accidents or crime scenes, while a plurality (45%) says this practice should not be allowed at public events like concerts or rallies. By comparison, Americans are more broadly accepting of drone use by private citizens in locations such as beaches or public parks. Still, a significant number of Americans do not have hard and fast rules about whether people should be able to fly drones in various locations. For each of the possible locations for drone use asked about in the survey, roughly one-quarter to one-third of Americans say it depends on the circumstances as to whether citizens should be allowed to pilot drones in that location or not. Older Americans often have substantially more negative – and less permissive – attitudes toward drones than do younger adults. For instance, 25% of 18- to 29-year-olds say they would feel indifferent if they saw a drone flying near their home, but that share falls to just 6% among those 65 and older. By the same token, just 5% of young adults – but 17% of those 65 and older – say they would feel angry in this situation. Older Americans are also much more likely to think that drone use by private citizens should be banned in certain areas – most notably, near people’s homes (73% of older adults think this should not be allowed) or at events such as concerts or rallies (67%). Government data provide other indicators about how drones have worked their way into everyday life and instances where they have been used in areas that are off-limits. As of May 2017, more than 820,000 operators had registered their unmanned aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, according to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. That number represents only a portion of the drones in use, because until recently, FAA rules stated that only drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds had to be registered, and many consumer models did not meet that weight requirement. Additionally, reports to the FAA of drone sightings in unauthorized areas have grown in recent years. The agency has been tracking reports of unmanned aircraft sightings around planes, airports and other unauthorized areas since November 2014. A Pew Research Center analysis of those data shows that through the first nine months of 2017, the FAA had received an average of 155 such reports per month. This represents a 24% increase compared with the same time period in 2016, and an 86% increase compared with the same period in 2015. Note: A sentence in this post on FAA rules was updated on Jan. 4, 2018, to reflect recent congressional action.

Perhaps surprisingly, though, the most commonly cited motivation for these workers is not the pay. Our survey asked those who have earned money through digital employment platforms – such as ride-hailing apps or various digital task sites – why they take on this type of work. They cited a number of reasons, from helping to fill in gaps in their other sources of income (37% mentioned this) to needing ways to earn money that could fit into the other demands on their time (30%). But the number one motivation, cited by 42% of respondents, was fun, or because the work gives them something to do in their spare time. A closer examination of this group highlights several themes that speak to the significant diversity in the broader gig economy. First, many of these “platform earners” engage in this work for a variety of reasons. Among those who are motivated by a desire to have fun or for something to do in their spare time, around one-quarter (27%) also say that they engage in this work to help fill gaps or fluctuations in their other income. Meanwhile, around one-in-five say they are also motivated by a desire to gain work experience (19%) or because of a lack of other jobs in their area (17%), while 15% cite the need to control their own schedule due to other obligations. Second, those who take on gig work for this reason engage in a wide range of jobs and tasks – including some that many Americans might not immediately think of as fun. Overwhelmingly, this group gravitates toward online tasks that might be completed on sites such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: 69% say that they have earned money in the past year performing online tasks on these platforms. But just under one-in-five have earned money in the past year by shopping for or delivering household items (18%), doing chores like cleaning or laundry (17%), or driving for a ride-hailing service (16%). Third, just because they are motivated in part by a desire to pass the time does not mean that the income they earn is not important to them. Three-in-five of these earners (62%) say that the income they earn from their platform work is nice to have, but that they could live comfortably without it. But around one-in-five say this income is either essential to meeting their basic needs (20%) or at minimum an important component of their overall budget (18%). In the end, these findings highlight the extent to which participants in the digital gig economy cover a wide spectrum of characteristics and a diverse range of motivations – from dedicated workers who rely heavily on their income to hobbyists for whom financial considerations are of secondary importance to doing something they love.","Our survey asked those who have earned money through digital employment platforms – such as ride - hailing apps or various digital task sites – why they take on this type of work .

But for some institutions – such as churches and the news media – Millennials’ opinions have become markedly more negative in the past five years. Since 2010, Millennials’ rating of churches and other religious organizations has dipped 18 percentage points: 55% now say churches have a positive impact on the country compared with five years ago, when nearly three-quarters (73%) said this. Views among older generations have changed little over this time period. As a result, older generations are now more likely than Millennials – who are much less likely than their elders to be religious – to view religious organizations positively. Millennials’ views of the national news media also have grown more negative. In 2010, four-in-ten Millennials said the national news media was having a positive impact on the way things were going in the country, a far more positive view than among older generations (just 27% of Silents and Baby Boomers and 29% of Generation Xers said this). But now, Millennials’ evaluations of the news media have grown more critical and are currently on par with older generations: Just 27% now say it has a positive impact, compared with 26% of Xers and Silents and 23% of Boomers. Younger generations tend to have more-positive views than their elders about small and large businesses as well as financial institutions and labor unions. Views of each of these institutions have grown more favorable over the past five years. Banks and financial institutions continue to be viewed more negatively than positively among adults overall (47% vs. 40%), yet nearly twice as many as in 2010 now say they have a positive impact (40% today, 22% then). And these more-positive impressions are seen across generations: Five years ago, just 35% of Millennials said banks had a positive impact on the nation; today 45% say this. Evaluations of large corporations have similarly improved among Millennials, though they also remain more negative than positive. Small businesses were viewed positively by majorities across all generations in 2010, and those views have only grown more positive in recent years. For instance, 86% of Millennials now say small businesses have a positive effect, up 15 points since 2010. Labor unions are also seen more positively today than they were five years ago (45% now say they have a positive impact on the country, up from 32% in 2010). And Millennials remain much more likely than their elders, especially members of the Silent Generation, to view unions positively: More than half (57%) of Millennials say this, compared with 42% of Gen Xers, 41% of Baby Boomers and just 28% of Silents. Millennials also have more positive views of colleges and universities than those in older generations. Nearly three-quarters of Millennials (73%) say colleges and universities have a positive impact, compared with 64% of Generation Xers, 59% of Boomers and just 51% of Silents.

While about half of Americans (48%) view the energy industry as having a positive impact on the country, this view is somewhat more common among those in younger generations than older: 54% of Millennials and 52% of Xers say this, compared with just 42% of Boomers and 35% of Silents.","Millennials ’ views of the national news media also have grown more negative .

There are signs, though, of a turning tide: Younger newsroom employees show greater racial, ethnic and gender diversity than their older colleagues, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. More than three-quarters (77%) of newsroom employees – those who work as reporters, editors, photographers and videographers in the newspaper, broadcasting and internet publishing industries – are non-Hispanic whites, according to the analysis of 2012-2016 American Community Survey data. That is true of 65% of U.S. workers in all occupations and industries combined. Newsroom employees are also more likely than workers overall to be male. About six-in-ten newsroom employees (61%) are men, compared with 53% of all workers. When combining race/ethnicity and gender, almost half (48%) of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white men compared with about a third (34%) of workers overall. The disparity in race and ethnicity exists across all age groups. Non-Hispanic whites account for about three-fourths (74%) of newsroom employees ages 18 to 49, and they represent 85% among those 50 and older. These shares are lower among workers overall. When it comes to gender, however, younger newsroom employees look like U.S. employees overall. Newsroom employees ages 18 to 29 are just as likely as workers overall to be men (51% in both groups). Among older workers, newsroom employees are disproportionately male: About two-thirds of newsroom employees ages 30 and older are men, compared with a little over half of all U.S. workers. Putting these demographic measures together, 38% of the youngest newsroom employees are both non-Hispanic white and male. This is still a higher share than among workers overall (30%), but this 8-percentage-point gap is smaller than among older age groups. Newsroom employees age 50 and older are 17 percentage points more likely to be white men than all workers in the same age group, while those ages 30 to 49 are 15 points more likely. The racial, ethnic and gender differences by age are notable because the bulk of newsroom employees are in the younger age groups. About seven-in-ten newsroom employees are younger than 50: 28% are ages 18 to 29 and 42% are ages 30 to 49. Only about three-in-ten newsroom employees are 50 and older. These data for all newsroom employees tend to correspond with data on specific media sectors. For example, newsroom surveys conducted by the American Society of News Editors in 2012-2015 estimated that newspaper employees were 87%-88% white, 63%-64% male, and 56%-57% white and male. Surveys by the Radio Television Digital News Association in 2012-2016 estimated that television newsroom staff were 77%-79% white and 56%-60% male, while radio newsroom staff were 87%-91% white and 61%-69% male.

Slightly lower shares on both sides of the Atlantic say they would be willing to accept a Muslim as a family member. At the same time, there is no consensus on whether Islam fits into these societies. Across Western Europe, people are split on Islam’s compatibility with their country’s culture and values, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey. And in the U.S., public opinion remains about evenly divided on whether Islam is part of mainstream American society and if Islam is compatible with democracy, according to a 2017 poll. The vast majority of non-Muslim Americans (89%) say they would be willing to accept Muslims as neighbors, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The same survey finds that most people (79%) say they would be willing to accept Muslims as members of their family. In Western Europe,  most people also say they would be willing to accept Muslim neighbors. However, Europeans are less likely than Americans to say they would be willing to accept Muslims as family members. While about two-thirds of non-Muslim French people (66%) say they would accept a Muslim in their family, just over half of British (53%), Austrian (54%) and German (55%) adults say this. Italians are the least likely in Europe to say they would be willing to accept a Muslim family member (43%). Surveys in both the U.S. and Western Europe were conducted on the telephone, and due to the tendency of some respondents to give socially acceptable responses, may overstate the share of people willing to accept others (also known as social desirability bias). In both the U.S. and Europe, the surveys find higher acceptance of Muslims among those with more education. In the U.S., for example, 86% of adults with a college degree would be willing to accept a Muslim into their family; among Americans without a college degree, this share falls to 75%. Similarly, in Germany, a majority of those with a college education (67%) say they would be willing to accept a Muslim in their family, compared with roughly half (52%) among those without one. The same pattern is present in other countries, such as the UK (71% vs. 44%) and Austria (67% vs. 51%). On both sides of the Atlantic, attitudes toward Muslims are tied to politics, even after taking education, age and other demographic factors into account. In Western Europe, those who lean toward the right of the European political spectrum have less accepting views than those who lean toward the left. Likewise, in the U.S., those who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say they would be willing to accept a Muslim family member (88% vs. 67%). Still, majorities among both Democrats and Republicans say they would be willing to accept Muslims in their lives. Additional analysis of how other demographic factors (such as religion) are correlated with these kinds of attitudes in Europe can be found here. While majorities of Americans and Western Europeans have accepting views toward Muslims, they are more divided on whether to accept Islam in their societies. Europeans in several countries are about as likely to say, “Islam is fundamentally incompatible with [their country’s] culture and values” as they are to take the view that “there is no fundamental contradiction between Islam and [their country’s] culture and values.” This is the case, for example, in Germany – where 44% of Germans see a fundamental contradiction between Islam and German culture and values, compared with 46% who do not see a contradiction. In the UK, public opinion also is divided on this question. Pew Research Center has not asked this exact question in the U.S. Still, several other survey questions point to a similar ambivalence in American public opinion about the role of Islam in society. For instance, half of American adults say Islam is not part of mainstream American society and a similar share (44%) say there is a natural conflict between Islam and democracy. Muslims make up roughly 1% of the adult population in the U.S., while across Europe as a whole (including Eastern Europe), they are estimated to form roughly 5% of the population, including 6% in the UK and Germany, and nearly 9% in France. Also, 46% of American adults say they personally know a Muslim, compared with significant majorities in most Western European countries, including 71% in the UK and 79% in France.","Muslims make up roughly 1 % of the adult population in the U.S. , while across Europe as a whole ( including Eastern Europe ) , they are estimated to form roughly 5 % of the population , including 6 % in the UK and Germany , and nearly 9 % in France .

This is virtually unchanged from the 51% who were middle class in 2011. But while the size of the nation’s middle class remained relatively stable, financial gains for middle-income Americans during this period were modest compared with those of higher-income households, causing the income disparity between the groups to grow. The recent stability in the share of adults living in middle-income households marks a shift from a decades-long downward trend. From 1971 to 2011, the share of adults in the middle class fell by 10 percentage points. But that shift was not all down the economic ladder. Indeed, the increase in the share of adults who are upper income was greater than the increase in the share who are lower income over that period, a sign of economic progress overall. Financially, middle-class households in the U.S. were better off in 2016 than in 2010. The median income of middle-class households increased from $74,015 in 2010 to $78,442 in 2016, by 6%. Upper-income households (where 19% of American adults live) fared better than the middle class, as their median income increased from $172,152 to $187,872, a gain of 9% over this period. Lower-income households (29% of adults) experienced an income gain of 5%, about the same as the middle class. (Incomes are adjusted for household size, scaled to reflect three-person households, and expressed in 2016 dollars.) But, recent gains notwithstanding, the median income of middle-class households in 2016 was about the same as in 2000, a reflection of the lingering effects of the Great Recession and an earlier recession in 2001. The median income of lower-income households in 2016 ($25,624) was less than in 2000 ($26,923). Only the incomes of upper-income households increased from 2000 to 2016, from $183,680 to $187,872. The widening income gap between upper-income households and middle- and lower-income households this century is the continuation of a decades-long trend. In 1970, the first year covered by earlier Pew Research Center analyses, the median income of upper-income households was 2.2 times the income of middle-income households and 6.3 times the income of lower-income households. These income ratios increased to 2.4 and 7.3 in 2016, respectively. A recent Pew Research Center analysis also found that the wealth gaps between upper-income families and lower- and middle-income families in 2016 were at the highest levels recorded. Although the wealth of upper-income families has more than recovered from the losses experienced during the Great Recession, the wealth of lower- and middle-income families in 2016 was comparable to 1989 levels. Thus, even as the American middle class appears not to be shrinking (for now), it continues to fall further behind upper-income households financially, mirroring the long-running rise in income inequality in the U.S. overall. The period from 2011 to 2016 encompasses much of the economic expansion following the Great Recession of 2007-09. But the recovery has been slow (the slowest in modern times) and that may help explain the lack of movement of adults into upper-income households during this period. The nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita did not return to its pre-recession peak (near the end of 2007) until the latter half of 2013. Likewise, the median income of U.S. households took until 2016 to return to where it stood prior to the start of the Great Recession in December 2007. The share of adults who are middle class varies widely across U.S. metropolitan areas. The estimated share was highest in Sheboygan, WI, where 65% of adults lived in middle-income households in 2016, and it was the lowest in Laredo, TX, where 39% of adults were in middle-income households. The 10 areas with the highest concentrations of middle class adults are located in the Midwest or the Northeast, with the exception of Ogden-Clearfield, UT. These areas are also more reliant on manufacturing than the nation overall. (See our earlier analysis of U.S. metropolitan areas for more detail on the characteristics of these areas.) The metropolitan areas with the largest shares of adults in upper-income households are mostly in the coastal areas of the Northeast and California. They tend to be in high-tech corridors, such as Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH, or in financial and commercial centers, such as Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT. San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA, where 32% of adults were upper-income, led among all areas in 2016. The area with the smallest share who are upper income is Lewiston-Auburn, ME (8%). The metropolitan areas with the largest shares of lower-income adults are located primarily in the Southwest, with several on the southern border, such as McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX, and include farming communities in central California, such as Fresno, CA. In Laredo, TX, about half of adults (49%) lived in lower-income households in 2016, the highest share in the country. Ogden-Clearfield, UT, among the largest middle-class communities, also had the lowest share of lower-income adults (19%) in 2016. In our analysis, “middle-income” Americans are adults whose annual household income is two-thirds to double the national median, after incomes have been adjusted for household size. In 2016, the national middle-income range was about $45,200 to $135,600 annually for a household of three. Lower-income households had incomes less than $45,200 and upper-income households had incomes greater than $135,600 (incomes in 2016 dollars).

But in many cases, targets of online harassment name someone they know personally as the responsible party. About one-in-four Americans (26%) who have been harassed online say an acquaintance was behind their most recent incident, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. And in other cases, targets of online abuse are even more familiar with their harassers: 18% of those who have been harassed say their most recent incident involved a friend, while 11% say it involved a family member. Smaller shares say their most recent experience involved a former romantic partner (7%) or a co-worker (5%). Taken together, nearly half of Americans (46%) who have experienced some form of online harassment say they know the person or persons responsible for their most recent incident – the same as the share (46%) who say their harasser was a stranger or someone whose real identity was unknown to them. (The remaining 8% were harassed by people both known and unknown to them.) The severity of harassment people encounter varies little by whether or not they know their harasser. But there are some distinct differences in how these two groups react to their experiences. Those who know their harasser tend to be more deeply affected by their experience and to express greater concerns for their safety. Among those harassed online by someone they know, 34% describe their most recent incident as extremely or very upsetting – twice the share among those who say their harasser was unknown to them (17%). Additionally, people harassed online by someone they know are roughly three times as likely to say they felt a threat of physical danger to themselves or people close to them during their most recent incident (17% vs. 5%). Those who know their harasser are also more likely to say the incident caused a range of problems, including difficulties with friends or family, damage to their reputation, mental or emotional stress or problems in their romantic relationships. A majority of both groups say they simply ignored their most recent incident of online abuse. But slightly larger shares of those who are familiar rather than unfamiliar with their harasser say they did respond in some way (45% vs. 34%). Among people who chose to respond, those who were harassed by someone known to them were especially likely to say they confronted the person face-to-face or over the phone (28% vs. 1% among those who did not know their harasser), changed their username or deleted an online profile (15% vs. 3%), or stopped going to offline events or places (11% vs. 3%). Those who have been harassed by someone they know are also more likely to turn to others for support: 55% sought out some type of help or support during their most recent indident, compared with 31% of those who were harassed by a stranger or somone anonymous. This group is especially likely to turn to other friends or family members for support: 39% did so after their most recent encounter, compared with 16% of those whose harasser was unknown to them.","About one - in - four Americans ( 26 % ) who have been harassed online say an acquaintance was behind their most recent incident , according to a recent Pew Research Center report .

And today — with Obama’s overall approval rating at 51%, the highest in nearly three years – the generation gap in approval is among the widest since he took office in 2009. About six-in-ten (62%) Millennials (adults born after 1980) approve of the job Obama is doing. By comparison, half of Generation Xers (born 1965-1980), 43% of Boomers (born 1946-1964) and just 37% of Silents (born 1928-1945) offer positive ratings of the president’s job performance. There has been a generation gap – the difference between the youngest group, Millennials, and the oldest, Silents – in ratings of Obama for much of the last seven years. But the gap has fluctuated widely over this period. Throughout much of 2014, Obama’s approval ratings among Millennials hovered near 50%, compared with the roughly 35% of Silents who approved of Obama. Over the past year, Obama’s ratings among Millennials have risen, while the ratings of older generations (particularly Boomers and Silents) are little changed. When it comes to education level, the president enjoys substantially more support from those with college degrees, and particularly those with postgraduate degrees. Today, 62% of those with postgraduate degrees approve of his job performance, along with 54% of those with bachelor’s degrees. Among adults with some college experience but no degree, 47% approve, as do 49% of those with no more than a high school degree. As has been the case throughout Obama’s presidency, blacks are overwhelmingly positive of his job performance: Currently, 91% approve of his handling of his job as president. Similarly, the president garners positive ratings among Hispanics. Today, 65% of Hispanics approve of his job performance. However, whites continue to be more likely to disapprove (56%) than approve (38%) of the president’s performance, as they have been throughout most of his presidency. As in the past, Democrats continue to overwhelming approve of Obama, with fully 85% saying they approve of the way he is handling his job as president in the most recent survey. Conversely, Republicans rate Obama much more negatively. Just 11% say they approve of the president, while 85% say they disapprove. Democratic approval of Obama is as high as it has ever been, while Republican approval is as low as it has been over the last seven years. About half of political independents (48%) say they approve of the president. Obama’s overall job approval rating stands at 51%, while 44% disapprove. His current job rating places him just below Bill Clinton’s (57% approved) in March of his final year in office, and is nearly identical to Ronald Reagan’s at a similar point in his presidency (50%). Clinton finished his presidency with an approval rating of 61%, while Reagan rallied in his final year to finish at 63%. In March 2008, just 28% approved of George W. Bush’s job performance, while 63% disapproved. Bush finished his presidency with an approval rating of 24%.

And majorities of both Republicans and Democrats now express favorable views of the FBI, reflecting a rebound in GOP perceptions after a decline in recent years. Of the 16 agencies asked about in a national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 5-16 among 2,004 U.S. adults, 14 are viewed more favorably than unfavorably by the public. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the sole agency asked about in the survey viewed more negatively (54% unfavorable) than positively (42% favorable), while the public is divided in its view of the Department of Education (48% favorable, 48% unfavorable). Attitudes toward ICE continue to largely break along partisan lines: While 70% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have a favorable view of the agency, just 19% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same. Wide majorities of Democrats and Republicans report having a favorable opinion of the Postal Service, the National Park Service, NASA, the CDC and the Census Bureau. Democrats continue to view the IRS more favorably than Republicans do (59% vs. 49%). And while majorities of both Democrats and Republicans express positive views of the Social Security Administration and the Federal Reserve, Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to rate these agencies positively. In contrast, Republicans are now more likely than Democrats to offer a favorable opinion of the Department of Justice (DOJ), reflecting substantial shifts in opinion in both parties. About half of Democrats now express a favorable view (49%) of the DOJ, an 11 percentage point decline since last year and down from the nearly three-quarters of Democrats who viewed the department positively in January 2017. Republicans’ views of the Justice Department have become more positive over this time period: 61% of Republicans now say they view the DOJ favorably, up from 47% in January 2017. Republican views of the FBI have rebounded after declining in 2018: About two-thirds of Republicans (66%) now say they have a favorable opinion of the FBI – up 17 percentage points since last July, but on par with views of the bureau in 2016 and early 2017. Democratic opinions of the FBI are little changed in recent years, with roughly three-quarters (77%) continuing to say they view the bureau favorably. Today, roughly half of both Democrats (47%) and Republicans (48%) express a favorable view of the Department of Education. This marks a shift from surveys conducted throughout the Obama administration, when Democrats were consistently more likely than Republicans to view the department favorably. A similar pattern is evident in opinions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In surveys conducted between 2010 and January 2017, there was a wide partisan gap in views of the agency: By margins of 20 percentage points or more, Democrats had more favorable views of the EPA than Republicans. That partisan gap is substantially narrower today. Americans continue to be split in their preferences for the size and scope of government: 48% of adults say they would rather have a smaller government with fewer services provided, while 46% say they would prefer a bigger government with more services. This balance of opinion is little changed since 2017. Views about the size of government vary by demographics and partisanship. While a 56% majority of men say they would prefer a smaller government, just 40% of women say the same. A narrow majority of adults ages 18 to 29 report they would rather have a bigger government with more services to a smaller government (54% vs. 43%). Those ages 30 to 49 are roughly evenly divided in their preferences (46% bigger, 49% smaller), while those 50 and older are somewhat more likely to say they would prefer a smaller government with fewer services over a bigger government (51% vs. 41%). Partisans remain starkly divided on this question: About three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners (77%) would rather have a smaller government with fewer services, while roughly seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (69%) would rather have a bigger government with more services.","Americans continue to be split in their preferences for the size and scope of government : 48 % of adults say they would rather have a smaller government with fewer services provided , while 46 % say they would prefer a bigger government with more services .","Comment on public opinion of preferred size and scope of government?","48 % of adults say they would rather have a smaller government with fewer services provided , while 46 % say they would prefer a bigger government with more services .","48 % of adults say they would rather have a smaller government with fewer services provided , while 46 % say they would prefer a bigger government with more services ."],"1629":["1629.png","Despite Saudi Arabia's importance in the Islamic world, it ranks 16th in Muslim population Largest Muslim populations (in millions) ","Since his father became Saudi Arabia’s king in 2015, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has taken dramatic steps to change his country’s political and economic life. But the 32-year-old heir to the throne also has begun to soften the kingdom’s strict religious rules with a promise to return to “moderate Islam.” Among the changes he’s spearheaded: granting women the right to drive, reintroducing cinemas and curbing the sweeping powers of the religious police. Here are five facts about religion in Saudi Arabia — a country that is the birthplace of Islam and, as such, holds special importance for Muslims worldwide. 1Saudi Arabia has a young and rapidly growing Muslim population. The kingdom has more than 30 million inhabitants, and roughly 93% of them are Muslim, according to Pew Research Center data. The country is officially a Muslim nation and most Saudi Muslims are Sunni. However, a Shia minority accounts for an estimated 10% to 15% of the population. Additionally, Saudi Arabia is a young country: In 2015, about 56% of the kingdom’s Muslims were under the age of 30. The number of Muslims in Saudi Arabia is projected to increase 51% between 2015 and 2050, though their share of the global Muslim population is expected to remain small at about 2%. 2Saudi Arabia is home to two of Islam’s holiest cities: Mecca, where the Prophet Muhammad was born, and Medina, where he is buried. Every year, during the hajj, millions of Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca to complete the six-day pilgrimage to the Kaaba shrine. While the hajj is required once in the lifetime of every able-bodied adult Muslim who can afford it, adherents of the faith also travel to Mecca during other times of the year to complete the shorter, voluntary umrah pilgrimage. 3The Saudi Arabian government follows an ultraconservative Wahhabi interpretation of the Quran. Wahhabism began as a social and religious reform movement in the 18th century and is closely associated with the founding and consolidation of the Saudi kingdom.  Wahhabism calls for the literal interpretation of the Quran and includes strict enforcement of religious codes and practices. For decades, the Wahhabi doctrine has been upheld by clerics who run the judiciary and by religious police. But, recently, Crown Prince Mohammed has been pushing back against the clerical establishment and has even stripped the religious police of the power to make arrests. 4Government restrictions on religion are “very high” in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center report that looked at religious restrictions as of 2015. The kingdom is one of 23 countries out of 198 included in the study to earn this distinction, along with countries like China, Egypt and Iran. The desert kingdom falls in this top category of restrictions because it meets many of the Center’s criteria; for example, the constitution doesn’t allow for religious freedom, the government interferes with worship practices, and religious symbols – such as dress – are regulated by law. Saudi Arabia also has a “high” rating on our Social Hostilities Index, which measures aggression by private individuals, organizations or groups in society, such as religion-related harassment and terrorism. 5Young Saudi women are among the most educated in the Muslim world. Despite laws that require women to have a male guardian – a restriction that generally hampers their social mobility and access to jobs – young Saudi women are more educated than their male counterparts. As of 2010, about a third (35%) of Saudi women ages 25 to 34 held at least postsecondary degrees, compared with 28% of men, according to a Pew Research Center report. That’s a big change from previous generations. For example, only 3% of Saudi women ages 55 to 74 had gained higher education, versus 16% of men in that age group. While this recent educational progress hasn’t brought Saudi women up to the level of the U.S., for example, where 48% of women ages 25 to 34 had a postsecondary degree, Saudi Arabia is nevertheless ahead of other power brokers in the region such as Egypt (19%) and Iran (16%).","Saudi Arabia has a young and rapidly growing Muslim population .

Large number ofrefugees well-being leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria is a to the well-being ofthe U.S. (%) Major threat Minor threat Not a threat","Before President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting the U.S. refugee program, Americans were sharply divided over the threat that refugees from countries such as Iraq and Syria posed to the United States. In early January, the partisan gap in these opinions was wide, but the age gap was about as large – and had widened since last year. Trump’s executive order suspended refugee admissions for 120 days and barred entry by Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also temporarily blocked people from Iraq, Syria and five other countries in the Middle East and North Africa from entering the U.S. In early January, 46% of the public said “a large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria” was a major threat to the well-being of the U.S. About a third (35%) considered this a minor threat, while 16% said this was not a threat. Other international threats ranked higher. About eight-in-ten Americans (79%) called ISIS a major threat, 71% said the same about cyberattacks from other countries and 64% called North Korea’s nuclear program a major threat, according to the survey, conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults. Older adults were far more likely than young people to view the large number of refugees from Iraq and Syria as a major threat. A majority of adults 50 and older (58%) viewed the large number of refugees from nations such as Iraq and Syria as a major threat, compared with 43% of those ages 35 to 49 and just 31% of those younger than 35. About twice as many Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (63%) as Democrats and Democratic leaners (30%) said they considered refugees to be a major threat to the country. The ideological differences were even more pronounced: 70% of conservative Republicans and Republican leaners said refugees represented a major threat, compared with just 19% of liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners. Overall, the share of adults who said refugees from Iraq and Syria posed a major threat fell by 9 percentage points between April 2016 and last month, especially among younger adults. Last month’s survey also found age differences in both parties in views of the threat from Iraqi and Syrian refugees. Fewer than half of Republicans younger than 35 (45%) said these refugees were a major threat, compared with 78% of Republicans ages 65 and older. Among Democrats, just 21% of those younger than 35 saw refugees as a major threat, about half the share among those 65 and older (41%).","In early January , 46 % of the public said “ a large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria ” was a major threat to the well - being of the U.S. About a third ( 35 % ) considered this a minor threat , while 16 % said this was not a threat .

Among the disputes: whether men predominate in gaming; whether games portray women and minorities poorly; whether violent games promote aggressive behavior; and whether games encourage positive attributes such as problem-solving skills, communication and teamwork. A new survey from Pew Research Center covers these and other issues. The key results: About half of American adults (49%) “ever play video games on a computer, TV, game console, or portable device like a cellphone,” and 10% consider themselves to be “gamers.” A majority of American adults (60%) believe that most people who play video games are men – a view that is shared by 57% of women who themselves play video games. But the data illustrates that in some ways this assumption is wrong: A nearly identical share of men and women report ever playing video games (50% of men and 48% of women). However, men are more than twice as likely as women to call themselves “gamers” (15% vs. 6%). And among those ages 18 to 29, 33% of men say the term “gamer” describes them well, more than three times the proportion of young women (9%) who say the same. Americans are relatively divided over whether there is a possible link between violent games and actual violence. A slight majority of the public (53%) disagree with the statement “people who play violent video games are more likely to be violent themselves.” But 40% agree that there is a relationship between video game violence and violent behavior. Some 32% of those who play video games themselves see a connection between games and violence, along with 26% of self-identified gamers. Women are more likely than men to agree (by a 47% to 31% margin) that people who play violent games are more likely to be violent themselves. The public is closely split on some other major debates surrounding the content of games and their impact on users. For instance, a quarter of all adults (26%) think most video games are a waste of time, while 24% think most games are not a waste of time. One-third think some games are a waste of time while others are not. And 16% of the public is unsure what to think about this issue. A similar pattern is evident on the question of whether or not “most games help develop good problem solving and strategic thinking skills.” Some 17% of adults think this is true of most games, while 16% think this is not true of most games. Additionally, 47% think this is true of some games but not others, and 20% are not sure. Asked whether games promote teamwork and communication, 23% of adults do not think most games promote these traits – more than double the 10% who think most games do promote these qualities. Some 37% think some games but not others promote teamwork and communication, while 28% say they are unsure. Similarly, 30% of adults do not think most games are a better form of entertainment than TV, almost triple the 11% who think this is true. The public is much less certain on other aspects of gaming. Fully 47% of all adults are unsure if most video games portray minorities poorly, while 40% are unsure if most video games portray women poorly. Those who play video games themselves are more likely than non-game players to think positively about gaming: Game players are also particularly likely to disagree with negative portrayals of video games:","About half of American adults ( 49 % ) “ ever play video games on a computer , TV , game console , or portable device like a cellphone , ” and 10 % consider themselves to be “ gamers . ”","What are opinions among American adults about playing video games ?","About half of American adults ( 49 % ) “ ever play video games on a computer , TV , game console , or portable device like a cellphone , ” and 10 % consider themselves to be “ gamers . ”","About half of American adults ( 49 % ) “ ever play video games on a computer , TV , game console , or portable device like a cellphone , ” and 10 % consider themselves to be “ gamers . ”"],"6460":["6460.png","Views on Scientific Understanding of GM crops understanding % of U.S. adults who say scientists have a clear/not clear understanding of the health effects of GM crops","This coming weekend’s conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will feature a significant number of discussions about how the public thinks about science issues and how scientists communicate about their work. The Pew Research Center will be presenting new findings at the conference about the ways scientists engage with the public and media. There has been considerable interest in specific demographic breakdowns of the general public’s answers to science-related questions that Pew Research covered in its recent report on science issues and the gaps between citizens and scientists’ opinions on a range of issues. Here are additional demographic breakdowns of views among the general public based on a nationally representative survey of 2,002 U.S. adults conducted August 15-25, 2014. The margin of error for results based on the full sample is +/- 3.1 percentage points. For details on the survey methodology, including margins of error for key subgroups, see Appendix A. By a 57%-37% margin, the public believes that genetically-modified foods (GM foods) are generally unsafe to eat. This is a major contrast with scientists Pew Research surveyed. Some 3,748 U.S.-based members of the AAAS were surveyed from September 11 to October 13, 2014 and they said such foods were generally safe to eat by an 88%-11% margin. The nearby chart of the data from the survey of the general public shows several patterns. Those more likely to think genetically modified food is unsafe include: women, African-Americans and Hispanics, and those without college degrees. There are no statistically significant differences on the safety of eating GM Foods between Republicans and those who lean to the Republican Party as compared with Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party. Nor are there differences on this issue among political ideology groups. Pew Research will issue a detailed report on public attitudes about science-related topics by political groups later this spring. Survey respondents were asked: “From what you’ve heard or read, would you say scientists have a clear understanding of the health effects of genetically modified crops or are scientists not clear about this?” Two-thirds (67%) of adults say scientists do not have a clear understanding, while 28% say scientists have a clear understanding of the health effects. Those more likely to think scientists do not have a clear understanding of the health effects of GM crops include: women and older Americans. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks are more likely than Hispanics to say scientists do not have a clear understanding of this. Those in the general public survey were asked: “When you are food shopping, how often, if ever, do you look to see if the products are genetically modified?” Some 25% say they always look for such labels; 25% say they do so sometimes; 17% say they do so “not too often”; and 31% say they never look for GM labeling. Men are more likely than women to say they never look for GM labels. There are modest differences across other subgroups on this question as shown in the nearby table. Respondents in the survey were asked: “Thinking about childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella and polio, should parents be able to decide not to vaccinate their children or should all children be required to be vaccinated?” About two-thirds (68%) of adults say vaccinations should be required and 30% say parents should be able to decide. By contrast, 86% of AAAS scientists say all children should be required to be vaccinated. In the general public survey, those more likely to say parents should be able to decide include younger adults, Republicans and independents. There are no significant differences in views about this issue by gender, education or race and ethnicity. A separate Pew Research survey found substantial agreement among adults that vaccines for diseases such measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are safe for healthy children: 83% take that position. There were no differences among partisans on the general safety of such vaccines. The Pew Research survey asked: “Which comes closer to your view? Humans and other living things have evolved over time or humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time?” Some 65% of adults say humans have evolved over time and 31% say humans have always existed in their present form. By comparison, fully 98% of AAAS scientists say humans and other living things have evolved over time. Those in the general public who said humans evolved over time were asked a follow-up question about whether natural processes like natural selection guided evolution or whether a supreme being guided evolution. Some 35% of all adults say natural processes occurred and 24% say a supreme being guided evolution. Among the general public, those more likely to say humans have existed in their present form since the beginning include: women, African-Americans, older adults, and those who do not have college degrees. Beliefs about evolution among the general public also vary by religious group with white evangelical Protestants especially likely to say that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning. The Pew Research survey asked: “Which of these three statements about the earth’s temperature comes closest to your view? The earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels, or the earth is getting warmer mostly because of natural patterns in the earth’s environment or there is no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer? When asked to pick among three choices, 50% said that climate change is occurring mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels, 23% said that climate change is mostly because of natural patterns in earth’s environment, and another 25% said there is no solid evidence the earth is getting warmer. That contrasts with views among scientists; fully 87% of AAAS scientists say the earth is warming due to human activity, 9% say the earth is warming due to natural changes in the earth’s environment and just 3% say there is no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer. Seniors (ages 65 and older) are less inclined than other age groups to say that climate change is mostly due to human activity and more among this group say there is no solid evidence of warming. Those with a college degree are more likely than those with less education to say that climate change is occurring due to human activity. Men and women hold similar views on this issue. Hispanics are more inclined than non-Hispanic whites to say the earth is warming due to human activity. Views about climate change tend to differ by party and ideology, a pattern also seen in previous Pew Research surveys. Fully 71% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic say the earth is warming primarily due to human activity. In comparison, only 27% of Republicans and leaning Republicans hold this view; 30% of this group says climate change is mostly due to natural patterns in the earth’s environment and 41% say there is no solid evidence the earth is warming. The Pew Research survey asked a question about the role of astronauts in the future as part of space exploration: “The cost of sending human astronauts to space is considerably greater than the cost of using robotic machines for space exploration. As you think about the future of the U.S. space program, do you think it is essential or not essential to include the use of human astronauts in space?” A majority of the public (59%) says astronauts are essential to include in the future of the U.S. space program, while 39% say astronauts are not essential. By contrast, 52% of AAAS scientists say astronauts are not essential and 47% say they are essential. Men are a bit more likely than women to consider astronauts essential in the future of the U.S. space program. There are no differences in views about this issue by age, race and ethnicity, or education. The survey asked: “Do you think the space station has been a good investment for this country, or don’t you think so?” Some 64% of the public say investment in the space station was a good investment, about three-in-ten (29%) say it was not. Among AAAS scientists, 68% say the space station was a good investment for the country. Those who have attended college or hold a college degree are more likely to say the space station has been a good investment for the country. There are no differences on this question by gender or race and ethnicity. Additional contributions to this material were made by Monica Anderson.","Two - thirds ( 67 % ) of adults say scientists do not have a clear understanding , while 28 % say scientists have a clear understanding of the health effects .

Perhaps equally important, Barack Obama’s political standing is in some respects weaker than it was at a comparable point in the 2010 campaign, which ended with the Republicans gaining a majority in the House. A national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY, conducted April 23-27 among 1,501 adults (including 1,162 registered voters), finds that 47% of registered voters support the Republican candidate in their district or lean Republican, while 43% favor the Democratic candidate or lean Democratic. The trend over the past six months in the so-called generic ballot shows that Democrats have lost ground. In October, Democrats held a six-point lead (49% to 43%) in midterm voting preferences. While a majority of voters (54%) say that Barack Obama will not be a factor in their vote this fall, more (26%) see their vote as a vote against the president than for him (16%). In February 2010, 24% of voters saw their vote as for Obama while about as many (20%) considered it a vote against him. At this early point in the campaign, Obama inspires far less enthusiasm among Democratic voters than he did four years ago. Only three-in-ten Democratic voters (31%) think of their vote as being “for” the president. In February 2010, 47% of Democratic voters saw their vote as an expression of support for the president. Republicans are no more likely to consider their vote as “against” the president than they were in early 2010 (46% today, 42% in February 2010). But Republicans typically vote at higher rates than Democrats in midterm elections. Democratic voters’ lack of enthusiasm for Obama may complicate Democrats’ turnout efforts. The president’s overall job approval rating has shown virtually no change dating back to last December. Currently 44% of the public approve of the job he is doing as president while 50% disapprove In late April 2010, Obama’s job rating was slightly more positive than negative (47% approve, 42% disapprove). Obama’s rating varied little over the remainder of the campaign four years ago. Obama’s current approval measure is much higher than George W. Bush’s at this point in the 2006 midterm, and Obama is less of a drag on his party’s midterm prospects than Bush was. In April 2006, Bush had a 35% job rating and twice as many voters considered their midterm vote as an expression of opposition to the president than as a signal of support (34% to 17%). Yet the public’s desire for a change from the president’s policies is almost as widespread as it was during Bush’s second term. Thinking about the next presidential election, 65% would like to see the next president offer different policies and programs from the Obama administration while 30% want Obama’s successor to offer similar policies. In April 2006, 70% wanted the next president to have policies different from Bush; 23% wanted similar policies. By contrast, in June 1999, at a later point in the Clinton administration, just half wanted the next president to pursue different policies. While Democrats face a number of possible disadvantages in the fall, their party’s congressional leaders continue to be viewed less negatively than GOP leaders. Just 23% of the public approves of the way Republican leaders in Congress are handling their jobs while nearly three times as many (68%) disapprove. Job ratings for Democratic leaders, while hardly robust, are not as bad: 32% approve of their job performance while 60% disapprove. Despite weak job ratings for Republican leaders, the public is divided over whether their economic policies or Obama’s would do more to strengthen the economy over the next few years. About four-in-ten (43%) think Republican leaders’ policies would do more for the economy while about the same share (39%) says Obama’s policies would be more effective. The survey also finds: Economic Pessimism Persists. The survey was conducted before Friday’s jobs report, which showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.3%, its lowest level since 2008, and that the economy had added 288,000 jobs. However, more than 800,000 people left the labor force. From the public’s point of view, jobs remain scarce: 65% say jobs in their community are difficult to find while 27% say there are plenty of jobs available. Since the recession, perceptions of the job market have become less negative as the unemployment rate has declined. However, there has been virtually no change in these views since last June (64% jobs hard to find), although the jobless rate has fallen by more than a percentage point (from 7.5% to 6.3%) since then. Moreover, there has been no increase in economic optimism. About as many say that economic conditions will be worse (24%) as better (25%) a year from now, with 49% predicting little change. Asked to describe the economic recovery, 66% say the economy is recovering but not so strongly, 26% say the economy isn’t recovering at all, while just 6% think the economy is recovering strongly. Views of ACA Little Changed. As other recent national polls have shown, including the April health care tracking survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the recent surge in signups for the new health care exchanges has had little impact on public opinion about the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the share disapproving of the law (55%) is as high as it ever has been in the four-year history of the law. Just 41% approve of the 2010 health care law. When asked about the health care law’s future, 49% of Americans say they think the law’s major provisions are probably “here to stay” while 43% say they probably will be eliminated. As expected, opinions about the law’s fate are linked to underlying views of the ACA. Still, about a quarter of the law’s supporters (27%) say its major provisions may be eliminated, while 67% say they are probably “here to stay.” Conversely, a third of ACA opponents (36%) say key aspects of the law will likely remain in place; 55% expect them to be eliminated.","When asked about the health care law ’s future , 49 % of Americans say they think the law ’s major provisions are probably “ here to stay ” while 43 % say they probably will be eliminated .

","While it remains to be seen whether President Donald Trump will act on campaign promises to get tough on Beijing, the American public has largely soured on China in recent years. In a January survey by Pew Research Center, 65% said China is either an adversary (22%) or a serious problem (43%), while only about a third (31%) said China is not a problem. And in a separate spring 2016 survey, a majority (55%) of Americans held an unfavorable opinion of their largest Asian rival. In the United States, negative views of China increased by 26 percentage points between 2006 and 2016. And American negativity toward China has been higher than Chinese negativity toward the U.S. in every year since 2014. By comparison, Chinese unfavorable views of the U.S. remained below 50% for most of Barack Obama’s presidency. In both countries, those ages 50 and older are more likely than those 18 to 34 to view the other nation unfavorably. But even among young Americans (as among all other age groups in the U.S.), negative views of China increased over time, rising 21 percentage points between 2006 and 2016. However, Chinese youth warmed to the U.S. over the same time period, with unfavorable views falling 12 points. In the U.S., Republicans have consistently had more unfavorable views of China than Democrats. In the 2016 survey, for example, 63% of Republicans held an unfavorable view of China, compared with 54% of Democrats. But over the past decade, unfavorable sentiment has increased among supporters of both parties by more than 20 percentage points. As Americans have become more negative on China, they have also become more downbeat about their country’s global stature. In 2016, a 46% plurality of Americans said the U.S. plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader compared with 10 years ago. This figure was up 26 percentage points from 2004, when just 20% believed American power was waning. The Chinese public, on the other hand, sees its country’s influence on the rise. Three-quarters of Chinese believe their country is playing a more important role in the world today compared with a decade ago. And when it comes to the global balance of power, two-thirds of Chinese said in 2015 that their nation would eventually replace the U.S. – or had already replaced it – as the world’s leading superpower. Americans, on the other hand, were split. About half (48%) believed China would never surpass the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower, while 46% said that China would eventually replace the U.S. or already had.

From January to November 2014, 171 stations changed hands, at cost of about $5 billion, according to consulting firm BIA/Kelsey. This follows a wave of consolidations that took place in 2013, when about 300 local TV stations were purchased, at a total value of more than $8 billion. This leaves 589 stations in the hands of just 12 companies – up from 304 a decade ago. Ten of the 12 companies reported revenue growth through the third quarter of 2014 (January – September) compared with the same period a year earlier (21st Century Fox and Meredith operate on a fiscal year that ends June 30, therefore the revenues reported here for those two companies are for July 1 through  September 30, 2014). Media General sits at the top, with $458 million in revenue for the nine months ending in September 30, 2014, an 187% growth from the previous year. During this accounting period, Media General owned 32 local TV stations in 29 markets, including 13 that it acquired in a merger with Young Broadcasting in November 2013. In March 2014, Media General announced plans to expand further by purchasing LIN Media. The merger was completed in December  2014, bringing the Media General total to 71 stations in 48 markets. Gannett ranks second in revenue growth for this time period with a 97% increase across its 46 stations. Only CBS and 21st Century Fox, which own 30 and 28 stations respectively saw their broadcast revenue flatten compared to the same period in the previous year. CBS said the previous year’s revenue had been boosted by its Super Bowl broadcast but it also reported “softness in the advertising marketplace.” 21st Century Fox attributed its flat revenue to lower entertainment prime time ratings. One factor that has driven the interest of media companies in making big investments in local television is political ad spending, which after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling seems to guarantee windfalls to local TV stations in even-numbered years. In the third quarter, local TV station groups saw positive results tied to an influx of political advertising dollars. From January to mid-October 2014, total political ad spending for local TV was about $1.3 billion, according to a Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) analysis of Kantar CMAG data. Seven of the 12 companies report political advertising revenue separately from other types of revenue.  For this group, political advertising in 2014 was more than eight times higher than the year before and the share of political advertising out of the total revenues rose to 8% in 2014 compared to just 1% in 2013. Media General enjoyed the strongest boost in the group, with an increase of more than 1,400%. Still, LIN Media’s political advertising revenues, which saw the smallest growth, were up 360%. Moreover, the group’s political advertising revenues rose 77% since the last midterm elections in 2010.","Ten of the 12 companies reported revenue growth through the third quarter of 2014 ( January – September ) compared with the same period a year earlier ( 21st Century Fox and Meredith operate on a fiscal year that ends June 30 , therefore the revenues reported here for those two companies are for July 1 through September 30 , 2014 ) .

A majority of Americans support the idea of using gene editing with the goal of delivering direct health benefits for babies, but at the same time, a majority considers the use of such techniques to boost a baby’s intelligence something that takes technology “too far.” About seven-in-ten Americans (72%) say that changing an unborn baby’s genetic characteristics to treat a serious disease or condition that the baby would have at birth is an appropriate use of medical technology, while 27% say this would be taking technology too far. A somewhat smaller share of Americans say gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of developing a serious disease or condition over their lifetime is appropriate (60% say this, while 38% say it would be taking medical technology too far). But just 19% of Americans say it would be appropriate to use gene editing to make a baby more intelligent; eight-in-ten (80%) say this would be taking medical technology too far. These are some of the findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted April 23-May 6, 2018, among 2,537 U.S. adults. While public discussions about potentially altering a baby’s genetic makeup have been ongoing for decades, the development of a new gene-splicing technology – known as CRISPR – has accelerated the debate and brought new urgency to better understanding public opinion about gene editing as well as the broader social, ethical and policy implications ahead.1 Previous Pew Research Center surveys have tracked public opinion about gene editing using different question wording and, in some cases, different polling methodologies. As such, those findings are not directly comparable to this new survey. However, the broad pattern – that public support for gene editing varies with its intended purpose – is consistent with a 2016 study that explored public views about the possibility of using gene editing to “enhance” a baby’s health over the course of their lifetime and a 2014 survey.2 Regardless of the intended purpose of gene editing, experts acknowledge that further development of these techniques will likely involve testing in human embryos. In August 2017, research scientists in the United States reported the first successful use of gene editing in human embryos to eliminate an inherited condition. When asked to consider the possibility that the development of gene editing would involve testing on human embryos, one third of Americans (33%) say this would be appropriate while about two-thirds (65%) say this would be taking medical technology too far. The 2016 Pew Research Center survey using different question wording found that most adults said testing on human embryos to develop gene editing would make gene editing less acceptable for them. Several patterns emerge in public opinion about gene editing in these varying contexts. There are large differences in acceptance of gene editing between the highly religious and less religious. In addition, there is a gender gap in views about gene editing, with women less accepting of it than men. People with higher levels of science knowledge and greater familiarity with gene editing also tend to be more accepting of it. Americans who are high in religious commitment – that is, those who attend religious services at least weekly, pray at least daily and say that religion is very important in their lives – are less inclined than those with either medium or low levels of religious commitment to say that gene editing is an appropriate use of medical technology.3 For example, those high in religious commitment are closely divided over whether it is appropriate to use gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of disease later in life; 46% say this is appropriate, while 53% consider it taking technology too far. In contrast, roughly three-quarters of those low in religious commitment (73%) say gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of developing a serious disease or condition is an appropriate use of medical technology. And, while a 57% majority of those high in religious commitment say gene editing to treat a congenital disorder in a baby is an appropriate use of medical technology, a much larger share of those with low religious commitment (82%) say this is appropriate. Those with high levels of religiosity also stand out when considering the possibility that development of gene editing would entail testing on human embryos. An overwhelming majority of those high in religious commitment (87%) say this would be taking medical technology too far; just 11% of this group says this would be appropriate. In contrast, 55% of those low in religious commitment say that development of gene editing techniques that require testing on human embryos would be an appropriate use of medical technology. The differences by religiosity in views on the appropriateness of gene editing tend to persist even when statistically controlling for other factors such as gender, race and ethnicity, age, and education that are related to religious beliefs and practices. See Appendix for details. There are also differences in views about gene editing by religious affiliation, particularly if such techniques would involve embryonic testing. Just 11% of white evangelical Protestants say that if development of gene editing techniques required testing on human embryos, it would be an appropriate use of medical technology. By contrast, about half of the religiously unaffiliated (52%), including 79% of atheists and 57% of agnostics, say that embryonic testing to develop gene editing techniques would be an appropriate use of medical technology. See the Appendix for other views about gene editing by religious affiliation. Men are more inclined than women to view gene editing as an appropriate use of medical technology, regardless of its intent. About two-thirds of men (65%) believe that gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of developing a serious disease later in life is an appropriate use of medical technology, compared with 54% of women. And men (76%) are more supportive than women (68%) of using gene editing to treat a congenital disorder. Similarly, more men (43%) than women (24%) are accepting of gene editing technology if it required embryonic testing to develop. Women tend to have higher levels of religious commitment, on average, but differences by gender tend to hold even when controlling for religiosity and other factors in statistical models. See the Appendix for details. Previous Pew Research Center surveys in 2016 and 2014, while not directly comparable due to different polling methods and question wording, have also found that women tend to be less accepting than men when it comes to gene editing for babies. People high in science knowledge – based on a nine-item index – tend to be more accepting of using gene editing for babies.4 Some 86% of those with high science knowledge believe it is appropriate to use gene editing to treat a congenital disorder, compared with 58% of those with low science knowledge. And, 71% of those with high science knowledge say it is appropriate to use gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of disease that would occur later in life, compared with 49% of those with low science knowledge.5 However, few Americans say it is appropriate to use gene editing to make a baby more intelligent, regardless of their level of science knowledge. Judgments on the appropriateness of gene editing also follow a similar pattern by education level, which is closely linked with science knowledge. Those with a postgraduate degree are more accepting of gene editing for treating or reducing the risk of a disease than those with a high school degree or less. People who say they have heard at least a little about gene editing that can be used to change a baby’s genetic characteristics are more likely than those who have heard nothing at all to say gene editing would be appropriate in each of the circumstances considered in this survey. A Pew Research Center survey in 2016 found a similar tendency for those who report familiarity with gene editing to express more interest in and acceptance of using these technologies to enhance a baby’s health over the course of their lifetime. Although gene editing for babies is still in development, a separate April 2018 survey found that about half of Americans (52%) believe it is likely that within the next 50 years, we will be able to eliminate almost all birth defects by manipulating the genes of an embryo before a baby is born. In the current survey, as people think about a future with possible widespread use of gene editing to change a baby’s genetic makeup, more anticipate negative than positive effects on society. Specifically, a majority of Americans (58%) believe gene editing will very likely lead to increased inequality because it will only be available to the wealthy. Some 54% of Americans anticipate a slippery slope, saying it’s very likely that “even if gene editing is used appropriately in some cases, others will use these techniques in ways that are morally unacceptable.” And, 46% expect it is very likely that gene editing techniques will be used before we fully understand how they affect people’s health. Far smaller shares see positive outcomes as very likely if gene editing for babies were to become widely available. Roughly two-in-ten Americans (18%) say it is very likely that development of these techniques will pave the way for new medical advances that benefit society as a whole. Another 42% say this is fairly likely to occur, while 38% consider this not too or not at all likely. Just 16% see the widespread use of gene editing as very likely to help people live longer and better quality lives. About half (48%) say this is fairly likely, while 34% say this outcome is not too or not at all likely. Women are more inclined than men to expect negative effects if gene editing becomes widely available, in keeping with gender differences over acceptance of gene editing. For example, larger shares of women than men say this technology will lead to an increase in inequality as it will only be available for the wealthy (63% say this is very likely vs. 52% of men) or say it will be used in morally unacceptable ways (57% vs. 51%). And although only minorities of men and women see positive effects as very likely, men are somewhat more inclined to anticipate positive outcomes. Expectations also vary by self-reported familiarity with gene editing. Those who have heard a lot about gene editing to change a baby’s genetic characteristics are more inclined to anticipate positive outcomes from its widespread use. Some 36% of this group thinks it is very likely that the widespread availability of gene editing would pave the way for new medical advances that are beneficial to society, compared with about half as many of those who have heard a little or nothing about gene editing (16%). However, those most familiar with gene editing are more likely than those with no familiarity to also anticipate downsides. About two-thirds of those who have heard a lot about gene editing (64%) say it is very likely that widespread availability of gene editing will increase inequality because the technology will primarily be available only for the wealthy, compared with 53% of those who have heard nothing about using gene editing to change a baby’s genetic characteristics. And, 65% of those who have heard a lot about gene editing think it’s very likely that others will use these techniques in morally unacceptable ways, while 54% of those who have heard a little and 52% of those who have heard nothing about gene editing say this. A similar pattern occurs with levels of science knowledge. A larger share of people with high science knowledge anticipate positive outcomes from the widespread availability of gene editing than those with low science knowledge. At the same time, those with high science knowledge are at least equally likely as those with low science knowledge to think negative effects from the widespread availability of gene editing are very likely. The American public also tends to be skeptical about whether medical experts fully comprehend the health consequences of gene editing. A 36% minority of Americans believe that medical researchers understand the health effects of gene editing for babies either very (7%) or fairly well (29%), while 62% say medical researchers do not understand the health effects at all or not too well. Familiarity with gene editing is linked with beliefs about medical researchers’ understanding of it. About half of those who have heard a lot about gene editing for babies (51%) say that medical researchers understand the health effects of gene editing for babies at least fairly well, compared with three-in-ten of those who have heard nothing at all (30%). However, level of science knowledge based on a nine-item index is not related to views on this issue; 36% of those with high science knowledge and 40% of those with low science knowledge believe that medical researchers understand the health effects of changing a baby’s genetic characteristics at least fairly well. There are no or only modest differences on this question by gender or religious commitment.","Expectations also vary by self - reported familiarity with gene editing .

(%)","As 2014 draws to a close, the public is deeply pessimistic about the prospects for healing the nation’s deep political divisions. And most Americans think continued partisan gridlock would wreak significant damage on the country. To start, perceptions of the current level of political division continue at record levels: 81% say the country is more politically divided these days than in the past. While that is little changed from two years ago, it is as high a percentage expressing this view as at any point over the past decade. Looking ahead, few Americans expect the nation’s political differences to diminish. Just 17% think the country will be less politically divided five years from now. More than three-quarters (78%) say either the country will be as about divided as is today (41%), or more politically divided (36%). A skeptical public does not expect much cooperation from either Barack Obama or Republicans in Congress over the next two years: 44% expect Barack Obama to cooperate with GOP leaders either a great deal or fair amount. Even fewer (28%) expect Congressional Republicans to cooperate with Obama. A November Pew Research Center survey found that this may be just fine with some partisans, many of whom expressed a desire for their side to stand up to their political opponents on issues, rather than work together and accept some concessions. After Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, 48% said Democratic leaders would cooperate at least a fair amount with former President George W. Bush – 20 points higher than the share saying that about Republicans today. And 52% expected Bush to cooperate with the Democrats. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY, conducted Dec. 3-7 among 1,507 adults, finds that the costs and consequences of partisan gridlock are hitting home for many Americans. Fully 71% say a failure of Republicans and Democrats to work together over the next two years would hurt the nation “a lot” and 16% say it will hurt “some.” While the negative impact of political gridlock is seen as being most acute for the country as a whole, 45% say they would be hurt a lot personally by an absence of partisan cooperation, and 28% would be hurt some. Notably, there are only minimal partisan differences in these opinions. The public’s unhappiness with Washington also is reflected in their views of the most important problems facing the nation. Despite signs of an improving economy, about a third (34%) cite an economic issue as the top national problem. But just half as many specifically cite unemployment or joblessness as did so at the start of the year (20% then, 10% now). Meanwhile, the share expressing dissatisfaction with government or the president, or who cite partisan gridlock or the divisions in the country has increased from 13% last January to 18% currently. Irrespective of the top issue they see facing the nation, few expect Obama and GOP leaders to make progress on that problem. About three-quarters (76%) of those who cited a top national problem – including large majorities of Republicans (78%), Democrats (71%) and independents (80%), say they do not think Obama and Republican leaders will make progress on the problem they mentioned. The survey finds there has been virtually no change in Obama’s job ratings over the past year. Currently, 42% approve of the way he is handling his job as president, while 51% disapprove. Obama’s job ratings have not varied by more than two points since January. Obama’s job rating for handling the economy has risen six points – from 39% to 45% – since August. At the same time, the 45% who approve of the way he is handling the threat of terrorism is the lowest mark of his presidency on this issue. Weeks before the start of the new Congress, the public takes a dim view of Congress and both political parties. Just 22% express a favorable opinion of Congress; positive views of Congress have remained below 30% for more than three years. There is no sign of a honeymoon for the Republican Party following its midterm victories: Just 37% view the GOP favorably while 57% view it unfavorably, little changed over the past year. What has changed is the Democratic Party’s favorable ratings, which are now nearly as low as the GOP’s. Just 41% have a favorable impression of the Democratic Party while 54% have an unfavorable opinion. That is among the most negative measures of favorability for the Democrats in more than two decades of polling. The public remains deeply dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country. Just 26% are satisfied with national conditions, while 71% are dissatisfied. And it has muted expectations for the year to come: 49% say they think 2015 will be a better year than 2014, while 42% think it will be worse. The current ratings are more pessimistic than in recent years, as the public generally takes an optimistic view of the year to come. A year ago, 56% thought 2014 would be a better year than the last, compared with fewer (35%) who thought it would be worse. The current seven-point gap in expectations for a better (49%) than worse (42%) year is the narrowest margin measured in Pew Research Center surveys dating to 1994. The more negative expectations for 2015 are driven in large part by a shift in views among Democrats. A month after the Republican Party gained full control of Congress, 60% of Democrats expect 2015 to be better than 2014. That is down 21 points from a year ago when 81% thought 2014 would be better than 2013. Nonetheless, views among Democrats are brighter than those of Republicans: just 34% of Republicans expect the coming year to be better than the last, little changed from prospective views of 2014 (33% better). In December 2012, following Barack Obama’s reelection, just 22% of Republicans thought 2013 would be a better year than 2012. Across age groups, young adults under age 30 are less optimistic about 2015 than they were about 2014. Overall, 54% think 2015 will be better than 2014, compared with two-thirds (67%) who thought 2014 would be better than 2013. Those under 30 are often the most optimistic age group about the coming year. However, in the current survey they are no more likely to say 2015 will be better than 2014 than are those ages 30-49 (56%). The public’s expectations for cooperation between leaders in Washington are highly partisan. Fully 66% of Democrats think Obama will cooperate at least a fair amount with Republican leaders in Congress over the next two years, compared with just 19% of Republicans who say this. When it comes to Republicans leaders in Congress, Democrats are skeptical that they will cooperate with Obama: just 18% say they expect this to happen. Republicans don’t expect their party’s congressional leaders to cooperate with Obama either: Just 37% say this compared with 62% who expect them to cooperate not much or not at all with the president. In part, low expectations for GOP cooperation among rank-and-file Republicans may reflect the fact that 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want their leaders to stand up to Obama on issues, even if less gets done, rather than work with him, if it means disappointing some groups of Republican supporters. (For more see: “Little Enthusiasm, Familiar Divisions After the GOP’s Big Midterm Victory,” released Nov. 12, 2014). Expectations for compromise between the GOP-led Congress and Obama are lower than they were eight years ago, following the Democratic Party winning control of Congress during George W. Bush’s second term. In November 2006, about half of the public (48%) expected Democratic leaders to cooperate with Bush, including 59% of Democrats. Today, just 28% expect cooperation from Republican leaders, driven in part by relatively low expectations for compromise among Republicans (37%). Eight years ago, 52% expected Bush to cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress over the final two years of his presidency, slightly more than the 44% who expect Obama to cooperate with GOP leaders today. In the current survey, Republicans (19%) are much more skeptical about Obama cooperating with GOP leaders than Democrats (37%) were about Bush cooperating with Democratic leaders in November of 2006. The share of Americans citing economic issues as the most important problem facing the nation has declined significantly over the course of 2014. In the current survey, 34% say economic issues are the country’s top problem, down from 48% in January of this year. And as the national unemployment rate has moved lower, the percentage specifically mentioning ‘unemployment’ as the most important problem facing the nation has declined ten points from 20% to 10%. Nonetheless, more continue to cite economic issues as the biggest problem facing the country than any other set of issues. Overall, 18% mention dissatisfaction with government, Obama, partisanship or gridlock as the country’s top problem, up slightly from 13% earlier this year. Despite the emergence of the terrorist group known as ISIS – and the U.S.-led military campaign against the group – just 9% say foreign or international issues are the country’s top problem, unchanged from January. Today, 42% say they approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president, while 51% disapprove. These ratings are little changed over the past year. Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans (89%) disapprove of Obama’s performance, while views among independents are also more negative than positive (55% disapprove, 39% approve). Obama continues to receive positive ratings from a majority of Democrats (72% approve, 19% disapprove). Obama’s handling of the economy is currently one of his better ratings: 45% currently approve, up six points (from 39%) in August. While as many (45%) approve of Obama’s handling of the threat of terrorism, this is his lowest ever rating on this issue: As recently as June 2013 a majority of Americans (56%) approved of his handling of terrorist threats. Tax policy (34% approve) and foreign policy (37%) are among Obama’s worst-performing issues. And while just 38% approve of Obama’s handling of immigration policy, this reflects an improvement from August of this year when just 31% approved of his handling of immigration (See the separate report on immigration policy released today for more details.) Following the Democratic Party’s losses in the 2014 elections, views of the Democratic Party have taken a hit: Just 41% of Americans have a favorable impression of the party, down from 47% in October—and among the lowest ratings ever for the Democrats. Though views of the Democratic Party have grown more negative, there is no sign that views of the GOP have improved: Only 37% say they have a favorable view of the Republican Party, a rating that is unchanged over the course of the last year. Though about three-quarters of both Democrats (76%) and Republicans (78%) view their own party favorably, Democratic ratings of their own party have become less positive in the last few months (in October, 85% of Democrats had a favorable view of their own party). And today independents’ views of the two parties are about the same. About a third have favorable impressions of either the Republican Party (32%) or the Democratic Party (33%); in October, more independents viewed the Democratic Party (41%) positively than the Republican Party (33%). As has been the case for the last several years, Americans view Congress negatively: Just 22% now express a favorable opinion of the institution while 71% say their opinion is unfavorable. The current ratings rival the lowest on record (in July 2013, 21% had a favorable opinion, 70% an unfavorable one); and are down six points since July of this year, though they are on-par with ratings in February. Though negative ratings of Congress cross party lines, Democratic impressions have become more negative over the last several months; today 21% of Democrats view Congress favorably, down from 30% in July. And as Republicans are poised to take control of both houses of Congress in January, their views of the institution are little changed over the past few years; currently 27% say they have a favorable view. Independents’ views of Congress remain deeply negative; just 20% have a positive impression of Congress. Public views of congressional leaders—on both sides of the aisle—continue to be more negative than positive. By wide margins, more have unfavorable than favorable impressions of House Speaker John Boehner (46% unfavorable, 24% favorable), incoming Senate majority (and current minority) leader Mitch McConnell (37% vs. 21%), House minority leader Nancy Pelosi (47% vs. 27%) and outgoing Senate majority leader Harry Reid (41% vs. 20%). Overall, these ratings are little changed from before the midterm election. However, favorable views of Harry Reid in the wake Democrats losing control of the Senate are lower than they were in October 2013. At that time, 27% had a favorable opinion of him, while 39% viewed him unfavorably. In particular, views of Reid have become more negative among Democrats. Nearly half of Democrats (47%) had a positive impression of him in October 2013, while just 18% viewed him unfavorably; today, Democratic opinions of Reid are about evenly divided (28% favorable, 26% unfavorable). The three other leaders continue to be viewed more positively than negatively by those in their own party, while opinions of those in the opposing party are largely negative. Members of the congressional leadership are not well-known by the public. In particular, as Mitch McConnell prepares to become majority leader of the Senate, fully 42% of Americans do not know enough about him to rate him (including 24% who have never heard of the Kentucky senator). Notably, Nancy Pelosi continues to be a more visible figure than the other leaders – just 26% fail to offer an opinion of Pelosi. Overall, nearly half of Americans (48%) have a favorable view of Barack Obama, while about as many (49%) say their opinion of the president is unfavorable. The first lady’s public image is more positive: 61% have a favorable opinion of Michelle Obama, while just 31% say their opinion is unfavorable. Public views of both the president and first lady are little changed since July.","The public remains deeply dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country .

Majorities say that large banks, large corporations and the wealthy have been helped a great deal or a fair amount by government policies. By contrast, 72% say that, in general, the government’s policies since the recession have done little or nothing to help middle class people, and nearly as many say they have provided little or no help for small businesses (68%) and the poor (65%). These opinions have changed little in recent years, and differ only modestly across demographic and income categories. There are significant partisan differences in these views, though majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents say that government policies following the start of the recession have done little or nothing for the poor and the middle class. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 18-22 among 1,504 adults, finds that opinions about whether various aspects of the economy – jobs, household incomes and the stock market – have recovered from the recession are much more positive than they were two years ago. Fully 67% say the job situation has recovered at least somewhat from the recession, which is up 20 points from September 2013. However, most (60%) see only a partial recovery in jobs: Just 7% think that the job situation has fully recovered from the recession. And nearly a third (32%) thinks the job situation “has hardly recovered at all.” Similarly, more think household incomes have recovered than did so two years ago. But while 51% say there has been a partial recovery in incomes (up from 42% in September 2013), just 4% say they have fully recovered. About four-in-ten 42% think household incomes have hardly come back from the recession. There has been less change since 2013 in views about recovery in the stock market and real estate. In 2013, majorities said both sectors had either fully or partially recovered, and that remains the case today. But there has been a 10-point increase since then in the share saying the stock market has “fully” recovered from the recession (31% now, 21% then). When asked about the impact of the recession on their personal finances, 29% say the recession had a major impact on their finances and their finances have mostly recovered; about as many (30%) say it had a major impact and their finances have not recovered. Four-in-ten say the recession did not have a major effect on their finances. The share saying their finances have not recovered from the recession has declined slightly, from 36% in 2011 and 33% in 2013 to 30% currently. Those with lower family incomes are especially likely to say they are still recovering from the recession, six years after it ended. Among those with family incomes of less than $30,000, 24% say the recession had a major impact and their finances have mostly recovered, while many more (38%) say it had a major impact but they have yet to recover. Just 36% say the recession did not have a major effect on them. By contrast, people with family incomes of $100,000 or more were less affected by the recession; half (50%) say the recession did not have a major impact on their finances, the highest percentage of any income category. And among those affected by the recession, far more say their finances have mostly recovered (36%) than say they have not yet recovered (14%). Economic System Still Seen at Risk. Most Americans continue to think the U.S. economic system is still vulnerable to the type of crisis that devastated the economy in the fall of 2008. Currently, 63% say the economic system is no more secure today than it was before the 2008 financial crisis, while only about a third of Americans (34%) say it is more secure. These attitudes are virtually unchanged from two years ago. Views of National Economy Weaken a Bit. About a quarter (26%) view economic conditions as excellent or good, about the same as in January (27%). But “poor” ratings of the economy, which fell nine points from October to January, have increased seven points since last month. Most Say Economic System Favors Powerful Interests. Currently, 62% say the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests, while only about half as many (33%) think the system is fair to most Americans. This opinion is little changed since last year. The view that the economic system is tilted toward the powerful is shared by those in all income categories. Stark Partisan Divide over Government Aid to Poor. About half of the public (49%) says government aid to the poor does more good than harm, because people are unable to escape poverty until basic needs are met. Nearly as many (44%) say government aid to the poor does more harm than good, by making people dependent on the government. There is a stark partisan divide in these attitudes: 74% of Democrats say government assistance to the poor, on balance, does more good than harm; 71% of Republicans say it does more harm than good. Majorities across virtually all demographic and partisan groups say wealthy people have been helped a great deal or a fair amount by government policies since the recession began. Substantially smaller shares say middle class people and poor people have benefitted at least a fair amount. Still, there are partisan differences in these opinions: Republicans (55%) are less likely than Democrats (73%) to say the wealthy have benefitted at least a fair amount from government policies since the start of the recession. Republicans also are less likely to say that the middle class has been helped: Just 16% say the middle class have been helped at least a fair amount, compared with 36% of Democrats. Comparable shares of Republicans (38%) and Democrats (34%) say poor people have been helped a great deal or fair amount by government policies. Majorities of those in all income groups say that government policies implemented since the start of the recession have helped the wealthy. At the same time, relatively small percentages across income levels say government policies have done at least a fair amount for either the poor or middle class. There is broad agreement among demographic and partisan groups that government policies since the start of the recession have helped large banks and financial institutions at least a fair amount. Fully 72% express this view, including 45% who say government policies have helped large banks and financial institutions a “great deal.” Two-thirds (67%) say the government’s policies have benefitted large corporations. These views also vary only modestly across different income and partisan groups. There are larger partisan differences in views of what government policies have done to help small businesses since the beginning of the recession. About three times as many Democrats (43%) as Republicans (14%) say these policies have helped small businesses at least a fair amount. Since September 2013, there has been an across-the-board rise in the view that the job situation has at least partially recovered from the recession. However, most say that jobs have partially (60%), rather than fully (7%), recovered. Republicans, Democrats and independents, and those across income levels, are all much more likely to see a stronger recovery in the job situation than in September 2013. Still, far more Democrats (80%) than Republicans (54%) see a recovery in jobs. A similar pattern is evident in whether household incomes have recovered since the start of the recession. And there continues to be a sizable gap in these perceptions both by family income and partisanship. Half (50%) of those with incomes of $30,000 or less say that household incomes have recovered fully or partially, while nearly as many (48%) say they have recovered “hardly at all.” Majorities in higher income groups see at least a partial recovery in household incomes. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats (65%) say household incomes have seen some recovery from the recession, compared with only about half of Republicans (52%) and independents (50%). Overall, 26% describe economic conditions in the country as excellent or good, while slightly more (31%) say they are poor; a 43% plurality say conditions are only fair. Positive views of the economy are about the same as in January (27%). But somewhat more describe the economy as poor than did so last month (31% now, 24% then) while the share saying it is only fair has ticked down (from 48% to 43%). Nonetheless, views of the economy remain much more positive than they were in January 2014, when just 16% rated the economy as excellent or good. Looking ahead, 27% say they expect economic conditions to be better in a year compared with 20% who think they will be worse; 52% say they will be about the same as they are now. The share saying they expect conditions to improve has declined slightly from January (from 31% to 27%). There continue to be partisan divides in views of economic conditions. Among Democrats, 36% rate conditions as excellent or good compared with just 14% of Republicans. Democrats also are more optimistic about the future: 37% say the economy will be better in a year, while just 9% think it will be worse. Among Republicans, more think economic conditions will be worse in a year (28%) than better (15%). Most Americans (62%) think “the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests.” Only about half as many (33%) say the system is “generally fair to most Americans.” Seven-in-ten Democrats (70%) and 65% of independents regard the economic system as unfair. Republicans are divided: 49% say the system unfairly favors powerful interests, while 47% say it is fair to most Americans. Majorities across income categories view the system as unfair. Most Americans say it is still possible to get ahead, despite the perceived unfairness of the economic system. Nearly two-thirds (64%) say “most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard.” A third (33%) says that “hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people.” As with opinions about the fairness of the economic system, views about whether hard work can lead to success differ more along partisan than income lines. Overall, 55% of Democrats say most people can get ahead through hard work compared with larger majorities of independents (63%) and Republicans (78%). Across income levels, similarly large majorities say most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard. Opinions on the impact of government assistance to the poor are even more partisan than views on the fairness of the economic system and hard work and achievement. Overall, the public is split with 44% saying government aid to the poor “does more harm than good by making people too dependent on government assistance,” while about as many (49%) say it does “more good than harm because people can’t get out of poverty until their basic needs are met.” Republicans, by 71% to 24%, say government aid to the poor does more harm than good. Democrats take the opposite view and by a nearly identical margin (74% to 21%), say aid to the poor does more good than harm. A majority of those with family incomes of less than $30,000 a year (58%) say government aid to the poor does more good than harm. People in higher income groups are more divided. Views on these three questions are largely unchanged from last June. As the Pew Research Center’s Political Typology report noted, there are deep divisions between, as well as within, the broader party coalitions on several of these measures. Within both parties, there are notable divisions by income level in core economic beliefs. Among Democrats, those with family incomes of $75,000 or more are more likely than those with low incomes (less than $30,000) to say the economic system is unfair, that hard work is no guarantee of success and that government aid to the poor does more good than harm. On the value of hard work, for instance, 62% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents with incomes of less than $30,000 say most people can get ahead if they work hard; 57% of those with incomes of $30,000-$74,999 agree. But those with incomes of $75,000 or more are divided: 48% say hard work leads to success, while 51% say it is no guarantee of success for most people. Ideology is a factor in these opinions. For example, 57% of liberal Democrats say hard work is no guarantee of success for most people. By contrast, among conservative and moderate Democrats, 64% say most people who work hard can get ahead. Democrats with higher incomes are more likely to describe their political views as liberal than are those with middle or lower incomes. Among Republicans, by far the biggest differences between income groups are over aid to the poor: 80% of Republicans and Republican leaners with incomes of $75,000 or more say government aid to the poor does more harm than good, as do 71% of those with incomes of $30,000-$74,999. But among Republicans with incomes of less than $30,000, 45% see government assistance to the poor in negative terms, while 48% say it does more good than harm. Majorities of Republicans across income groups say most people can get ahead with hard work. Republicans with incomes of $30,000-$74,999 are somewhat more likely than those with higher or lower incomes to say that the economic system is unfair. Amid debate over which policies would do the most to improve the lives of the middle class, large percentages of Americans identify with the term – either completely or with some qualification. When asked to choose from five names for the social classes, 47% say they are middle class, 29% say they are lower-middle class, while 11% say they are upper-middle class. Just 1% say they belong in the upper class. Somewhat more (10%) place themselves at the bottom of the scale and say they are lower class. Views on this question have changed little over the past year. In January 2014, 44% described themselves as middle class, 28% as lower-middle class and 13% as upper-middle class. Those with family incomes of $100,000 a year or more are among the most likely to place themselves at the top of the social class ladder: 40% say they are either upper-middle or upper class. However, 51% say they belong in the middle class and 8% say they are lower-middle class. Among those with incomes of $75,000-$99,999 and $50,000-$74,999, majorities describe themselves as middle class. Those with smaller incomes are more likely to say they are lower-middle class or lower class. Those with a post-graduate (28%) or college (22%) degree are more likely than those with some college experience (7%) or no college experience (8%) to say they are either upper-middle or upper class. Nonetheless, just 3% of post-graduates describe themselves as “upper class.” There also are racial and ethnic differences in how people describe their social class; about half of blacks (51%) and Hispanics (48%) say they are either lower-middle class or lower class, compared with 35% of whites.","Opinions on the impact of government assistance to the poor are even more partisan than views on the fairness of the economic system and hard work and achievement .

Most say they are better off financially than they were five years ago, and with near unanimity they believe they enjoy a higher standard of living than their parents did. However, they also believe their country is facing a variety of challenges. In particular, corruption – which has been a major focus of President Xi Jinping – remains a serious concern. \t\tFully 84% say corrupt officials are a big problem, and 44% think they are a very big problem.  \t\t But people are optimistic that this problem can be dealt with – 63% say the corruption problem will get better in five years. Meanwhile, there are signs that China’s remarkable economic expansion has had some negative side effects. For instance, many Chinese are concerned about air and water pollution, as well as widening inequality. And serious concerns about food safety have nearly tripled since 2008. People express mixed reactions to the rapid changes China has experienced. \t\tMost say they like the pace of modern life, but they also believe that their traditional way of life is getting lost and that it needs to be protected against foreign influence.  \t\t And a growing number see consumerism and commercialism as a threat to their culture. These are among the key findings from a Pew Research Center survey in China, which is based on face-to-face interviews conducted from April 15 to May 27, 2015, among a nationally representative sample of 3,649 randomly selected adults.1 Among the 15 issues included in this survey, nine are considered either a very big or moderately big problem by at least 70% of the Chinese public. However, no issue tested is rated as a very big problem by half or more of the population. Concerns over corrupt officials top the list, with 44% of Chinese saying this is a very big problem. Still, this is down 10 percentage points from 2014, when 54% cited corrupt officials as a top concern. About\t\t a third of Chinese are worried about environmental damage, with 35% saying air pollution is a very big problem and 34% saying the same about water pollution.  \t\t Three-in-ten or more cite the gap between the rich and poor, safety of food and rising prices as top concerns. Only about two-in-ten cite corrupt businesspeople, education, unemployment, traffic and working conditions as very big problems for China. Concerns\t\t about food safety have risen over the past seven years amid several high-profile scares.  \t\t In 2008, baby formula tainted with melamine was linked to the deaths of six infants and affected almost 300,000 babies. More recently, nearly a half-billion dollars’ worth of meat was seized by authorities in June 2015, some of it having been frozen in the 1970s. Roughly a third (32%) now say food safety is a very big problem, up 20 percentage points from 12% in 2008. While the safety of medicine and the quality of manufactured goods are cited as a top worry by fewer than three-in-ten Chinese, concerns have risen by 19 points and 15 points, respectively, since 2008. On the other hand, concerns about inflation have eased substantially. In 2008, when inflation stood at 5.9%, about seven-in-ten Chinese (72%) were very concerned about rising prices. With a more manageable 1.4% inflation rate projected for 2015, only 30% cite rising prices as a top concern, a decline of a staggering 42 percentage points over seven years. When asked whether a series of top problems will get better, get worse or stay the same in the next five years, the Chinese public offers mixed views. \t\tMore than six-in-ten (63%) believe corruption problems will improve in the next five years.  \t\t A plurality (43%) is also optimistic that progress will be made in food safety. However, the public is split on water pollution: 37% believe it will get better over the next five years, while 34% believe it will get worse. Similar divides are found on air pollution (36% better, 34% worse) and the gap between the rich and poor (35% better, 31% worse). In China’s two largest cities, pessimism about air quality is widespread. More than half of those living in Beijing and Shanghai (53%) say air pollution will get worse in the next five years, compared with roughly a third (34%) of those living elsewhere in China. A recent study linked air pollution to 1.6 million deaths a year in China, with some of the most concentrated sources of pollution found in the northeast corridor that extends from Shanghai to Beijing. On the issue of corruption, optimism about improvement varies considerably by education and income. For example, 71% of higher-income Chinese believe corruption will improve in the next five years, compared with 58% of those with lower incomes.2 Roughly two-thirds of Chinese with a secondary education or higher (68%) expect corruption to get better, compared with about six-in-ten among people with less than a secondary education (59%). Despite concern about a wide range of issues, many are satisfied with their economic situation. Majorities in China have consistently rated their personal economic situation positively. In 2008, 66% of Chinese said their personal finances were good. In 2015, 72% hold this view. Roughly three-quarters of Chinese (77%) believe their family is better off today than they were five years ago. Only 4% say they are worse off financially than they were five years ago and 17% say they are about the same. Not only do many Chinese rate the current state of their finances positively, but an overwhelming majority sees the effects of China’s economic advancement over the past generation. Nearly all Chinese (96%) say their current standard of living is better than their parents’ standard of living at the same age. This is relatively unchanged from 2012, when 92% of Chinese said their standard of living was superior to that of their parents’ generation. China’s economic transformation has led to many changes in the everyday lives of its citizens. \t\tMost Chinese embrace a modern lifestyle, with 66% saying they like the pace of modern life.  \t\t However, the same percentage says their traditional way of life is getting lost. And 79% believe their way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence (though only 30% completely agree with this view). In \t\ta society with a rapidly growing middle class, slightly more than half (53%) think that consumerism and commercialism are a threat to their culture, up from 43% in 2012.  \t\t Just 34% say consumerism and commercialism do not pose a threat.","When asked whether a series of top problems will get better , get worse or stay the same in the next five years , the Chinese public offers mixed views . \t\t More than six - in - ten ( 63 % ) believe corruption problems will improve in the next five years .  \t\t  A plurality ( 43 % ) is also optimistic that progress will be made in food safety .

EVERY DAY EVERY FEW DAYS LESS OFTEN","From measuring teens’ internet usage to finding out what devices they own, Pew Research Center has been examining the digital lives of teenagers for over a decade. Our latest report focuses on how teens, who often live tech-saturated lives, develop and sustain friendships in the digital age, including where they meet, communicate and spend time with friends. Here are six key facts about teens, technology and friendships: 1More than half of teens have made at least one new friend online. Fully 57% of teenagers have met a new friend over the internet, with nearly three-in-ten teens (29%) saying they have made more than five friends this way. But most of these relationships remain online, with a majority (77%) of all teenagers saying they have never met an online friend in person. 2Social media sites are popular places for teens to make friends online: About two-thirds (64%) of teens who have met a friend online say they have met new friends via a social networking site. Additionally, a majority of teens say social media platforms have made them feel more connected to their friends’ lives and feelings. Roughly eight-in-ten social-media-using teens (83%) say that sites like Facebook or Instagram make them feel more connected to what is happening in their friends’ lives, while 70% say these social platforms make them feel more in tune with their friends’ feelings. 3For some teens, there are downsides to social media. Fully 68% of social-media-using teens say they have experienced drama among friends on the platform. More than half (53%) of teen social media users have seen postings on social media about something to which they weren’t invited, while some teens feel pressure to post only content that makes them look good (40%) or that will be popular (39%). 4Teens use a number of platforms and devices to keep in touch with friends, but text messaging is used on a daily basis much more than others. Roughly nine-in-ten teens (88%) spend time with their friends via text messaging at least occasionally, and 55% do so every day. Phone calling, instant messaging and social media are also popular ways for teens to spend time with friends, but in comparison with texting, they are used far less for daily interactions. Few teens keep in touch with friends on a daily basis by email or video chatting. 5Roughly one-in-four teens have fought with a friend because of something that first happened online or because of a text message. While a majority of teens have not fought with a friend over something that initially occurred online, 26% of teens have experienced this type of digitally facilitated conflict. Teen girls (32%) are more likely than their male counterparts (20%) to say they have had this type of conflict, while whites are more likely than blacks to have fought with a friend because of something that happened online. 6Video games play an important role in the development and maintenance of friendships – especially for teen boys. Roughly three-quarters (78%) of online gaming teens say they feel more connected to existing friends with whom they play games. For boys, that share is even higher, with 84% saying networked games make them feel more connected to friends when they play, compared with 62% of girls. Overall, boys are much more likely than girls to make new friends while playing games online (57% vs 13%). Boys also spend more time playing video games with friends: 16% of boys play videos games in person with friends every day or almost every day, compared with just 5% of girls.","Teens use a number of platforms and devices to keep in touch with friends , but text messaging is used on a daily basis much more than others .

The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe. Support for European economic integration – the 1957 raison d’etre for creating the European Economic Community, the European Union’s predecessor – is down over last year in five of the eight European Union countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2013. Positive views of the European Union are at or near their low point in most EU nations, even among the young, the hope for the EU’s future. The favorability of the EU has fallen from a median of 60% in 2012 to 45% in 2013. And only in Germany does at least half the public back giving more power to Brussels to deal with the current economic crisis. The sick man label – attributed originally to Russian Czar Nicholas I in his description of the Ottoman Empire in the mid-19th century – has more recently been applied at different times over the past decade and a half to Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France. But this fascination with the crisis country of the moment has masked a broader phenomenon: the erosion of Europeans’ faith in the animating principles that have driven so much of what they have accomplished internally. The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else. The southern nations of Spain, Italy and Greece are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with Brussels, Berlin and the perceived unfairness of the economic system. These negative sentiments are driven, in part, by the public’s generally glum mood about economic conditions and could well turn around if the European economy picks up. But Europe’s economic fortunes have worsened in the past year, and prospects for a rapid turnaround remain elusive. The International Monetary Fund expects the European Union economy to not grow at all in 2013 and to still be performing below its pre-crisis average in 2018. Nevertheless, despite the vocal political debate about austerity, a clear majority in five of eight countries surveyed still think the best way to solve their country’s economic problems is to cut government spending, not spend more money. These are among the key findings of a new study by the Pew Research Center conducted in eight European Union nations among 7,646 respondents from March 2 to March 27, 2013. No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France. In just the past year, the public mood has soured dramatically across the board. The French are negative about the economy, with 91% saying it is doing badly, up 10 percentage points since 2012. They are negative about their leadership: 67% think President Francois Hollande is doing a lousy job handling the challenges posed by the economic crisis, a criticism of the president that is 24 points worse than that of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. The French are also beginning to doubt their commitment to the European project, with 77% believing European economic integration has made things worse for France, an increase of 14 points since last year. And 58% now have a bad impression of the European Union as an institution, up 18 points from 2012. Even more dramatically, French attitudes have sharply diverged from German public opinion on a range of issues since the beginning of the euro crisis. Differences in opinion across the Rhine have long existed. But the French public mood is now looking less like that in Germany and more like that in the southern peripheral nations of Spain, Italy and Greece. Positive assessment of the economy in France have fallen by more than half since before the crisis and is now comparable to that in the south. The French share similar worries about inflation and unemployment with the Spanish, the Italians and the Greeks at levels of concern not held by the Germans. Only the Greeks and Italians have less belief in the benefits of economic union than do the French. The French now have less faith in the European Union as an institution than do the Italians or the Spanish. And the French, like their southern European compatriots, have lost confidence in their elected leader. Compounding their doubts about the Brussels-based European Union, Europeans are losing faith in the capacity of their own national leaders to cope with the economy’s woes. In most countries surveyed, fewer people today than a year ago think their national executive is doing a good job dealing with the euro crisis. This includes just 25% of the public in Italy, where the sitting Prime Minister Mario Monti was voted out while this survey was being conducted. Even the Germans, who overwhelmingly back their Chancellor Angela Merkel, are slightly more judgmental of her handling of Europe’s economic challenges than they were last year. And Merkel faces the voters in an election in September 2013. Nevertheless, Merkel remains the most popular leader in Europe, by a wide margin. She enjoys majority approval for her handling of the European economic crisis in five of the eight nations surveyed. But in Greece (88%) and Spain (57%), majorities now say she has done a bad job, as do half (50%) of those surveyed in Italy. Most Europeans are profoundly concerned about the state of their economies. Just 1% of the Greeks, 3% of the Italians, 4% of the Spanish and 9% of the French think economic conditions are good. Only the Germans (75%) are pleased with their economy. And the economic mood has worsened appreciably since before the euro crisis began. Positive sentiment is down 61 percentage points in Spain, 54 points in Britain, 22 points in Italy and 21 points in both the Czech Republic and France. But despair about the economy may have bottomed out in some nations since 2012. Sentiment seems to have stabilized in the Czech Republic and Poland. And the mood can’t get much worse in Spain, Italy and Greece. Most Europeans are almost as gloomy about the future. Just 11% of the French, 14% of the Greeks and Poles, and 15% of the Czechs think that their national economic situation will improve over the next 12 months. A median of 78% in the eight countries surveyed say a lack of jobs is a very big problem in their country. And a median of 71% cite the public debt. Except in Germany, overwhelming majorities in many countries say unemployment, the public debt, rising prices and the gap between the rich and the poor are very important problems. Unemployment is the number one worry in seven of the eight countries. Inequality is the principle concern in Germany. Apprehension about economic mobility and inequality is also widespread. Across the eight nations polled, a median of 66%, including 90% of the French, think children today will be worse off financially than their parents when they grow up. A median of 77% believe that the economic system generally favors the wealthy. This includes 95% of the Greeks, 89% of the Spanish and 86% of the Italians. A median of 60% think the gap between the rich and the poor is a very big problem; that sentiment is felt by 84% of the Greeks and 75% of both the Italians and the Spanish. And a median of 85% say such inequality has increased in the past five years, a concern particularly prevalent among the Spanish (90%). Absolute economic deprivation has long been less of an issue in Europe than in some other countries, thanks to the relatively robust European social safety net. But in the wake of economic hard times, deprivation in France is on the rise, where roughly one-in-five say they could not afford food, health care or clothing at some point in the past year. The euro crisis has created a southern challenge for the European Union. Spain, Italy and Greece have suffered greatly during the economic downturn. And the public mood in these countries is extremely bleak in both absolute and relative terms. More than seven-in-ten Spanish (79%) and Greeks (72%) say economic conditions are very bad. A majority of Italians (58%) say the same. This compares with a median of 28% for the rest of Europe. More than nine-in-ten in Greece (99%), Italy (97%) and Spain (94%) think the lack of employment opportunities is a very big problem (official unemployment in January 2013 was 27.2% in Greece and in March 2013 was 26.7% in Spain and 11.5% in Italy). Fully 94% of Greeks, 84% of Italians and 69% of Spanish complain that inflation also poses a very big challenge. This compares with a median of 58% elsewhere. And roughly seven-in-ten or more in all three countries fault their leader’s handing of the economic crisis. Such economic gloom has fed disgruntlement with the European Union. In Greece, 78% now believe that economic integration has weakened the Greek economy, a sentiment about their economy shared by 75% of the Italians and 60% of the Spanish. As a result, nearly two-thirds (65%) of Greeks and about half (52%) of the Spanish have an unfavorable view of the EU. This compares with medians of 59% who question integration and 48% who take a critical view of the EU in the other five countries surveyed. Concern about inequality is widespread throughout Europe, particularly in the south. A view that the economic system generally favors the wealthy is shared by 95% of the Greeks, 89% of the Spanish and 86% of the Italians. Such frustration exceeds the median of 72% in the other five nations surveyed. Similarly, 84% of the Greeks and 75% of the Italians and Spanish say the gap between the rich and the poor is a very big problem. That compares with a median of just 54% of the Europeans surveyed outside the region who hold such critical views. When asked which of the economic challenges facing their countries their government should address first, people in seven of the eight nations choose the lack of employment opportunities. A median of 57% first want their elected leaders to create more jobs. And employment is a particular priority in Spain (72%), Italy (64%) and the Czech Republic (64%). Europeans are of two minds about public debt, which has been at the center of the debate over the euro crisis since it began. A majority in six of the eight countries surveyed consider debt a very big problem. When pressed to choose between reducing public expenditures and more spending, most publics choose the former, even in Spain (67%) and Italy (59%), despite the fact that people there have already experienced cutbacks in government spending, economic contraction and record high unemployment. Across Europe a median of 59% believe that reducing public debt is the best way to solve their country’s economic problems. But a median of only 17% think debt reduction should be their government’s number one economic priority. Despite rising disillusionment with the European project, the euro, the common currency for 17 of the 27 European Union members, remains in public favor. More than six-in-ten people want to keep the euro as their currency in Greece (69%), Spain (67%), Germany (66%), Italy (64%) and France (63%). And support for the euro has actually increased in Italy and Spain since last year. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that only 26% of the British public think being a member of the European Union has been good for their economy and just 43% hold positive views of the European Union, the British, who will hold a referendum on continued EU membership in 2017, remain evenly divided on leaving the EU: 46% say stay and 46% say go. Overall, the 2013 survey highlights more starkly than ever the differences between the views of Germans and other Europeans on a range of issues. And it underscores that, in some cases, those differences are growing. Germans feel better than others about the economy (by 66 points over the EU median), about their personal finances (by 26 points), about the future (by 12 points), about the European Union (by 17 points), about European economic integration (by 28 points) and about their own elected leadership (by 48 points). And the survey contradicts oft-repeated narratives about the Germans: that they are paranoid about inflation, disinclined to bail out their fellow Europeans and debt-obsessed. To the contrary, Germans are among the least likely of those surveyed to see inflation as a very big problem and the most likely among the richer European nations to be willing to provide financial assistance to other European Union countries that have major financial problems. And while Germans are worried about public debt, they are more concerned about inequality and equally concerned about unemployment. The prominent role Germans have played in Europe’s response to the euro crisis has evoked decidedly mixed emotions from their fellow Europeans. In every country except Greece, people consider Germans the most trustworthy. At the same time, in six of the eight nations surveyed, people see the Germans as the least compassionate. And in five of the eight, they are considered the most arrogant. In the wake of the strict austerity measures imposed in Greece, Greek enmity toward the Germans knows little bound. Greeks consider the Germans to be the least trustworthy, the most arrogant and the least compassionate. But the Greeks themselves do not fare that well. They are considered the least trustworthy by the French, the Germans and the Czechs.","Moreover , notwithstanding the fact that only 26 % of the British public think being a member of the European Union has been good for their economy and just 43 % hold positive views of the European Union , the British , who will hold a referendum on continued EU membership in 2017 , remain evenly divided on leaving the EU : 46 % say stay and 46 % say go .","Compare the British approval and rejection levels about being a member of the EU?","The British , remain evenly divided on leaving the EU : 46 % say stay and 46 % say go .","the British , remain evenly divided on leaving the EU : 46 % say stay and 46 % say go ."],"4326":["4326.png","In U.S., demographic differences on views of NAFTA has The been North good American thing Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, has been a good thing for the U.S. Agreement,","The Trump administration and governments in Ottawa and Mexico City have indicated they will renegotiate the trilateral, quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While the existing accord enjoys the support of roughly three-quarters of the Canadian public and six-in-ten Mexicans, it is viewed less favorably in the United States, with Republicans far less supportive than Democrats, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of all three countries. About half of Americans (51%) say NAFTA has been a good thing for the U.S., including 11% who say it has been very good. That compares with 74% of Canadians who say the agreement has been good for Canada, including 20% who say it has been very good. Among Mexicans, 60% see NAFTA as being good for their country, including 10% who hold that view strongly. These differences in views may, in part, reflect the fact that both Canada and Mexico run merchandise trade surpluses with the U.S. In 2016, the U.S. ran a collective $74 billion trade goods deficit with its two NAFTA partners. Political partisanship is linked to views of NAFTA, most notably in the U.S. About two-thirds (68%) of Democrats see NAFTA as good for the U.S., while only 30% of Republicans hold that view. And intensity of sentiment differs widely along party lines: While 33% of Republicans believe NAFTA has been very bad for the country, only 6% of Democrats agree. In the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, NAFTA was the focus of strong criticism by then-candidate Donald Trump. Recently, President Trump reiterated his view that NAFTA “has been a disaster for the United States.” Public support for NAFTA is somewhat higher today than it was in 2005, the last time Pew Research Center and Gallup regularly polled about the agreement. And after a decline in support for free trade agreements in general during the 2016 campaign, a plurality of Americans support them again, according to a separate 2017 Pew Research Center survey. In Canada, large majorities across the political spectrum support NAFTA, according to the Center’s new survey: Conservatives (83%) and Liberals (82%), as well as supporters of the New Democratic Party (70%), say it has been a good thing for Canada. In Mexico, 68% of those who identify with the National Action Party (PAN) believe NAFTA has been a good thing for Mexico. A smaller majority of Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) supporters (59%) agree. Canada and Mexico are the two largest destination countries for U.S. exports and the second- and third-largest sources of imports (after China), according to the latest Census Bureau report on international trade in goods and services. In 2016, Canada and Mexico together accounted for a little over 26% of total U.S. exports of goods and services and 23.5% of total imports. Aside from crude oil and other fossil fuels, which were the second-biggest imports from Canada last year ($54.2 billion), the largest categories of exports and imports to and from both Canada and Mexico are similar: motor vehicles and parts, heavy machinery and electrical and electronic equipment – an indication of how closely integrated the three nations’ economies are. U.S. demographic divides on NAFTA In addition to their party differences, Americans differ about NAFTA along gender, age and racial and ethnic lines. Women (55%) are more likely than men (46%) to believe that the trilateral trade agreement has been good for the U.S. And about twice as many men (25%) as women (12%) say NAFTA has been very bad for the country. Roughly six-in-ten (62%) Americans ages 18 to 29 – who were children or not even born when NAFTA was signed – voice the view that the trade deal has been good for the country; only 26% see it as bad. Those ages 50 and older lean in the opposite direction: 44% see the accord positively, while 49% see it negatively, including 22% who believe it has been very bad for the U.S. Hispanics (66%) and African Americans (59%) say NAFTA has been good for the U.S., but just 46% of non-Hispanic whites agree.

That represents more than 17 million people. However, the number of people who say they download music files increased from an estimated 18 million to 23 million since the Project’s November-December 2003 survey. The Pew Internet Project poll shows that a third of the former music downloaders, close to 6 million Internet users, say they have turned away from downloading because of the suits brought against music file-sharers by the Recording Industry Association of America. The retreat is particularly pronounced among online men, Internet users between the ages of 18-29, and those who have broadband connections at home. Furthermore, among Internet users who have never tried music downloading, 60% say the RIAA lawsuits would keep them from downloading music files in the future. Women with Internet access are more likely than online men to say they are deterred by the law suits. New data from comScore Media Metrix, based on the company’s continuously and passively measured consumer panel, show – with variations by application and month analyzed – continuing declines or stagnancy in the number of people with popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications actively running on their computers. Since our last data memo on downloading, in which we reported comScore data gathered between November 2002 and November 2003, the KaZaa user base dropped most notably. Between November 2003 and February 2004 alone, comScore estimates that over 5 million fewer people are actively running KaZaa. The current music downloader population and the emergence of paid music services The number of those who say they download music online remains well below the peak levels that we tracked in the spring of 2003, but there was some growth in those who reported music downloading in our February survey. The comScore data also shows growth since last November in usage of some of the smaller file-sharing applications, such as iMesh, BitTorrent, and eMule. In the most recent survey, we found that 18% of Internet users said they download music files. That is a modest increase from the 14% of Internet users who reported in a survey just before last Christmas that they downloaded music files online. But it is still considerably below the 29% who said they had done this when we surveyed in the spring of 2003. Among current music downloaders, 38% say they are downloading less because of the RIAA suits. In the pre-Christmas survey, we found that 27% of music downloaders said they had throttled back on their practices because of the RIAA suits. That represents a significant jump in just two months. About a third of current music downloaders say they use peer-to-peer networks. Another 24% of them say they swap files using email and instant messaging; 20% download files from music-related Web sites like those run by music magazines or musician homepages. And while online music services like iTunes are far from trumping the popularity of file-sharing networks, 17% of current music downloaders say they are using these paid services. Overall, 7% of Internet users say they have bought music at these new services at one time or another, including 3% who currently use paid services. Moreover, March data from comScore Media Metrix indicate that more than 11 million U.S. Internet users visited six major online music services – an impressive audience considering the relative newness of several entrants to the category. iTunes, which reached more than 2.3 million Americans in March, has added nearly a million unique visitors since October 2003. It is still the case that a majority of music downloaders are indifferent to copyright – 58% of them said they did not care about the copyright on the files that they download in the February survey. Still, there has been striking growth in the number of downloaders who say they do care about the copyright on those files. In the March-May 2003 survey, we asked music downloaders if they cared whether or not the music they downloaded was copyrighted and 27% said yes. The figure from the February 2004 survey was 37%. Some of the most notable increases in concern about copyright have occurred among online men, those in the Baby Boom generation, and among those with college degrees and relatively high levels of household income. Inside the downloader population, men are 50% more likely to have downloaded songs compared to women. And 38% of those ages 18-29 say they download songs. This is a figure considerably lower than the rates we were tracking in the first half of 2003, when more than 50% of this population downloaded songs. Online video downloading Some 15% of Internet users report they have downloaded video files onto their computer, up from 13% who said they had done so in our November-December survey. Online men are twice as likely as women to have done this. And young adults (those ages 18 to 29) are twice as likely as older Internet users to have done this. However, as bandwidth constraints become less of an issue for users, it is likely that video downloading will become significantly more widespread. Sharing files online Those who say they share files from their own computer, such as music, video or picture files, or computer games rose slightly to 23% in the February 2004 survey. In our November-December 2003 survey, 20% of all Internet users said they shared files with others online. Still, that reflects a significant drop from the 28% who reported this last June. Equal portions of online men and women say they share files, but young adults are much more likely to share when compared to older users. Background Since January when we issued our last report on downloading, the recording industry has continued its campaign against unauthorized file-sharing online. In March, the RIAA announced an additional 532 lawsuits against Internet users accused of illegal file-sharing, bringing the total number sued to 1,977.2 According to the RIAA, music CD sales dropped from a high of $13.2 billion in 2000 to $11.2 billion in 2003.3 And this April, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries reported a 7% decline in global music sales in 2003. Over the past three years, the IFPI reports a 20% total sales drop and it attributes the majority of this decline to Internet piracy.4 However, many have questioned arguments about file-sharing’s negative impact on sales. Some argue that multiple factors might have contributed to the current slump, such as fewer releases, higher prices, and a struggling economy. Moreover, a newly released two-year economic study published by Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School and Koleman S. Strumpf of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill argues that peer-to-peer file-sharing has had no measurable effect on music sales.5 Some recent news articles have reported that some music labels regularly pay for and use detailed tracking information gleaned from peer-to-peer networks for targeted marketing aimed at boosting sales.6 On March 31st, a House Judiciary subcommittee unanimously approved the Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2004 (PDEA). If the PDEA is passed into law, those who circulate copyrighted files online could face up to three years of jail time. The bill is specifically targeted towards Internet users who share 1,000 or more songs during a 180-day period and includes provisions for the FBI, the Copyright Office, and the Justice Department to establish piracy deterrence and education programs. Afterword In January 2004, the Pew Internet & American Life Project and comScore Media Metrix released a joint data memo on downloading and file-sharing titled, “Sharp Decline in Music File Swappers.” The findings presented in the memo reported a dramatic drop in self-reported downloading and file-sharing in the months following the announcement of the RIAA lawsuits, and as such, they were widely discussed. As part of the ongoing public debate over downloading and copyright issues online, the Pew Internet survey data and the comScore panel data were compared to other pieces of research on the subject. And despite considerable variations in existing research methodologies for studying downloading and file-sharing activity, other publicly released data by other research firms, including The NPD Group and Neilsen//NetRatings registered relatively congruent declines in Americans’ overall downloading and usage of peer-to-peer services during the same period. The January 2004 Pew Internet/comScore Media Metrix data memo reported findings from two sources. First, a nationally representative RDD telephone survey of 1,358 American adult Internet users conducted by the Pew Internet Project in November and December of 2003 showed a 50% drop in the percentage of individual Internet users who reported music downloading when compared to the Project’s March-May 2003 survey. Independently gathered data from comScore’s passively measured consumer panel also observed a substantial and continuous decline in individual usage of popular peer-to-peer file-sharing applications from June 2003 onward.  In total, comScore measures the behavior and attitudes of more than 1.5 million global Internet users, of which a representative U.S. sample of approximately 100,000 was used to produce the comScore Media Metrix data cited in our report. Research from The NPD Group tracked a similar decline in music downloading among Americans during the period between May and September 2003. Data gathered through NPD’s bi-monthly MusicLab survey, conducted among approximately 5,000 respondents aged 13 and older, showed a decrease of 20% in the population who said they downloaded music from peer-to-peer services in May to 11% who reported this in September. By November, NPD reported that the incidence of peer-to-peer downloading had ticked up to 12%, still well below peak levels. Separate data gathered from NPD’s MusicWatch service, which follows household usage of peer-to-peer applications by monitoring the PCs of volunteer consumer panelists, recorded a six-month decline between April and September 2003. However, the number of households downloading music files then reportedly grew 14% between September and November.7 Nielsen//NetRatings research reported in late September that usage of popular file-sharing applications was at an all-time low. Nielsen//NetRatings first observed a decline in July, when unique visitors to KaZaA, Morpheus and iMesh all dropped by roughly 15% immediately following the announcement of the RIAA lawsuits.8 Unique visitors of these applications continued to decline throughout the summer and by September (after most schools were back in session), there had been a total 41% plunge in traffic to the KaZaA application alone (recorded between the week ending June 29 and the week ending September 21).9 About The Pew Internet & American Life Project The Pew Internet & American Life Project is a non-profit initiative, fully-funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts to explore the impact of the Internet on children, families, communities, health care, schools, the work place, and civic/political life.

For the first time, a majority (56%) says that U.S. troops should be brought home as soon as possible, while 39% favor keeping troops in Afghanistan until the situation has stabilized. The proportion favoring a quick withdrawal of U.S. forces has increased by eight points since last month (from 48%), immediately after the killing of Osama bin Laden. A year ago, just 40% favored removing the troops as soon as possible, while 53% favored keeping them in Afghanistan until the situation stabilized. Americans continue to say the decision to use force in Afghanistan was the right one, and 58% believe the United States will definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. That is largely unchanged from the 62% who said the U.S. would achieve its goals in Afghanistan shortly after Osama’s death. But at the same time, a majority (56%) says it is unlikely that Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government after the U.S. military leaves. Even among those who predict the U.S. will be successful in Afghanistan, nearly as many favor removing the troops as soon possible (46%) as favor keeping then there until the situation is stable (51%). Among those who say the U.S. will definitely or probably fail in achieving its goals – 34% of the public – a large majority (75%) supports removing the troops as soon as possible. Over the past year, support for removing U.S. troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible has increased across nearly all political and demographic groups. Two-thirds of Democrats (67%) now say troops should be removed as soon as possible, up from 43% a year ago. A majority (57%) of independents also support immediate troop withdrawal, an increase of 15 points from last year. Republican support for removing U.S. troops as soon as possible has risen 12 points since last June. At that time, 65% of Republicans favored keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan until the situation is stabilized while 31% favored removing them as soon as possible. In the current survey, 53% support keeping the troops there and 43% favor their withdrawal. Over the past year, support for withdrawing the troops has doubled among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents who agree with the Tea Party. A year ago only 21% favored immediate troop withdrawal; that has risen to 42% currently. A majority (57%) continues to say the U.S. made the right decision in using military force in Afghanistan while 35% said it was the wrong decision. Republicans are more likely than Democrats and independents to say it was the right decision. The public’s assessments of the military effort in Afghanistan have changed little over the past few months – 53% say the military effort is going at least fairly well. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats and independents to say the effort is going well. Optimism about success in Afghanistan increased after bin Laden’s death and remains higher than it was last year – 58% say the U.S. will definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. But Republicans (67%) and Democrats (61%) are more optimistic about success than independents (51%). Only 38% says that it is likely Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government when U.S. military forces leave the country while 56% say it is unlikely. In November 2009 the public was more optimistic about Iraq – 52% said it was at least somewhat likely Iraq would be able to maintain a stable government after U.S. forces left. There are very little partisan differences – a majority across party lines says it is unlikely Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government.","The proportion favoring a quick withdrawal of U.S. forces has increased by eight points since last month ( from 48 % ) , immediately after the killing of Osama bin Laden .

Trump’s former energy secretary Rick Perry has said the president is “here at this chosen time because God ordained it.” Evangelist Franklin Graham has said that “God was behind the last election.” But how many Americans believe Trump was chosen by God to be president? And among those who think God’s hand was involved in the 2016 election, in what sense do they think God was at work? A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 27% of U.S. adults believe Trump’s election reflects God’s will in the sense that the 2016 outcome must be part of God’s overall plan, but that this doesn’t necessarily mean God approves of Trump’s policies. Far fewer U.S. adults – just 5% – say God chose Trump because God approves of his policies. About half of Americans say God doesn’t get involved in U.S. presidential elections (49%), while the remainder say they don’t believe in God (16%). Americans hold very similar opinions about the election of President Barack Obama: 29% say Obama’s elections in 2008 and 2012 were part of God’s broader plan, but just 3% say God chose him to be president because God approved of his policies. Among religious groups, white evangelical Protestants and black Protestants are more likely than others to say that recent presidential elections reflect God’s will in some way: A majority of white evangelicals (56%) and roughly half of black Protestants (48%) say it must be part of God’s plan that Trump or Obama – or both – were elected, but that this doesn’t necessarily mean God favored their policies. Additionally, small shares of white evangelicals and black Protestants do think that God tipped the outcome based on policy considerations, though they differ about God’s preference. Among white evangelical Protestants, 11% say God chose Trump but not Obama because God favored Trump’s policies, while only 2% say God favored Obama on policy grounds, but not Trump. Among black Protestants, 12% say Obama’s election (but not Trump’s) reflects divine endorsement of his policies, while only 4% say this about Trump (but not Obama). Among all other religious groups, large majorities say that God doesn’t get involved in presidential elections or that they don’t believe in God. That’s the case for 86% of the religiously unaffiliated, including almost all atheists (98%) and agnostics (96%), as well as eight-in-ten Jewish Americans, seven-in-ten Catholics and two-thirds of white Protestants who do not identify as born-again or evangelical. There also are divisions on this question by party. Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say the election of Trump or Obama (or both) was part of God’s overall plan though not necessarily a divine endorsement of their policies (35% vs. 20%). Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say that God stays out of presidential elections or that they do not believe in God. While most Americans do not believe God has intervened in recent presidential elections, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey that asked more general questions about the nature of God found that seven-in-ten U.S. adults do believe that there is a God or a higher power in the universe that knows everything that goes on in the world, and six-in-ten believe that God has the power to direct or change everything that happens in the world. Note: Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.","A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 27 % of U.S. adults believe Trump ’s election reflects God ’s will in the sense that the 2016 outcome must be part of God ’s overall plan , but that this does n’t necessarily mean God approves of Trump ’s policies .

Overall, 58% of U.S. adults feel the news media do not understand people like them, while 40% feel they are understood, as reported in a recent Pew Research Center study. Republicans, however, are nearly three times as likely to feel that news organizations don’t understand them (73%) as they are to say they feel understood (25%). By comparison, most Democrats (58%) say they feel understood by the news media, while four-in-ten say they do not. Not only are Republicans far more likely to feel misunderstood by the news media, they feel this way regardless of their media habits and demographic characteristics, according to the analysis of data collected Feb. 22 to March 4, 2018, among 5,035 U.S. adults. About three-quarters of Republicans who are very interested in the news (74%) say news organizations do not understand people like them – about the same share as among those who are somewhat interested (70%) and not interested in the news (78%). Among Democrats, however, news interest plays a large role in whether they feel misunderstood. About a quarter of Democrats who are very interested in the news feel misunderstood (27%), compared with about four-in-ten of the somewhat interested (39%) and roughly half of those not interested (52%). Still, Democrats at all levels of news interest are much less likely than Republicans to feel misunderstood by the news media. (For more on the measure of news interest, see this report.) Republicans differ little across various demographic groups in saying people like them are misunderstood by the media. For example, Republicans have high levels of feeling misunderstood across sex, age and education groups (between 70% and 76% in each group say they feel misunderstood). Among Democrats, however, there are differences across demographic traits, especially when it comes to education and age. About three-in-ten Democrats with at least a college degree (29%) feel misunderstood by the news media, compared with 42% of those with some college education and 47% of those with a high school diploma or less. Democrats ages 50 and older are also less likely to feel misunderstood than those under age 50 (35% vs. 44%). Overall, independents fall somewhere between Republicans and Democrats in feeling misunderstood by the news media (63% say this), though whether they lean to the Republican or Democratic Party has a strong influence. Independents who lean to the Republican Party are far more likely to feel misunderstood than those who lean Democratic (80% vs. 51%, respectively, say they feel misunderstood by the news media). The deep divides between Republicans and Democrats in feeling misunderstood by news organizations is largely in line with partisan divides in trust in national media and perceived fairness in news coverage. As seen in previous findings, Republicans are far less likely than Democrats to say they have a lot of trust in the information they get from national news organizations and are more likely to think the news media tend to favor one side.

Currently, 56% say the news they are hearing about the economy is a mix of good and bad, while 36% say the news is mostly bad. This is the first time since May that significantly more view news about the economy as mixed than mostly bad. As has been the case for the past three years, very few people (6% currently) say the news they are hearing about the economy is mostly good. Despite the improving perceptions of economic news, however, somewhat more say they are hearing mostly bad economic news today than did so at the start of the year (24% in January). The economy was the public’s top story last week, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Dec. 1-4 among 1,008 adults by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Three-in-ten (30%) say they followed news about the economy more closely than any other story. Somewhat fewer (23%) cited the presidential campaign as their top story. News about the presidential election – much of it focused on the final days of Herman Cain’s bid for the Republican nomination – topped news coverage, accounting for 23% of the newshole. News about the economy made up 17%, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). The survey was in the field on Dec. 3 when Cain announced he was suspending his campaign. And, in a week that started with a Georgia woman alleging that she and Cain had had a lengthy affair, Cain was by far the most prominent candidate in the GOP field. More than four-in-ten (43%) say the former pizza company executive was the candidate they heard the most about in the news recently. Just more than one-in-ten (13%) mention Newt Gingrich, whose candidacy gained traction as Cain’s lost momentum. Just 5% say Mitt Romney was the candidate they heard the most about. Since confronted at the end of October with allegations of sexual harassment in the 1990s, Cain has been the campaign’s top newsmaker each week, according to PEJ. As views of overall economic news have become less negative, perceptions of news from economic sectors have improved as well. Following a week of large stock market gains, about as many say they are hearing mixed news about financial markets (43%) as say they are hearing mostly bad news (38%). Last month, more said the news was mostly bad rather than mixed (by 50% to 41%). In August, more than twice as many were hearing mostly bad news than mixed news (69% vs. 25%). With the November federal jobs report showing a drop in the unemployment rate from 9% to 8.6%, fewer also are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation. Still, about half (51%) say recent news about jobs has been mostly bad; 37% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news and 10% report hearing mostly good news. The percentage saying they are hearing mostly bad news about jobs has declined 13 points since last month and 23 points since August. Compared with a year ago, far more Americans say recent news about retail sales has been mostly good. Currently 51% say the news about retail sales has been mostly positive, up from 33% at the same point in last year’s holiday shopping season. This marks the first time when as many as half have said they are hearing mostly good news about any economic sector in a measure that dates to 2009. Perceptions of overall economic news, as well as news about jobs, financial markets and retail sales, continue to be divided along partisan lines. Nonetheless, there have been across-the-board declines in the percentages saying they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy. Currently, 45% of Republicans, 38% of independents and 29% of Democrats say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy. In August, clear majorities of Republicans (71%), independents (69%) and Democrats (62%) viewed economic news negatively. As might be expected, more Americans (43%) say they heard about Herman Cain in the news recently than any other Republican candidate. But Newt Gingrich’s visibility is clearly on the rise. In September and October, virtually no one in the public, or among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, named Gingrich as the GOP candidate they were hearing most about. Today, 13% of the public and 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners name Gingrich as the candidate they have been hearing the most about recently. By contrast, just 5% of the public – and the same percentage of Republicans and GOP leaners – name Romney as the candidate they are hearing most about. That is down from 18% among the public and 20% among GOP and GOP leaners in October. In a sign of the volatility of the GOP campaign, five different Republican candidates or possible candidates – including Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and Donald Trump – have led the list of most visible candidates since April. With Herman Cain’s troubles getting extensive press coverage, most Americans are able to identify him as the candidate accused of sexually harassing several women in the 1990s. In an open-ended question, 60% offer Cain’s name when asked which candidate confronted these allegations. Fewer are able to connect other GOP candidates to events or news about them that have become part of the campaign. Just more than a third (36%) offer Rick Perry’s name when asked which candidate had a memory lapse during a presidential debate. While some offer other names, most (52%) say they do not know. About three-in-ten (29%) offer Mitt Romney’s name when asked which candidate has been called a flip-flopper. No other candidate is mentioned by more than 4%. Close to six-in-ten (58%) offer no response. Just 20% offer Newt Gingrich’s name when asked which candidate had an extensive line of credit at the Tiffany jewelry story. About three-quarters (74%) say they do not know. The credit line briefly became news in May just after Gingrich’s rocky entrance into the GOP race. In awareness of this story, as well as of other campaign events, there are only modest partisan differences. Four-in-ten (40%) say they followed reports about the condition of the economy very closely last week, a level that has changed little throughout much of 2011. Three-in-ten (30%) say this was the news they followed most closely. A quarter (25%) say they followed news about the 2012 campaign very closely, about the same level of interest as the previous week; 23% say this was the news they followed most closely. Just under two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about the latest conflict betweenthe U.S. and Pakistan very closely. This was the top story for 6% and accounted for 3% of coverage,according to PEJ. Interest continued to be modest in the economic crisis in Europe; 14% say they followed news about efforts to deal with the debt crisis very closely; 4% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the situation accounted for 8% of coverage. About one-in-ten (12%) say they very closely followed news about tensions between Great Britain and Iran following an attack on the British embassy by Iranian protesters; 3% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the situation in Iran accounted for 2% of coverage. Just 7% say they followed news about the elections in Egypt very closely. Interest in events in Egypt was much greater early in the year when anti-government protests lead to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. In mid-February, 39% said they were following news about the situation in Egypt very closely. Just 1% say the elections in Egypt were their top story last week. The elections made up 5% of coverage. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected Nov. 28-Dec. 4, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected Dec. 1-4 from a nationally representative sample of 1,008 adults.","The economy was the public ’s top story last week , according to the latest News Interest Index survey , conducted Dec. 1 - 4 among 1,008 adults by Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press .

The two East Asian nations have a centuries-old relationship, punctuated by major conflict and strife. Most recently, Beijing and Tokyo have been at loggerheads about sovereignty over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, called the Senkaku by the Japanese and the Diaoyu by the Chinese. Today, only 11% of the Japanese express a favorable opinion of China, while 14% of the Chinese say they have a positive view of Japan. In both countries positive views of the other nation have decreased since 2006. Sino-Japanese antipathy can also be seen in a regional context. Influenced by history, economic ties and current events, Asian publics’ views of each other vary widely. Australia has strong economic ties with both China and Japan. China accounts for 34% of Australia’s exports, while Japan is Australia’s second-largest export market, accounting for 18% of Australian exports. About eight-in-ten Australians (79%) voice a favorable opinion of Japan. But only 52% express positive sentiment about China. Indians are also more positive on Japan than on China. A plurality of Indians have a favorable view of Japan (44%), while a much smaller share (22%) see Japan in a negative light. China, on the other hand, gets more negative reviews in India (36%) than positive reviews (31%). About a third of the Indian public expresses no opinion on China or Japan. These are the key findings of a Pew Research Center survey of 7,618 respondents in four countries: China, Japan, Australia and India. The survey was conducted April 6 to May 29, 2016. Stereotypes can reveal a great deal about the assumptions, sometimes biased or prejudiced, that influence how people view members of other groups. In the case of China and Japan, publics tend to hold largely negative stereotypes of one another. The Chinese and the Japanese see each other as violent. Roughly eight-in-ten Japanese describe the Chinese as arrogant, while seven-in-ten Chinese see the Japanese in that light. Notably, about three-quarters of the Japanese say the Chinese are nationalistic. But only about four-in-ten Chinese associate that word with the Japanese. Neither public sees the other as honest. A generation gap exists among the Japanese in their views of the Chinese. Older Japanese – those ages 50 and older – are more likely than Japanese ages 18 to 34 to see the Chinese as nationalistic. And older Japanese are less likely than the younger generation to believe that the Chinese are hardworking or modern. History remains a neuralgic issue in Sino-Japanese relations. Seven decades after the end of World War II, the two publics have starkly differing perceptions of whether Japan has expressed adequate regret for its wartime behavior. Roughly half the Japanese say their country has apologized sufficiently for its military actions during the 1930s and 1940s. And such sentiment is up 13 percentage points since 2006. The Chinese see this issue quite differently. Just 10% of Chinese believe Japan has apologized enough. And the difference between Japanese and Chinese sentiment has grown from 37 points to 43 points in the past decade. Not only do perceptions of the countries’ shared history differ, but expectations for the future of the Sino-Japanese relationship are also largely negative. Eight-in-ten Japanese (80%) and about six-in-ten Chinese (59%) are concerned that territorial disputes between China and its neighbors could lead to a military conflict. Japanese attitudes toward China are marked by partisan divides. Supporters of the country’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are more critical of China than are supporters of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Fully 46% of Japanese who identify with the ruling LDP have a very unfavorable view of China. Only 30% of those who support the opposition DPJ share such intense negativity. Notably, those who identify with the LDP are also more critical of South Korea than are backers of the DPJ. LDP and DPJ supporters also differ on Chinese nationalism: DPJ adherents are far more likely than LDP backers to see the Chinese as nationalistic (87% vs. 72% respectively). In addition, LDP supporters (59%) are more likely than DPJ adherents (47%) to believe that Japan has apologized sufficiently for its military actions in the 1930s and 1940s. For their part, DPJ supporters are much more likely to say that Japan has not apologized sufficiently. And while 22% of those with the LDP say there is nothing Tokyo needs to apologize for, just 12% of DPJ backers agree. Just 11% of Japanese express a favorable view of China today. And over the past decade, the average favorability of China among Japanese has been just 18%. Japanese animosity toward China varies somewhat by generation. Older Japanese – those ages 50 and older – are particularly unfavorable toward China (48% very unfavorable). Japanese ages 18 to 34 are less intensely negative (32% very unfavorable). For their part, the Chinese likewise have little regard for Japan. Today, only 14% voice a favorable opinion of their Asian neighbor, in line with the average of available data over the past decade. Both the Japanese and the Chinese see their other major Asian neighbors more positively than they do each other, though they still often view other neighbors in a negative light as well. More than half (54%) of Japanese have a favorable opinion of India, down from 65% in 2006. In contrast, only 27% of Japanese express a favorable view of South Korea. The legacy of Japan’s colonial occupation of Korea remains a sore point in bilateral relations. And Seoul has recently pressed Tokyo to accept greater responsibility for “comfort women,” Korean women pressed into work as sex workers during World War II. This may explain why the 2016 favorability of South Korea in Japan is roughly half the positive Japanese sentiment (56%) expressed in 2006. In stark contrast, 55% of Chinese voice a favorable opinion of South Korea. Such sentiment has decreased slightly from 2006 (63%). The Chinese are far less positively disposed toward India. Just 26% hold a favorable view of their southern neighbor, with whom China has had numerous territorial disputes for more than a half century. Over the last decade Chinese opinion of India has drifted downward from 33% favorable in 2006. The Chinese and Japanese have held fairly strong and often negative stereotypes of each other for some time. And in some instances these views have worsened over the past decade. In 2006, half of Japanese viewed the Chinese as violent. In 2016, roughly seven-in-ten Japanese saw the Chinese in that negative light. In addition, fully 74% of Japanese ages 50 and older see the Chinese as violent, while 60% of Japanese ages 18 to 34 view the Chinese in that manner. Roughly eight-in-ten Japanese associate arrogance with the Chinese. Only about two-thirds said the Chinese were arrogant a decade ago. More than six-in-ten Japanese (64%) thought the Chinese were hardworking in 2006, but now only around four-in-ten (42%) view them in that way. Again, it is older Japanese who are more critical (although older Japanese are more likely to voice no opinion): Only 35% of Japanese ages 50 and older associate the attribute hardworking with the Chinese, while 60% of younger Japanese see the Chinese in that light. Largely unchanged among Japanese is the belief that the Chinese are modern: 29% said that about the Chinese 10 years ago, and 25% hold that opinion today. Japanese sentiment toward the Chinese has changed slightly on perceptions of the Chinese being nationalistic. In 2006, 82% believed the Chinese were nationalistic. Today 76% see them that way. A generation gap divides this Japanese perception: 80% of older Japanese say the Chinese are nationalistic, while 65% of younger Japanese agree. And 87% of the DPJ and 72% of the LDP supporters see the Chinese as nationalistic. The Chinese also subscribe to negative stereotypes of the Japanese. Seven-in-ten or more Chinese associate violence (74%) and arrogance (70%) with the Japanese. The former view is up 9 percentage points since 2006. Only half the Chinese see the Japanese as modern, down from roughly two-thirds a decade ago. And the proportion of Chinese (34%) who see the Japanese as hardworking has nearly halved since 2006 (61%). As a point of comparison, in a 2015 Pew Research Center survey, 94% of Americans believed the Japanese to be hardworking. At the same time, the Chinese have become less critical of Japanese nationalism. Roughly two-thirds of Chinese thought the Japanese were nationalistic in 2006; around four-in-ten see them that way today. Notably, only 15% of the Chinese believe the Japanese are honest, unchanged from a decade ago. The Japanese hold the Chinese in a similarly low regard – 12% view them as honest – and this is roughly half the number who found the Chinese honest 10 years ago. (In the 2015 survey 71% of Americans saw the Japanese as honest.) Japanese atonement for its activities in China before and during World War II is an ongoing source of friction in Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese believe they have expressed regret for their behavior, while the Chinese disagree. Among the Japanese people, 53% say they have apologized enough for their country’s military actions during the 1930s and 1940s. Such sentiment is up from 40% in 2006. Over that time period, the proportion of the public that believes Japan has not apologized sufficiently has fallen by 21 percentage points, from 44% to 23%. Notably, one-in-six Japanese (17%) say no apology is necessary. The Chinese see Tokyo’s war-related penitence quite differently. Roughly three-quarters (77%) say Japan has not adequately expressed regret, and such Chinese sentiment is largely unchanged since 2006. Only 10% believe Tokyo has apologized enough. Sino-Japanese frictions are not only an issue of historical concern. In East Asia such tensions remain an ever-present worry as Beijing and Tokyo engage in a prolonged dispute about who has sovereignty over the Senkaku or Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. Eight-in-ten Japanese are very (35%) or somewhat (45%) concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighboring countries could lead to a military conflict. Only 19% are not too concerned or not concerned at all. Notably, 42% of people ages 50 and older are very concerned, but just 28% of Japanese ages 18 to 34 are similarly concerned. The Chinese are somewhat less worried. Roughly six-in-ten are very concerned (18%) or somewhat concerned (41%). Notably, intense concern among the Japanese about a potential conflict is about twice that found among the Chinese. And twice as many Chinese as Japanese are not too concerned or not concerned at all. Of course, territorial disputes between China and its neighboring countries involve more nations that just Japan. In a 2015 Pew Research Center survey, 91% of Filipinos and 83% of Vietnamese were worried that such disputes – which for these nations also involve China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea – could lead to a military conflict.

Support for increasing the level of legal immigration has risen, while the share saying legal immigration should decrease has fallen. The survey by Pew Research Center, conducted June 5-12 among 2,002 adults, finds that 38% say legal immigration into the United States should be kept at its present level, while 32% say it should be increased and 24% say it should be decreased. Since 2001, the share of Americans who favor increased legal immigration into the U.S. has risen 22 percentage points (from 10% to 32%), while the share who support a decrease has declined 29 points (from 53% to 24%). The shift is mostly driven by changing views among Democrats. The share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who say legal immigration into the U.S. should be increased has doubled since 2006, from 20% to 40%. Republicans’ views also have changed, though more modestly. The share of Republicans and Republican leaners who say legal immigration should be decreased has fallen 10 percentage points since 2006, from 43% to 33%. Still, about twice as many Republicans (33%) as Democrats (16%) support cutting legal immigration into the U.S. The new survey, which was largely conducted before the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border involving immigrant children being separated from their parents, finds deep and persistent partisan divisions in a number of attitudes toward immigrants, as well as widespread misperceptions among the public overall about the share of the immigrant population in the U.S. that is in this country illegally: Fewer than half of Americans know that most immigrants in the U.S. are here legally. Just 45% of Americans say that most immigrants living in the U.S. are here legally; 35% say most immigrants are in the country illegally, while 6% volunteer that about half are here legally and half illegally and 13% say they don’t know. In 2015, the most recent year for which data are available, lawful immigrants accounted for about three-quarters of the foreign-born population in the United States. Most feel sympathy toward unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) are very or somewhat sympathetic toward immigrants who are in the United States illegally. That view has changed little since 2014, when a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America attempted to enter the U.S. at the border. An overwhelming share of Democrats (86%) say they are sympathetic toward immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, compared with about half of Republicans (48%) . Fewer say granting legal status to unauthorized immigrants is a “reward.” Just 27% of Americans say that giving people who are in the U.S. illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong. More than twice as many (67%) say they don’t think of it this way. Since 2015, the share saying that providing legal status for those in the U.S. illegally is akin to a “reward” for doing something wrong has declined 9 percentage points. (Americans also broadly support granting legal status to immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.) Most Americans do not think undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes. Large majorities of Americans say that undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. are not more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes (65% say this) and that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs citizens don’t want (71% say this). These opinions, which also are divided along partisan lines, are virtually unchanged since 2016. Most people who encounter immigrants who do not speak English well aren’t bothered by this. Most Americans say they often (47%) or sometimes (27%) come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English. Among those who say this, just 26% say it bothers them, while 73% say it does not. The share saying they are bothered by immigrants speaking little or no English has declined by 12 percentage points since 2006 (from 38% to 26%) and 19 points since 1993 (from 45%). A majority of Americans are unaware that most immigrants in the United States are in this country legally. Overall, 45% know that most immigrants in the U.S. are here legally. Somewhat more give incorrect answers: 35% say most are here illegally, 6% say about half are here illegally and half legally and 13% do not give a response. According to estimates by Pew Research Center, legal immigrants made up about 75% of immigrants living in the United States in 2015, the most recent year for which data are available. There is a stark education gap in views of the legal status of most immigrants in the U.S. About six-in-ten (61%) of those with at least a college degree know that most immigrants are living here legally. In contrast, only about four-in-ten (38%) of those with no college degree know this. Younger people also are more likely to say that most immigrants living in the U.S. are here legally. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) of those ages 18 to 29 say this is the case, while only about a third (35%) of those 65 years and older say the same. Perceptions of the relative number of immigrants who are in the U.S. legally versus illegally are divided along party lines as well. Overall, 54% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe that most immigrants are living here legally, while about a third (36%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say this. Within both parties, those with four-year college degrees are more likely than those without a college degree to believe that most immigrants living in the U.S. are in this country legally (48% vs. 32% for Republicans; 69% vs. 46% for Democrats). Still, college-educated Democrats are 21 points more likely than college-educated Republicans to say most immigrants living in the U.S. are here legally. Most Americans continue to express positive views of undocumented immigrants when it comes to their impact on jobs and crime in the United States. About seven-in-ten Americans (71%) say that undocumented immigrants living in the United States mostly fill jobs that American citizens do not want. Nearly as many (65%) say undocumented immigrants are not more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes. Opinions on both measures are little changed since 2016. Across nearly all demographic groups, majorities say that undocumented immigrants do not have negative effects on job availability for U.S citizens and serious crime in the country. About eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (82%) say undocumented immigrants do not take jobs that American citizens want. By comparison, a smaller 57%-majority of Republicans and Republican leaners take this view. Republicans are divided over whether undocumented immigrants are more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes: 42% say they are more likely to commit serious crimes, while 46% say they are not. A large majority of Democrats (80%) say that undocumented immigrants are not more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes. Among Republicans, more conservatives (47%) than moderates and liberals (33%) associate undocumented immigrants with an increased likelihood of serious crime. There is a relationship between knowledge about the legal status of most immigrants in the country and attitudes about whether undocumented immigrants are more likely than American citizens to commit serious crimes. Among those who know that most immigrants in the U.S. are here legally, a large 77%-majority says that undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes than American citizens. By contrast, a smaller share of those who think most immigrants are here illegally (53%) say undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes. This relationship is seen within both parties. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, most of those who believe the majority of immigrants are in the U.S. legally (60%) think undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes than American citizens. Among Republicans who incorrectly think most immigrants are here illegally, 52% say undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes, compared with 38% who say they are not. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 86% of those who know most immigrants are here legally – compared with 71% of those who think they are here illegally – say that undocumented immigrants are not more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes. Since 2015, the share of Americans who say granting legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally is like “rewarding” them for wrongdoing has declined. Currently, 67% of Americans say they do not view granting legal status to immigrants in the U.S. illegally as a reward, while just 27% say it amounts to a reward to unauthorized immigrants for doing something wrong. In both 2015 and 2013, larger shares of the public (36% and 37%, respectively) said granting legal status to immigrants in this country illegally was like a reward for wrongdoing. Since 2013, the share of Democrats and Democratic leaners who say giving legal status to unauthorized immigrants is like rewarding them for doing something wrong has declined by 18 percentage points, from 28% to 10%. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 47% say providing legal status would be like rewarding them for doing something wrong; 55% said this in 2015, and 50% expressed this view five years ago. The share of Americans who express sympathy for immigrants in the U.S. illegally has remained fairly steady in recent years. Currently, 69% say they are very sympathetic (27%) or somewhat sympathetic (42%) toward immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Just 29% are very (14%) or somewhat (15%) unsympathetic toward them. While majorities across nearly all demographic groups have at least some sympathy for unauthorized immigrants, young people are more likely than older adults to express sympathy for them. And blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to have sympathy for people in the U.S. illegally. Republicans are divided: 48% say they are very or somewhat sympathetic toward unauthorized immigrants, while 49% say they are very or somewhat unsympathetic. Among Democrats, 86% are sympathetic and just 13% are unsympathetic. Over the past decade, opinions about levels of legal immigration into the United States have changed among members of both parties, especially among Democrats. Currently, 40% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say that legal immigration into the U.S. should be increased, 39% say it should be kept at its present level and 16% say it should be decreased. In 2006, just 20% of Democrats favored increasing the level of legal immigration into the U.S.; as recently as three years ago, 26% of Democrats favored this. Opinions have changed more modestly among Republicans: The share supporting decreasing the level of legal immigration has declined 10 percentage points since 2006 (from 43% to 33%), while the share favoring increased legal immigration has risen from 15% to 22%. Still, a larger share of Republicans currently support decreasing (33%) rather than increasing (22%) legal immigration into the U.S. (39% say it should be kept at its present level). Among Democrats, more than twice as many support increasing (40%) rather than decreasing (16%) legal immigration (39% of Democrats also want to keep it at its present level). Democrats are internally divided about legal immigration. Liberal Democrats are 19 percentage points more likely than moderate and conservative Democrats to support increasing legal immigration into the U.S. (50% vs. 31%). And while nearly half of Democrats under age 50 (47%) favor increasing legal immigration, 30% of those 50 and older say the same. Among Republicans as well, there are age differences in views of legal immigration. Among Republicans 50 and older, 39% support cutting back on legal immigration, compared with 27% of younger Republicans. In contrast with Democrats, however, there are no significant ideological differences among Republicans in these opinions. There also are educational differences in both parties in views of legal immigration. Nearly half of Democrats (49%) with at least a four-year college degree favor increasing legal immigration, compared with 35% who do not have a four-year degree. Among Republicans, those who do not have a college degree are somewhat more likely than those who do to favor cutting legal immigration into the U.S. (35% vs. 28%). Most people say that today’s immigrants are either about as willing to adapt (32%) or more willing to adapt (26%) to the American way of life compared with immigrants who came to the United States in the early 1900s. Fewer (36%) say today’s immigrants are less willing to adapt. Like other attitudes about immigrants and immigration, views on the willingness of immigrants to assimilate have grown more positive over the past decade, with the biggest change occurring among Democrats. The share of Democrats and Democratic leaners who say immigrants are less willing to adapt has declined from 38% to 17% since 2006. A larger share of Democrats (79%) say immigrants are about as willing to adapt or more willing to adapt than did so 12 years ago (56%). Conversely, a larger share of Republicans and Republican leaners (62%) say today’s immigrants are less willing to adapt than did so in 2006 (56%). Most Americans say they often (47%) or sometimes (27%) come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English. These views have not changed much since 2006, though in the 1990s fewer said they often interacted with immigrants who struggled to speak English (29% in 1993). Among those who often or sometimes have contact with immigrants who speak little or no English, fewer say this bothers them today (26%) than did so in 2006 (38%) or in the 1990s. Among Democrats who encounter immigrants who speak little or no English, the share saying they are not bothered by this has increased from 63% to 85% since 2006. About six-in-ten Republicans (59%) say they are not bothered; 52% said this 12 years ago.","Among Democrats who encounter immigrants who speak little or no English , the share saying they are not bothered by this has increased from 63 % to 85 % since 2006 .

Some 43% of Americans think major technology firms support the views of liberals over conservatives, while 33% believe these companies support the views of men over women, a new Pew Research Center survey finds. In addition, 72% of the public thinks it likely that social media platforms actively censor political views that those companies find objectionable. The belief that technology companies are politically biased and/or engaged in suppression of political speech is especially widespread among Republicans. Fully 85% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think it likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints, with 54% saying this is very likely. And a majority of Republicans (64%) think major technology companies as a whole support the views of liberals over conservatives. On a personal level, 74% of Americans say major technology companies and their products and services have had more of a positive than a negative impact on their own lives. And a slightly smaller majority of Americans (63%) think the impact of these companies on society as a whole has been more good than bad. At the same time, their responses highlight an undercurrent of public unease about the technology industry and its broader role in society. When presented with several statements that might describe these firms, a 65% majority of Americans feel the statement “they often fail to anticipate how their products and services will impact society” describes them well – while just 24% think these firms “do enough to protect the personal data of their users.” Meanwhile, a minority of Americans think these companies can be trusted to do the right thing just about always (3%) or most of the time (25%), and roughly half the public (51%) thinks they should be regulated more than they are now. These are among the key findings of this Pew Research Center survey, conducted May 29-June 11 among 4,594 U.S. adults. As technology companies have taken on an increasingly central role in the media landscape and broader economy, they have been drawn into a number of controversies relating to the perception that they actively support or promote certain viewpoints over others. For instance, social media sites and other online platforms have faced charges from conservative commentators and lawmakers that their platforms suppress or limit the reach of right-leaning viewpoints. And this survey finds that a substantial share of Americans – especially those with conservative political leanings – agree with these arguments. When asked about the political views that major technology companies support, fewer than half of Americans (43%) say these companies support the views of liberals and conservatives equally. Instead, a slight majority feels these companies support the views of one side of the partisan spectrum over the other: 43% of Americans say the companies support the views of liberals over conservatives, while 11% say they support the views of conservatives over liberals. The view that major technology companies are more supportive of certain political views is particularly widespread among Republicans. Some 64% of Republicans (including Republican-leaning independents) say major technology companies support the views of liberals over conservatives, and just 28% say these companies support the views of liberals and conservatives equally. By contrast, 28% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say these companies support liberal views over conservative ones, and 53% say both groups’ views are supported equally. Just 16% of Democrats say the companies support the views of conservatives over liberals. Along with companies’ perceived support of certain political viewpoints, roughly seven-in-ten Americans (72%) think it likely that social media companies intentionally censor political viewpoints that those companies find objectionable – with 35% saying they find this very likely. The vast majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (85%) think it likely that social media companies engage in this behavior, with 54% indicating they find it very likely. A smaller share of Democrats – though still a majority, at 62% – also think it likely that social media companies engage in this behavior. In interpreting these findings, it is important to note that the public does not find it inherently objectionable for online platforms to regulate certain types of speech. For example, a 2017 survey by the Center found that the vast majority of Americans think these platforms have a responsibility to step in when their users are engaging in harassing behavior. That same survey found that 53% of Americans think it is more important for people to feel welcome and safe online than it is for people to be able to speak their minds freely in digital spaces (although, notably, 45% say the opposite). Nonetheless, the view that social media platforms take steps to censor certain political viewpoints is one that is widespread among the public as a whole. When asked a separate question about whether major technology companies support the views of men or women, a majority of Americans (58%) say these companies support the views of men and women equally. One-third (33%) say the companies support the views of men over women, while 8% feel they support the views of women over men. Men and women differ somewhat in their perceptions of which gender’s values, if either, technology companies favor. Some 39% of women say these companies support the views of men more than women, while just 4% say they support women’s views more than those of men. Men, on the other hand, are less likely to say these companies support the views of men over women (26% express this view). In addition, men are three times as likely as women to say these companies support the views of women over those of men (12% of men express this opinion). However, majorities of both men (61%) and women (55%) say these companies support the views of men and women equally. Previous Pew Research Center surveys have found that Americans tend to be more broadly upbeat about the impact of technology on their own personal lives than they are about the impact of technology on society as a whole. And this survey finds continuing evidence of this trend in the specific context of public attitudes toward major technology companies. Roughly three-quarters of Americans (74%) think the impact of major technology companies on their own lives has been more good than bad, while 24% say the opposite. When asked about the broader societal impact, a majority of Americans continue to feel positively, but the share saying the good outweighs the bad falls to 63%. And 36% of Americans say the impact of these companies on society as a whole has on balance been more bad than good. In general there is relatively modest variation on these questions across demographic categories, but certain groups stand out somewhat in their views. Notably, Americans who have not graduated from college express somewhat more negative views about the impact these companies have had on their own lives, as well as on society as a whole. Some 17% of those with a college degree say the bad outweighs the good, compared with 28% among those who have not graduated from college. Similarly, 29% of college graduates describe the societal impact as more bad than good, as do 39% among Americans who have not graduated from college. Along with these differences by educational attainment, Republicans are somewhat more pessimistic than Democrats about the impact of these companies – especially their impact on society as a whole. Some 41% of Republicans and Republican leaners think these companies have had an impact on society that is more bad than good, compared with 32% of Democrats. Overall, the public expresses modest levels of trust in major technology companies to do what is right. Only 3% of Americans think these companies can be trusted to do what is right just about all of the time, notably smaller than the share (14%) that thinks they can hardly ever be trusted. In total, some 28% of Americans think these companies can be trusted to do the right thing most of the time or always, while a total of 72% think they can be trusted to do the right thing some of the time or hardly ever. Even so, a majority of Americans (69%) say these companies are no more or less ethical than companies in other industries. Around one-in-five (22%) think they are generally less ethical than companies in other industries, while 8% feel they are more ethical than others. Republicans and Republican leaners are around twice as likely as Democrats to say these companies are less ethical than others (30% vs. 16%). But a majority of Americans belonging to or leaning toward each party say major technology companies are about as ethical as companies in other industries. When asked about the appropriate role of government in regulating major technology companies, around half of U.S. adults (51%) believe these companies should be regulated more than they are now. Around one-in-ten (9%) feel they should be regulated less than they are now, while 38% say their current level of regulation is appropriate. Although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see an anti-conservative bias among major technology companies, this attitude does not translate into a broader desire by Republicans for increased regulation of these companies. Just over half (57%) of Democrats and Democratic leaners think major technology companies should be regulated more heavily than they are now, but that share falls to 44% among Republicans and Republican leaners. Indeed, 12% of Republicans say these companies should be regulated less than they are currently. That view is shared by 7% of Democrats. More broadly, the public places technology companies somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of their overall power in the economy relative to other industries and commercial entities. Asked about the relative clout of eight different groups or entities, just over half the public (55%) says technology companies have too much power and influence, similar to the share (57%) that thinks the energy industry has an outsize influence on the economy today. Larger shares of the public feel that pharmaceutical companies, advertisers, or banks and other financial institutions have too much power and influence today, while smaller shares think this is true of labor unions, small businesses or the farming and agriculture industry. Americans also are generally downbeat about the role and impact of tech firms when presented with statements about those firms. Majorities of Americans feel these companies create products and services that mostly benefit people who already have advantages in life (64% think this describes these companies well) and that they often fail to anticipate how their products and services will impact society (65%). At the same time, just 24% think these firms “do enough to protect users’ personal data” – and 75% feel this is not an accurate description of major technology companies. Although differing shares of older and younger adults adopt and use various technologies in their own lives, their views of the technology industry itself diverge in certain ways but align in others. On some of these issues, younger and older Americans express similar attitudes. For instance, they have comparable levels of trust in major technology firms to consistently do what is right; are equally likely to think that these companies support the views of a particular gender or political affiliation over others; and are equally likely to say the impact of these companies on society as a whole has been more good than bad. On other questions, there are more pronounced differences between the attitudes of older and younger Americans – with older adults typically taking a more broadly pessimistic view of these firms and their overall impact. For instance, larger shares of older adults think major technology companies often fail to anticipate how their products and services will impact society, that these companies have too much power and influence in today’s society, and that they should be regulated more than they are currently. And while sizable shares of both age groups think it likely that social media companies censor political speech that those companies find objectionable, that view is shared by a larger majority of older (81%) than younger (67%) adults.","Overall , the public expresses modest levels of trust in major technology companies to do what is right .

Overall, Africans, along with Asians and Latin Americans, tend to express more positive views about economic conditions than do Europeans and Middle Easterners. Similarly, optimism for the next generation is higher in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Since our first international poll in 2001, the Pew Research Center has surveyed 26 African nations, exploring how average citizens across the continent feel about the important issues in their countries and their own lives, as well as examining their perspectives on religion, international affairs, and other topics. The spring 2013 39-nation survey by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project included eight African countries: Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, and Uganda. Findings from the poll, which was conducted from March 2 to May 1, 2013, highlight the economic challenges facing these eight nations (see the Methodology Section of this report for more on how the poll was conducted). Many Africans continue to struggle financially, and in some countries, the share of the public who say they are sometimes unable to afford food is alarmingly high. And while inequality is considered a major problem across the globe, Africans are especially concerned about this issue. But, by many measures the economic outlook is far more grim in other parts of the world. In particular, most Middle Eastern and European publics surveyed offer overwhelmingly gloomy assessments of their economic situations – less than 5% describe economic conditions as good in Spain, Italy, and Greece – and in both regions there is relatively little optimism about the next generation’s economic prospects. In contrast, Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans tend to believe today’s children will be better off financially than their parents. When thinking about international affairs, Africans tend to worry about the same problems as others around the world – specifically, international financial instability, global climate change, and Islamic extremist groups top their list of concerns. Meanwhile, two major players on the world stage, the United States and China, are widely popular in Africa, although America’s image remains somewhat stronger than China’s in the region. The big exceptions are in Egypt and Tunisia, which have a decidedly negative view of the U.S. Below we highlight some of the key findings from the spring 2013 survey in Africa, and we compare our findings in Africa with those from other regions around the world. In the Appendix, we list several reports that include more extensive results for Africa and the other nations polled. This spring’s survey found varying assessments of national economic conditions in Africa. Among the eight African countries included in the study, South Africa and Kenya were the only two in which at least half said their economy was in good shape. Opinion was almost equally divided on this question in Senegal, while economic ratings were mostly negative in Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria. Two countries that have experienced considerable political upheaval over the last two and a half years, Egypt and Tunisia, offered the most negative assessments. Even though many in these eight nations are dissatisfied with their economic situations, the mood in the Middle East and Europe is worse. Across the African nations surveyed, a median of 41% believe the economy is in good shape, compared with 27% in the Middle East and just 15% in Europe. Overall, Latin American countries are slightly more positive than the African nations included in the study – a median of 44% describe their economic situation positively across the seven Latin American countries polled. Asia offers the most positive economic evaluations – a median of 52% give their economy a favorable assessment. However, this relatively positive median percentage is driven by high ratings in only four of the eight nations polled in the region: China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Australia. Views are largely negative in Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Pakistan. One striking finding from the survey is the pervasiveness of worries about inequality. In 31 of 39 nations, half or more say this is a very big problem in their country. The gap between rich and poor is an especially important challenge in Africa. In seven of eight African nations surveyed, at least seven-in-ten consider it a very big problem. Across these eight countries, a median of 76% hold this view, higher than any other region. However, inequality is a major concern in other regions as well. A median of 68% rate it a very big problem in Latin America, while 60% say the same in the Middle East. A median of 59% think inequality is a very big problem in Europe. Concerns are particularly strong in Greece, Italy, and Spain, three nations struggling with the ongoing effects of the euro crisis. The divide between rich and poor is less of a concern in Asia, although more than half describe it as a very big problem in Pakistan, South Korea, the Philippines, and China. Worries about inequality also are less prevalent in the United States and Canada. Still, nearly half in both countries think it is a very important issue. Levels of deprivation are relatively high in the African nations surveyed. Half or more report that there have been times in the last year when they have been unable to afford food for their families in Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Senegal. Somewhat fewer say this in Egypt and Tunisia. Overall, there is a strong correlation between the percentage of people in a country who say they have not been able to afford food at some point in the last year and that country’s per capita gross domestic product, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, or PPP. As one might expect, struggling to afford food is much less common in wealthier countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan, and Western European nations. The United States, however, has a higher percentage of people reporting difficulties buying food than its per capita income level would predict. Even though many in Africa struggle to afford life’s basic necessities, there is still considerable optimism about the future. A median of 50% believe children in their country today will be better off financially than their parents. Just 37% think children will be worse off. Optimism is especially widespread in Nigeria and Ghana, where nearly two-thirds say children will be better off. It is less common in Uganda and South Africa, where opinion is roughly divided between optimists and pessimists. Egypt is the least hopeful among the African nations studied – just 22% predict children will be better off than their parents. Some of the wealthiest nations in the world are among the least hopeful about prospects for the next generation. Pessimism is common throughout Western Europe, as well as in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan. Doubts about the future are also common in the Middle East. Once again, the most positive results are found in Asia and Latin America. China registers the greatest optimism on the survey, with 82% saying they believe today’s children will be better off than their parents. When asked about potential international threats to their country, people in these eight African nations tend to emphasize international financial instability, global climate change, and Islamic extremist groups. They are generally less worried about the other potential threats included on the survey – Iran’s nuclear program, North Korea’s nuclear program, political instability in Pakistan, America’s power and influence, and China’s power and influence. However, there are some exceptions to this pattern. For instance, 40% of South Africans rate China’s power and influence a major threat, making it the second highest rated concern there. And the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is the second highest rated concern among Egyptians. African views about international dangers mirror those found in other regions. Across the 39 nations surveyed, the top concerns were the broad global threats of financial instability, climate change, and extremism. There was generally less concern about the threats posed by specific countries such as Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, China, and the United States. The world’s two leading powers, the U.S. and China, enjoy mostly positive images in Africa. Both nations receive higher favorability ratings in Africa than in the other regions included in the 2013 survey. Across the eight African nations, a median of 73% express a positive opinion of the U.S., while 65% hold this view about China. Globally, the U.S. generally gets higher marks than China on this question. However, while America’s image is positive in most of the African nations polled, this is not the case in the North African countries of Egypt and Tunisia. Only 16% of Egyptians and 42% of Tunisians have a favorable view of the U.S. Ratings for the U.S. are also relatively low in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinian territories. The Middle East is the one region where China receives higher marks than the U.S. (although with a median favorability of 40%, China’s ratings are not especially high in the region either). Both globally and in Africa, the U.S. has a much stronger reputation than China on human rights issues. Across the countries from around the world included in the survey, a median of 70% believe the American government respects the personal freedoms of its people, while just 36% say this about China.1 Solid majorities in seven of the eight African nations think the U.S. respects individual liberty. The exception is Egypt, where 45% hold this view. Meanwhile, more than half in only four African nations – Nigeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Kenya – say the Chinese government respects the personal freedoms of its people. Since 2008 and the onset of the financial crisis, global perceptions of American economic power have been in decline, while ratings of Chinese economic power have been on the rise. But in Africa, the U.S. is still considered the world’s top economy. Senegalese, Kenyans, Ugandans, Nigerians, Ghanaians, and South Africans are significantly more likely to name the U.S., rather than China, as the world’s leading economic power. Egyptians and Tunisians, however, are more closely divided on this question. Africans clearly want a good relationship with the U.S., although positive relations with Beijing are also a priority. When asked whether it is more important for their country to have strong ties with the U.S. or China, the balance of opinion leans toward the U.S. in Uganda, Senegal, and Ghana, while Kenyans and South Africans are more divided. In Nigeria, 37% say a strong relationship with China is more important, compared with just 17% who say this about the U.S. (the question was not asked in Egypt or Tunisia). However, in all of these countries a sizeable minority volunteer that having strong ties with both is equally important, reflecting the view that both of these major powers can play a positive role in the continent’s future.","Africans clearly want a good relationship with the U.S. , although positive relations with Beijing are also a priority .

Almost all Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives stand with their party in support of abortion rights, while almost all Republicans reflect their party’s position against abortion rights. Yet the partisan divide among Americans themselves is less stark, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey. As is true on many other political issues, sizable minorities of Republicans and Democrats say they do not agree with the dominant position on abortion of the party they identify with or lean toward. And within each partisan coalition, some groups are less likely than others to agree with their party on abortion. Overall, roughly one-third of Americans who identify as Republican or as Republican-leaning independents do not agree with their party on abortion (35%), including 12% who say they agree with the Democratic Party on abortion and 23% who say they do not agree with either party. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, three-in-ten do not agree with their party on abortion, including 7% who say they agree with the GOP and 22% who say they don’t agree with either party. (The same 2019 survey found that roughly a fifth to a third of Americans don’t agree with their party on issues including policies to deal with the economy, health care and illegal immigration.) Younger Republicans are less likely to stand with their party on abortion, with 56% of Republicans under 50 saying they agree with the GOP, compared with 71% of those ages 50 and older. Republicans who are religiously unaffiliated also are less likely than other Republicans to agree with their party on abortion. And four-in-ten Republicans who identify as liberal or moderate (41%) say they agree with the GOP on abortion, about half the share of those who identify as conservative (81%). Among Democrats, 56% of those with a high school diploma or less education agree with their party on abortion, compared with 84% of college graduates who say this. In addition, roughly six-in-ten black (58%) and Hispanic (59%) Democrats support the party on abortion, compared with eight-in-ten white Democrats. And Democrats who identify as conservative or moderate also are much less likely to agree with their party than those who identify as liberal (57% vs. 85%). Those who live in the South (64%) or are affiliated with a religion also are less likely than other Democrats to agree with their party. Support for abortion rights has increased among Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party over the past decade. And during this year’s party primaries, some presidential candidates struck different notes on whether abortion opponents have a place in the party. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said “being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat,” while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said “pro-life Democrats … are part of our party, and I think we need to build a big tent.” Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee, has changed his views on abortion during his political career. While he has long supported Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling for a constitutional right to abortion in at least the first trimester, Biden also has often backed curbs on abortion. In 2006 he characterized himself as being “a little bit of an odd man out in my party” on the issue. President Donald Trump also has expressed different views on abortion over time. In 1999, vying for the Reform Party’s presidential candidacy, he characterized himself as “pro-choice in every respect.” This year, he became the first sitting president to attend the March for Life and told participants: “Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.” Another way to examine intraparty differences on abortion – especially since the official stances of both parties have evolved over time – is to see how people feel about whether it should be legal. Most Republicans and their leaners say abortion should be illegal (62%) in all or most cases, with a larger share saying it should be illegal in most cases (45%) than in all cases (17%). Republicans who live in the Northeast and those who identify as moderate or liberal are less likely than other Republicans to say abortion should be illegal in all cases. Democrats, for their part, are more unified in support of legal abortion than Republicans are against it, with 82% of Democrats saying abortion should be legal all or most of the time. But Democrats are roughly split on whether it should be legal in all cases (40%) or most cases (42%). Democrats who live in the South, those who are ages 65 and older, and those who identify as conservative or moderate are less likely than other Democrats to say abortion should be legal in all cases. Whether people hold an absolutist stance on abortion is tied to how strongly they support their party on the issue. For example, Republicans and GOP leaners who say abortion should be illegal in all cases are more likely to say they agree strongly with the GOP on abortion than to say they agree somewhat (73% vs. 9%). And Democrats and their leaners who say abortion should be legal in all cases also are more likely to say they agree strongly with their party than to say they agree only somewhat (70% vs. 11%).

Hispanic voters this year make up an even larger share of the state’s registered voters than in past years, but the profile of the Latino electorate has shifted over the past decade or so, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state voter registration data. Due to the state’s large Cuban voting bloc, the Latino vote had been reliably Republican. For example, President George W. Bush won both the Hispanic vote and the state in 2004. But 2008 represented a tipping point: More Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans, and the gap has only widened since then. This has led to the growing influence of Democrats among the state’s Hispanic voters in 2008 and 2012, two presidential elections in which Barack Obama carried both Hispanics and the state. At the same time, the number of Latino registered voters in Florida who indicate no party affiliation has also grown rapidly during this time, and by 2012 had surpassed Republican registrations. In 2014, 4.8 million Hispanics lived in Florida, making it the third-largest Hispanic population in the nation, behind California and Texas. It is also growing faster than Florida’s population. Today 24% of Floridians are Hispanic, up from 17% in 2000. Overall, 1.8 million Hispanics were registered to vote in Florida as of February 2016, according to the state’s Division of Elections. Among all Floridians, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in 2016. This is due in part to Hispanics, who accounted for 88% of growth in the number of registered Democrats between 2006 and 2016. During this time, the number of Hispanic registered voters increased by 61%, while the number of Hispanics identifying as Democrats increased by 83% and those having no party affiliation increased by 95%. The number of Hispanic Republican registered voters has grown too – but much more slowly (just 16%). As a result, among Hispanic registered voters in 2016, 678,000 were registered as Democrats, 610,000 indicated no party affiliation and 479,000 were registered as Republicans. (It’s worth noting that not all registered voters cast a ballot, and voter turnout has a large impact in swing states like Florida.) However, in Miami-Dade County – home to 46% of the nation’s Cuban-American population – Republicans still outnumber Democrats among Hispanic registered voters. In 2016, there were 260,000 Republicans and 213,000 Democrats, both decreases of about 5,000 from 2014. But even in this Cuban stronghold, statewide trends hold true. Among Hispanic registered voters between 2006 and 2016, the number of Democrats increased 62% while the number of Republican registered voters was flat. In Florida’s two other counties with large Latino populations – Broward (north of Miami) and Orange (Orlando) – Latino registered voters have leaned more Democratic than the state, but the trend toward more registering as Democrats or professing no party identification applies there as well. What’s behind these changes? On the one hand, the demographics of the state’s Hispanic population are growing more diverse. In 2014, Cubans made up a smaller share (31%) of Hispanic eligible voters – adult U.S. citizens – in Florida than they did in 1990 (46%). Meanwhile, over the same period, Puerto Ricans made up a larger share of the state’s Hispanic eligible voters, rising from 25% to 27%. These changes have been driven by the outmigration of Puerto Ricans from the island to central Florida and the movement of Puerto Rican-origin Hispanics in the northeast U.S. to central Florida. The share of Hispanic eligible voters of other ancestry (such as Mexico and South America) has also increased, from 29% then to 42% today. On the other, Cuban Americans and their politics are also changing. This group increasingly leans toward the Democratic Party as more are born in the U.S. In addition, due to an influx of Cuban immigrants since 1990, a sizable majority of Cuban Americans today say they have at least some common values with people living in Cuba.

The spill dominated the public’s consciousness. It was the story people were most likely to say they talked about with friends. The percentage following it very closely doubled from one week earlier and a large majority of Americans know where the crisis is unfolding. About four-in-ten (41%) say this was the story they followed most closely last week, much greater than the 21% that say they most closely followed news about Arizona’s controversial new law targeting illegal immigrants. When asked what story they were talking about with friends, 26% mention the Gulf Coast oil spill, while 12% offer the debate over the new Arizona immigration law, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted April 30-May 3 among 1,011 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Large percentages also have basic knowledge of these heavily covered stories. In a separate survey, 82% correctly named Louisiana as the state off of whose coast the disaster occurred. About as many (79%) chose Arizona when asked which state recently passed a law that gives police more authority to question people they suspect might be illegal immigrants. By contrast, just 44% identified Charlie Crist of Florida as the Republican governor who announced last week that he would run for a seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent. For its part, the media devoted the bulk of coverage last week to these stories and the economy. The oil spill and the immigration debate each made up 16% of the newshole analyzed by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. Meanwhile, economic news totaled 24% of coverage, with the largest shares devoted to coverage of Goldman Sachs and allegations of fraud against the company (9%), the debate over strengthening Wall Street regulation (6%) and the economic crisis in Greece (3% of newshole). Other economic news made up another 6% of coverage. More than four-in-ten Americans (44%) say they very closely followed news last week about the large amount of oil leaking into the waters off the Louisiana coast. A week earlier, just 21% said they were very closely following news about the off-shore oil rig explosion on April 20 that left 11 dead. That accident triggered the underwater oil release. This week’s number is the highest for an oil spill since May 4-7, 1989, when 52% said they were very closely following news about the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska late that March. Among partisans, Democrats are more likely to say they followed the current oil spill story very closely than Republicans (49% vs. 39%). Interest among independents falls in between (45%). The rapidly expanding spill also had people talking: 26% say this was the news they talked about with friends. No other story comes close. Just more than one-in-ten (12%) say they talked with friends about Arizona’s new law targeting illegal immigrants, 5% talked about sports or health care reform, while 4% each talked about the Times Square bomb scare – which took place on May 1 as the survey was in the field, crime or the weather. More than a third (36%) say they very closely followed news about Arizona’s new law giving police more authority to question people they suspect might be illegal immigrants. There are no significant differences among partisans. About two-in-ten (21%) say this was the news they followed most closely. Interest in the debate over immigration policies is up to its highest levels since mid-2006. That May, as lawmakers considered immigration legislation in Washington and protests were held by immigrants and supporters in several American cities, 44% said they following the issue very closely. About a third of the public (32%) says they followed news about the economy very closely last week, while 11% say this was the news they followed most closely. Americans also kept a close watch on several elements of the economic story. About two-in-ten (19%) say they followed proposals for stricter regulation of banks and financial institutions very closely; 2% say this was the news they followed most closely. Just fewer than two-in-ten (17%) say they followed news about the appearance of Goldman Sachs executives before Congress to face questioning about the company’s role in the economic crisis; 5% say this was the story they followed most closely. Just 6% say they followed news about the financial crisis in Greece very closely. This was the most closely followed story for 1%. In a separate survey conducted April 29-May 2, about eight-in-ten (82%) correctly choose Louisiana from four options as the state closest to the spill now threatening the coastline. A similar number (79%) know that it is Arizona that recently enacted the law dealing with when police can question people about their immigration status. Two-thirds (67%) know that Goldman Sachs is the Wall Street firm facing a fraud lawsuit brought by the government. Smaller numbers pick Greece from four European nations as the government facing a severe financial crisis (49%) or know that Florida’s Charlie Crist is the Republican governor who announced last week that he would run for the state’s open U.S. senate seat as an independent. About four-in-ten (41%) say they did not know or did not answer the Crist question, while 35% say they did not know on the Greece question. About three-in-ten (29%) got all five questions correct. As in previous Pew Research knowledge surveys, there are substantial demographic differences in awareness of facts about current stories. Even so, large majorities across all demographic categories identified Louisiana as the state near the oil spill and Arizona as state that recently passed the immigration law giving police greater powers. Goldman Sachs also is widely known as the firm being sued for fraud, although college graduates (89%) are far more likely than those with a high school education (47%) to know this. Differences among partisans are fairly small on the questions that most answered correctly, but they widen on the other two. Half of Republicans and nearly that many independents (47%) could name Crist as the independent Senate candidate from Florida, compared with 38% of Democrats. On the Greek financial crisis, 51% of Republicans and 55% of independents answered this question correctly, compared with 38% of Democrats. About seven-in-ten Americans have heard at least a little about actress Sandra Bullock’s plans to divorce her husband and her recent adoption of a baby boy: 31% say they have heard a lot about these developments and 40% say they have heard a little. Women are much more likely to say they have heard a lot about developments in the actress’s life than men (42% vs. 18%). Fewer than two-in-ten (17%) say they heard a lot about Crist’s announcement that he would run for Florida’s open seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent instead of as a Republican. About a third (34%) say they heard a little about this, while close to half (49%) say they had heard nothing at all. There was no significant difference among partisans in the numbers who say they heard a lot about this story. Few of those surveyed had heard much about the upcoming elections in Great Britain. Just 6% say they heard a lot about the elections, while 31% say they heard a little. More than six-in-ten (63%) say they heard nothing at all about this. The public also heard little about a large-scale brawl in the Ukrainian Parliament, widely viewed on television and the internet, that involved punching, hair pulling, egg throwing and smoke bombs. Just 5% say they heard a lot about the fight, 27% say they heard a little, but close to seven-in-ten (68%) say they heard nothing at all. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected April 26-May 2, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected April 30-May 3, from a nationally representative sample of 1,011 adults. A separate survey, conducted April 29-May 2 from a nationally representative sample of 1,009 adults, included the knowledge questions about recent news events. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, under the direction of Infogroup/ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). The sample is produced by ORC from data provided by Marketing Systems Group. Interviews are conducted in English. Data are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, region and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population survey. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the current survey, conducted April 30-May 3, 2010: An additional survey was conducted April 29-May 2, which included the five questions concerning knowledge of current events. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups for that survey: In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","As a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico spread toward the Louisiana coastline last week , the public focused on the unfolding story of a potential environmental disaster .

Nearly half (47%) say they followed news about Haiti more closely than any other story. Almost two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about the debate over health care reform most closely, while 14% say they most closely followed news about Republican Scott Brown’s win in the race for the late Democrat Ted Kennedy’s U.S. Senate seat. The public’s take on the chances that health care legislation will be enacted this year shifted dramatically after Brown’s Jan. 19 victory, which will end the Democrats’ effective control of 60 Senate seats and their ability to stop Republican filibusters. About two-thirds (67%) now say they do not think a health care reform bill will be passed into law this year, while 27% say they think it will, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted Jan. 22-25 among 1,010 adults nationwide by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. This is a reversal from the previous week’s News Interest Index survey when 57% said they thought legislation would pass this year, while 33% said it would not. The Haiti earthquake and the Massachusetts election also received the most news coverage last week, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. The earthquake aftermath accounted for 27% of the newshole, while Brown’s win – and its potential impact on President Obama’s agenda – made up 21% of coverage. Specific coverage of the health care debate made up just 5% of the newshole. While Democrats focused overwhelmingly on the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake (66% say it was the story they followed most closely), Republicans were more likely to divide their attention among the week’s top stories. More than a third (35%) say they followed news about the earthquake more closely than any other story, but close to a quarter (23%) say they followed the Massachusetts election most closely. Just 6% of Democrats say they followed the election for Kennedy’s seat more closely than any other story. Among independents, 42% say they followed Haiti news most closely, and 13% say they followed the Massachusetts vote most closely. Attention to the Massachusetts special election was not confined to the Northeast. Roughly equal numbers say they followed the election very closely in the Northeast (39%) and the West (40%), little different from the percentages of those who say they followed it very closely in the Midwest (35%) and the South (33%). Men and women were equally interested in the vote (37% vs. 35% very closely). And, in another sign that the public saw the election as significant, almost two-thirds (64%) say the media gave the heavily-reported story about the right amount of coverage. The percentage of Americans who say they think health care legislation will pass this year (27%) is at its lowest point since the question was first asked in early October 2009. The week of Oct. 9-12, the public was divided: 45% thought legislation would pass within the next year; 46% thought it would not. While two-thirds (67%) now say they do not think legislation will be enacted this year, that view is even greater among those who say they followed the special election in Massachusetts very closely. Among that group, 78% say they do not think legislation will pass this year; 17% think it will. Among those following the health care debate very closely, a comparable 73% now say they do not think legislation will pass; 23% say they think it will. That is a reversal from just one week earlier, when 63% of those following the debate very closely said they thought legislation would pass and 33% thought it would not. The expectation that health care legislation will pass in the next year is down sharply among all partisan groups. Currently just 17% of Republicans say legislation will pass, down from 47% one week earlier. Among independents, the percentage dropped to 22% from 59% and among Democrats it dropped from 64% to 42%. Nevertheless, Democrats remain most likely to say legislation will be enacted. Among the 79% who know that the Republican won the special election, seven-in-ten (72%) say they do not think legislation will pass, while 22% think it will. Among the 21% who do not know that the GOP candidate won what had been Ted Kennedy’s seat, about half (49%) say they do not think legislation will be enacted this year. About seven-in-ten Americans (69%) say the press devoted too much coverage to Conan O’Brien’s departure from The Tonight Show and Jay Leno’s return to that show. O’Brien hosted the show for the last time on Friday, Jan. 22. About one-in-five (21%) say the media devoted the right amount of coverage to this story. Far fewer people say any other story received too much coverage last week. About seven-in-ten (71%) say the earthquake and relief efforts in Haiti have gotten the right amount of coverage; 19% say they have gotten too much coverage. Almost two-thirds (64%) say the Massachusetts election got the right amount of coverage, while 16% say it got too much. About as many (15%) say the race received too little coverage. A plurality (49%) says the Supreme Court’s decision overturning campaign finance laws on corporations and unions paying for ads about political candidates was under-covered. Just 8% say this decision, which was announced on Thursday, Jan. 21, got too much media attention. Close to four-in-ten (38%) say the media gave too little coverage to the country’s economic conditions. A matching percentage (38%) says the same about the debate over health care reform. As Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address, more than half of Americans (55%) say their opinion of him has not changed in recent weeks, but one third (33%) say their opinion of Obama has grown less favorable recently. Just 8% say their opinion of the president has improved. This is the most negative balance of opinion since Obama became president. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected from Jan. 18-24, 2010, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected Jan. 22-25, 2010, from a nationally representative sample of 1,010 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 4 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

But many Christians also hold what are sometimes characterized as “New Age” beliefs – including belief in reincarnation, astrology, psychics and the presence of spiritual energy in physical objects like mountains or trees. Many Americans who are religiously unaffiliated also have these beliefs. Overall, roughly six-in-ten American adults accept at least one of these New Age beliefs. Specifically, four-in-ten believe in psychics and that spiritual energy can be found in physical objects, while somewhat smaller shares express belief in reincarnation (33%) and astrology (29%). But New Age beliefs are not necessarily replacing belief in traditional forms of religious beliefs or practices. While eight-in-ten Christians say they believe in God as described in the Bible, six-in-ten believe in one or more of the four New Age beliefs analyzed here, ranging from 47% of evangelical Protestants to roughly seven-in-ten Catholics and Protestants in the historically black tradition. Moreover, religiously unaffiliated Americans (those who say their religion is atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular”) are about as likely as Christians to hold New Age beliefs. However, atheists are much less likely to believe in any of the four New Age beliefs than agnostics and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular.” Just 22% of atheists believe in at least one of four New Age beliefs, compared with 56% of agnostics and eight-in-ten among those whose religion is “nothing in particular.” Americans who consider themselves to be spiritual but not religious also tend to accept at least one New Age belief. Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults in this category hold one or more New Age beliefs, including six-in-ten who believe spiritual energy can be located in physical things and 54% who believe in psychics. And among those who say they are religious and spiritual, 65% espouse at least one New Age belief. Americans who reject both the religious and spiritual labels also are more likely to reject New Age beliefs. Roughly three-in-ten or fewer in this group believe in psychics, reincarnation, astrology or that spiritual energy can be found in objects. And fewer than half (45%) affirm one or more of these beliefs. There also are gender, age and other demographic differences associated with New Age beliefs. For instance, just as women are more likely than men to identify with a religion and to engage in a number of religious practices, women also are more likely to hold New Age beliefs. Across all four measures – belief in psychics, reincarnation, astrology and that spiritual energy can be found in objects – larger shares of women than men subscribe to these beliefs. And overall, seven-in-ten women hold at least one New Age belief, compared to 55% of men. Also, adults under age 65, those who have not graduated from college, racial and ethnic minorities, and Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than others to hold to at least one New Age belief.","Americans who consider themselves to be spiritual but not religious also tend to accept at least one New Age belief .

Younger adults are leading the way in increased mobility, preferring laptops to desktops and using their cell phones for a variety of functions, including internet, email, music, games, and video. Among the findings: Additionally, about one in 11 (9%) adults do not own any of the devices we asked about, including 43% of adults age 75 and older. In terms of generations, Millennials are by far the most likely group not only to own most of the devices we asked about, but also to take advantage of a wider range of functions. For instance, while cell phones have become ubiquitous in American households, most cell phone owners only use two of the main non-voice functions on their phones: taking pictures and text messaging. Among Millennials, meanwhile, a majority use their phones also for going online, sending email, playing games, listening to music, and recording videos. However, Gen X is also very similar to Millennials in ownership of certain devices, such as game consoles. Members of Gen X are also more likely than Millennials to own a desktop computer. e-Book readers and tablet computers so far have not seen significant differences in ownership between generations, although members of the oldest generation (adults age 75 and older) are less likely than younger generations to own these devices. These findings are based on a survey of 3,001 American adults (ages 18 and older) conducted between August 9 and September 13, 2010. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish, and the survey included 1,000 cell phone interviews. (More information is availabe in the Methodology section.) In this chart, the dips in tech ownership registered in the September 2010 survey are mostly a result of the fact that Spanish interviews were added to the survey. Most of the Pew Internet surveys before 2010 were only conducted in English. The Project has added Spanish to this survey and that knocked down the overall tech-ownership numbers in some instances because respondents who wanted to be interviewed in Spanish were somewhat less likely than others to be tech non-users. This is part of a series of reports by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project exploring how different generations use technology (previous reports: 2010, 2009, 2006). All the generation labels used in these reports, with the exceptions of “Younger Boomers” and “Older Boomers,” are the names conventionalized by William Strauss and Neil Howe in their book, Generations: The History of America’s Future, 1584 to 2069 (Perennial, 1992). The Pew Internet Project’s “Generations” reports make the distinction between Younger Boomers and Older Boomers because enough research has been done to suggest that the two decades of Baby Boomers are different enough to merit being divided into distinct generational groups. The Pew Research Center recently published a series of reports that more closely examined the values, attitudes and experiences of the Millennial generation.1 These reports are available in full at pewresearch.org/millennials. Many of these reports also compare this younger generation to older cohorts. The primary adult data in this report come from a Pew Internet Project survey conducted from August 9-September 13, 2010, with some data from a survey conducted April 29 to May 30, 2010. For more information about these surveys, please see the Methodology section at the end of this report. Eighty-five percent of Americans age 18 and older own a cell phone, making it by far the most popular device among adults. Mobile phones are especially popular with adults under the age of 66, although the largest drop-off is for adults in the oldest generation (those age 75 and older), of whom 48% own a cell phone. When asked further about the presence of mobile phones in their households, one-third (33%) of those who do not own a cell phone live in a household with at least one working mobile phone. This means that overall, 90% of all adults—including 62% of those age 75 and older—live in a household with at least one working cell phone. As the proportion of households with at least one working cell phone rises, many are doing without a landline phone connection at all. In the first half of 2010, roughly one in four (25%) American adults lived in households that were “wireless only” in that they had at least one cell phone, but no landline. This includes more than half (51%) of young adults ages 25-29.2 Though cell phones are now ubiquitous in American homes, the level of engagement with the phones does vary widely between generations. As shown in the above table, our May 2010 survey found that while roughly the same proportion of adults in the Millennial generation and Generation X own cell phones, Millennials are significantly more likely to use their phones for a variety of purposes. A majority of Millennials use their phones for taking photos, texting, going online, sending email, playing games, listening to music, and recording videos—making them significantly more likely than any other generation to engage in all of these activities. In fact, the only two activities that are widely popular for all cell phone owners are taking pictures and sending text messages. Taking pictures is the most popular function on Americans’ phones, with more than half of all cell phone owners under the age of 75 using their phones for this purpose (only 16% of adults age 75 and older take photos with their phones). Text messaging, though also widely adopted, is less popular with adults over age 56. Click here for a larger verison As noted in previous reports, desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006, as laptops have gained in popularity.3 Currently 59% of all adults own a desktop computer, and 52% own a laptop (76% own a computer overall). Millennials are the only generation that is more likely to own a laptop or netbook (70%) than a desktop computer (57%). While 69% of adults in Generation X own a desktop, a close 61% own a laptop. While roughly six in ten adults ages 47-65 own a desktop, only 49% of Younger Boomers and 43% of Older Boomers own a laptop. Only 45% of adults over age 65 have a computer of any kind (40% of adults in that age group use the internet), and they are increasingly likely to use a desktop: 28% of adults age 75 and older use a desktop, and 10% use a laptop.4 Almost half—47%—of adults own an iPod or other mp3 player. However, among the devices examined in this report, mp3 players saw the widest range in ownership rates between generations. While 74% of Millennials own an mp3 player, only 56% of members of Gen X do—and adoption rates continue to drop for each of the older generations. Only 3% of adults age 75 and older own this type of device. Overall, 42% percent of all adults age 18 and older own a game console, and it is especially popular with members of the Millennial Generation and Generation X. Sixty-three percent of all adults ages 18-46 own a game console like an Xbox or Play Station, as well as 38% of those ages 47-56. Ownership rates continue to drop off, to 19% of Older Boomers (ages 56-64), 8% of the Silent Generation (ages 66-74), and only 3% of the G.I. Generation (age 75 and older). Additionally, as previously reported in “Americans and Their Gadgets,” parents with children living at home are nearly twice as likely as non-parents to own a game console—64% of parents own one, vs 33% of non-parents.5 As of September 2010, 5% of American adults own an electronic book reader such as a Kindle or Sony Digital Book, up from 2% of adults the first time the question was asked in April 2009. Statistically, there is very little variation between the different generations, although the G.I. Generation is slightly less likely than younger generations to own such a device. Though age is not a strong predictor of e-book use, our previous “Gadgets” report noted that ownership is more likely among college graduates and those with relatively high household incomes.6 Though there have been several incarnations of tablet-like computers over the years,7 they had not gained widespread attention until Apple introduced the iPad in early 2010.8 As of September 2010, 4% of American adults own a tablet computer such as an iPad. Though education and household income are high predictors for owning a tablet computer, as with e-book readers, they are also more popular with adults age 56 and under (who are significantly more likely to own a tablet computer than adults age 66 and older). In a previous May 2010 survey, when 3% of all adults said they owned a tablet computer, roughly six in ten of tablet owners said they use their device to access the internet. However, given the small number of tablet owners these findings are not reported in detail here.9 Click for a larger version","Overall , 42 % percent of all adults age 18 and older own a game console , and it is especially popular with members of the Millennial Generation and Generation X.

On one side of the debate is what might be called the privacy-is-dead camp. Its adherents take the view that if people are willing to share all manner of personal details about their lives on social networking sites — their physical location, photos of their children, intimate accounts of personal struggles and triumphs — then surely they must have abandoned any reasonable expectation of privacy. Some researchers have suggested that social network users are uniquely unconcerned about privacy; that over time, regular use of social media without any major negative experiences may lessen their concerns about sharing information. Other threads of the privacy-is-dead argument point to the relative ease with which people’s digital footprints and physical whereabouts can now be tracked and the great lengths to which someone must go to protect their anonymity online — or offline. On the other side, some advocates and scholars argue that the public still cares deeply about their privacy online but those sensitivities have been ill-served by technology companies that stand to profit from more widespread sharing and availability of personal information. Users may be more open with what they share because they don’t adequately understand enough about how their data is stored and used. And just because they are comfortable posting some information publicly does not mean they have quietly surrendered all control over the information they choose to share online. Yet, social science researchers have long noted a major disconnect in attitudes and practices around information privacy online. When asked, people say that privacy is important to them; when observed, people’s actions seem to suggest otherwise. “Privacy” has become a powerful keyword, a shorthand tag that gets used to reference a constellation of public attitudes, technical affordances and legal arguments. Yet, the concept is so laden with multiple meanings that any use of the term begs for added specificity and context.1 This report addresses several questions about the privacy settings people choose for their social networking profiles, and provides new data about the specific steps users take to control the flow of information to different people within their networks. Because Facebook is by far the most popular social networking platform and the language of “privacy settings” is part and parcel of the Facebook experience, the term “privacy” is used throughout this report to refer to the choices users make to restrict the information they share through their profile.2 Social network users are becoming more active in pruning and managing their accounts. Women and younger users tend to unfriend more than others. About two-thirds of internet users use social networking sites (SNS) and all the major metrics for profile management are up, compared to 2009: 63% of them have deleted people from their “friends” lists, up from 56% in 2009; 44% have deleted comments made by others on their profile; and 37% have removed their names from photos that were tagged to identify them. Some 67% of women who maintain a profile say they have deleted people from their network, compared with 58% of men. Likewise, young adults are more active unfrienders when compared with older users. A majority of social network site users – 58% – restrict access to their profiles and women are significantly more likely to choose private settings. More than half of social networking site users (58%) say their main profile is set to private so that only friends can see it; 19% set their profile to partially private so that friends of friends can view it; and 20% say their main profile is set to be completely public. Women who use SNS are more likely than men to set the highest restrictions (67% vs. 48%). Half of SNS users say they have some difficulty in managing privacy controls, but just 2% say it is “very difficult” to use the controls. Those with the most education report the most trouble. In all, 48% of social media users report some level of difficulty in managing the privacy controls on their profile, while 49% say that it is “not difficult at all.” Very few users (2%) describe their experiences as “very difficult,” while 16% say they are “somewhat difficult” and another 30% say the controls are “not too difficult” to manage. Social media users who are college graduates are significantly more likely than those with lower levels of education to say that they experience some difficulty in managing the privacy controls on their profiles. 11% of SNS users have posted content they regret. Male profile owners are almost twice as likely as female profile owners to profess regret for posting content (15% vs. 8%). Young adults are also more prone to say they regret some of their social media postings; 15% of profile owners ages 18-29 say they have posted content they later regret, compared with just 5% of profile owners ages 50 and older.","About two - thirds of internet users use social networking sites ( SNS ) and all the major metrics for profile management are up , compared to 2009 : 63 % of them have deleted people from their “ friends ” lists , up from 56 % in 2009 ; 44 % have deleted comments made by others on their profile ; and 37 % have removed their names from photos that were tagged to identify them .","Explain the rise of concern in privacy reputation management on social media?","About two - thirds of internet users use social networking sites ) and all the major metrics for profile management are up , compared to 2009 : 63 % of them have deleted people from their “ friends ” lists , up from 56 % in 2009 ; 44 % have deleted comments made by others on their profile ; and 37 % have removed their names from photos that were tagged to identify them","About two - thirds of internet users use social networking sites ) and all the major metrics for profile management are up , compared to 2009 : 63 % of them have deleted people from their “ friends ” lists , up from 56 % in 2009 ; 44 % have deleted comments made by others on their profile ; and 37 % have removed their names from photos that were tagged to identify them"],"1873":["1873.png","Global views of Trump's characteristics % saying they think of President Donald Trump as","Since Pew Research Center conducted its first Global Attitudes survey in 2002, we have explored how the world sees the United States. This year’s survey finds negative reactions around much of the world to Donald Trump’s presidency, and major changes in ratings for the U.S. Here are nine charts that highlight international perceptions of Trump. 1Globally, Trump is much less popular than his predecessor. Across 37 countries we surveyed in spring 2017, a median of just 22% said they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. In contrast, 64% expressed confidence in President Barack Obama in these same 37 nations during the final years of his presidency. And this shift in American leadership has clearly had an impact on how the world sees the U.S.: A median of 49% now give the U.S. a favorable rating, down from 64% in the Obama era. 2Only a few countries have positive views of Trump. In just eight of the 37 nations in the study, roughly half or more say they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. The president gets his best reviews in the Philippines, where 69% express trust in him (although this is down from the 94% Obama registered in 2015). Trump also gets mostly positive ratings in sub-Saharan Africa, as did both Obama and former President George W. Bush. Russia, Israel and Vietnam also have confidence in Trump’s ability to handle international relations. 3Trump’s ratings in Western Europe look a lot like Bush’s at the end of his tenure. While Obama was very popular in Western Europe, his presidency was bookended by two very unpopular Republican presidents. Major elements of George W. Bush’s foreign policies met with widespread opposition in the region, and by the time he left office, his ratings in countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain were quite low. Today, Trump gets similar marks as Bush in these four nations. 4Europeans who favor right-wing parties are generally more likely to have confidence in Trump. Those with a favorable view of right-wing parties in France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany tend to express more confidence in Trump. For example, in France, 39% of people with a positive view of Marine Le Pen’s National Front party have confidence in the U.S. president, compared with just 6% among those who have an unfavorable opinion of the National Front. Still, even among those who like right-wing parties, confidence in Trump is limited, and there is no Western European country in which a majority of right-wing party supporters offer a positive assessment of the American president’s leadership in world affairs. 5Trump gets more negative ratings globally than Merkel, Xi or Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the only world leader included in the survey who receives more positive than negative reviews. Across the 37 nations polled, a median of 42% express confidence in her, while 31% say they lack confidence. Ratings for Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are mostly negative, and Trump receives even more unfavorable assessments than both of them. 6Global publics oppose some of Trump’s major policies. We tested five of Trump’s major national security and foreign policy proposals – withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, placing tighter restrictions on people entering the U.S. from certain majority-Muslim nations, pulling out of international climate change agreements, withdrawing from trade deals and building a wall on the Mexican border – and with a few exceptions, they meet with broad disapproval around the world. 7Most say Trump is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, but a majority also sees him as a strong leader. Survey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics and asked whether each one describes Trump. Around the globe, people tend to associate the American leader with all of the negative characteristics tested: Most say he is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, while relatively few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people. Describing Trump as charismatic is more common, though global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic, either. They do, however, see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55% across the nations polled describe him this way. 8Trump gets his lowest ratings in Mexico. Over the past decade, U.S. presidents have gotten mixed or negative reviews in Mexico, but at 5%, Trump registers the lowest confidence rating of any U.S. leader in Mexico since Pew Research Center began surveying there. His rating in Mexico is also the lowest among the 37 nations polled in 2017. The proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high-profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president, and more than nine-in-ten Mexicans oppose it. U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico, and that remains the case this year – though the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015. 9Russians give Trump higher marks than they gave Obama or Bush. Amid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. and its president have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russians’ ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 – the last time the Center polled in Russia – favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common, and Trump gets better reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.","Most say Trump is arrogant , intolerant and dangerous , but a majority also sees him as a strong leader .

At the same time, majorities of police officers and the public favor the use of body cameras, favor relaxing some restrictions on marijuana, and believe that long-standing bias against police was at least some of the motivation for the protests that followed many of the deaths of blacks during encounters with police in recent years. The contrasting views and notable similarities between the attitudes of police and the public emerge from two Pew Research Center surveys. One was of 7,917 sworn police officers from departments with at least 100 officers conducted online last May to August by the National Police Research Platform, and the other was of 4,538 adults conducted by mail and online last August to September. The surveys included a number of identically worded questions, which allowed for direct comparisons of the views of officers and the public on a range of issues. Among the more striking takeaways from these surveys was the very different way the police and the public view the deaths of blacks during encounters with police. Two-thirds of officers (67%) view these fatal encounters as isolated incidents, a view shared by only about four-in-ten Americans (39%). The public and police diverge on a range of other issues, sometimes by even larger margins. For example, when it comes to the work police do day in and day out, 83% of Americans say they understand the risks and challenges that police face. Roughly the same share of police (86%), in a similarly worded question, say they believe the public does not understand the risks officers face on the job. This is among the largest gaps between police and the public found in these surveys. One example of this disconnect: More than eight-in-ten Americans (83%) believe the typical officer has fired his or her weapon at least once in their career. By contrast, about a quarter (27%) of officers say they have done so. Other differences were not quite so large. About two-thirds of all Americans (64%) favor a ban on assault-style weapons and roughly the same share of police (67%) oppose such a restriction. More broadly, the surveys found that a larger share of police than the public believe it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns than to control gun ownership (74% of police vs. 53% of the public). The views of police and the public also differ sharply on whether the country has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites. A lopsided majority of officers (80%) say the country has made the necessary changes. But the public is more divided: 48% say the needed changes have been made while 50% believe that more changes are needed to assure equal rights for black Americans. Underlying the police views on this question is a substantial difference between black and white police officers – a difference that is, in fact, larger than the gap between the public and police. About nine-in-ten white officers (92%) but only 29% of black officers say the needed changes have already been made (though black officers are about twice as likely as blacks overall to hold this view). When it comes to the similarities between the police and the public, the surveys found that majorities of both groups favor the use of body cameras to record police interactions with citizens, though there was still a sizable difference in views on this question (66% of police versus 93% of the public). The police are also less likely than the public to believe body cameras would change the behavior of officers: Half of all officers say body cameras would make officers more likely to act appropriately, compared with 66% of all adults. Large majorities of police (68%) and the public (84%) also support easing some legal restrictions on marijuana, though the public is more likely than officers to support the legalization of marijuana for both personal and medical use (49% vs. 32%). While officers and the public differ on a ban on assault-style weapons, the views of both groups are closely aligned on other gun-control measures. For example, more than nine-in-ten officers (95%) and close to the same share of the public (87%) favor laws that would prevent the mentally ill from purchasing guns. About the same proportions of the police and the public favor background checks for people who buy firearms at a gun show or from a private individual (88% and 86%, respectively). A majority of police and a larger share of the public also support the creation of a federal database to track gun sales (61% and 71%, respectively). And while police and the public draw different lessons from the recent fatal encounters between blacks and police, the two groups broadly agree that long-standing anti-police bias was at least some of the motivation behind the demonstrations that followed many of these incidents (92% for police and a smaller but still substantial majority of 79% for the public). Police are also more likely than the public to say anti-police views were “a great deal” of the reason behind the demonstrations (68% vs. 41%). Other survey measures underscore the differences between police work and the typical job. For starters, these surveys suggest police view their jobs as more dangerous: Police officers are three times as likely as workers overall to say they nearly always or often have serious concerns about their physical safety while on the job (42% vs. 14%). Officers also are more likely than employed Americans overall to say their jobs frequently make them feel frustrated, and they are somewhat less likely to say they feel fulfilled by their work. About half (51%) of officers say their job nearly always or often frustrates them, compared with 29% of all workers. About four-in-ten officers (42%) say their work leaves them feeling fulfilled, compared with 52% of all workers.","The views of police and the public also differ sharply on whether the country has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites .

A quarter of the public (25%) says they followed news about the election outcome more closely than any other major news. Nearly as many (20%) say they followed news about the still-struggling economy most closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Nov. 11-14 among 1,001 adults. The public’s perceptions of economic news remain mixed, but are far less positive than earlier this year. Roughly half (53%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy; 41% say they are hearing mostly bad news while just 5% say they are hearing mostly good news. Those numbers have changed little since July, when perceptions of economic news took a turn for the worse. A month before that, nearly two-thirds (65%) said economic news was mix of good and bad and 30% said it was mostly bad. There continue to be wide partisan differences in views of economic news. About two-thirds of Democrats (66%) describe economic news as a mix of good and bad, compared with 49% of independents and 45% of Republicans. More than half of Republicans (53%) say the news about the economy has been mostly bad, as do 44% of independents and just 26% of Democrats. Very few people (5%) continue to say the recent economic news has been mostly good. Since December 2008, the proportion saying economic news is mostly good has remained below 10%, with the exception of one survey in August 2009 (11% mostly good). In the current survey, just 6% of Democrats, 5% of independents and 1% of Republicans say the news has been mostly good. Perceptions of economic news are about the same among those who follow this news very closely and those who follow it less closely. About half in each group say the news is a mix of good and bad (54% less closely, 51% very closely). While the public tracked news about the midterm elections and the economy most closely last week, there was no dominant story for the media: 12% of coverage was devoted to the election outcomes, while 9% was focused on the economy and an identical percentage on President Obama’s trip to Asia, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). A week earlier, which included Election Day, Nov. 2, 57% of coverage was devoted to the elections, making it one of the biggest stories since the presidential elections two years earlier. News about the Carnival Cruise ship stranded off the coast of Mexico without power for several days accounted for 4% of the newshole, but 15% of the public say this was the news they followed most closely last week. Women were more likely to follow this story very closely than men (18% vs. 12%). More than one-in-five (22%) of those 50 and older say they followed this news very closely, compared with 10% of those 18 to 49. Nearly two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about President Obama’s trip to Asia very closely; 7% say this was the news they followed most closely. In early April 2009, shortly after Obama took office, 25% said they very closely followed news about his first European trip and meetings with world leaders; 22% said the trip was the news they followed most closely that week. Just 13% say they very closely followed news last week about the publication of George W. Bush’s book about his life; 5% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the new book, “Decision Points,” made up 4% of coverage measured by PEJ. About a quarter of Republicans (24%) say they followed news about the book very closely, compared with 9% of Democrats and 10% of independents. Another 15% say they followed news about proposals to reduce the federal deficit unveiled by the leaders of a presidential panel; 2% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the proposals accounted for 7% of coverage. There were no significant differences among partisans in the numbers tracking this news very closely. Most Americans say they heard at least a little last week about the graphic warning labels for cigarette packages proposed by the Food and Drug Administration as another means to discourage smoking. Close to two-in-ten (17%) say they heard a lot about this and 38% heard a little; 44% say they heard nothing at all. Similar numbers heard at least a little about the video taken off the coast of Southern California of what some thought showed a mysterious missile trail in the sky (18% a lot, 39% a little). More than four-in-ten (42%) say they heard nothing at all about the video, which experts now say likely showed the condensation trail from an aircraft. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected November 8-14, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected November 11-14, from a nationally representative sample of 1,001 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Thursday through Sunday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for this survey are based on telephone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a national sample of 1,001 adults living in the continental United States, 18 years of age or older, from November 11-14, 2010 (670 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 331 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 136 who had no landline telephone). Both the landline and cell phone samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample is also weighted to match current patterns of telephone status based on extrapolations from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","The public ’s perceptions of economic news remain mixed , but are far less positive than earlier this year .

The federal government approved nearly 700,000 OPT applications in fiscal years 2008 through 2014, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data received through a Freedom of Information Act request. Data suggest that the total number of foreign graduates using OPT may continue to increase in subsequent years: More than 1 million foreign students studied at U.S. higher educational institutions in the 2015-16 school year, a record high. U.S. college graduates with F-1 visas for foreign students may apply to OPT, and those approved may work in the U.S. for up to 12 months in their field of study. Foreign students majoring in a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field may work in the U.S. for longer – up to 36 months. Unlike other U.S. visa programs, OPT has no cap on the number of foreign graduates who can participate. OPT is not subject to congressional oversight, though the program, which was created in 1947, can be changed by a U.S. president. Here are some key facts about foreign college graduates working in the U.S. under the Optional Practical Training program. 1The annual number of OPT approvals rose from 28,497 in fiscal 2008 to 136,617 in fiscal 2014, a nearly fivefold increase. This growth happened after the Bush administration in 2008 extended the amount of time STEM graduates may work in the U.S. to a maximum of 29 months. About half of STEM graduates have extended their OPT program beyond the initial 12-month period in recent years. In 2016, the Obama administration again expanded the work period for STEM graduates to its current 36-month maximum. 2Nearly as many people are approved for the OPT program as receive H-1B visas, another main source of high-skilled foreign workers who work in the U.S. on a temporary basis. From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, 768,214 H-1B visas were awarded, compared with 696,914 OPT approvals. Many of those working in the U.S. under the OPT program go on to apply for H-1B visas to stay longer in the U.S. 3STEM graduates made up nearly half (49%) of all those who were approved for OPT and were seeking employment in calendar years 2012 through 2015. STEM degrees accounted for six-in-ten of the most numerous majors among OPT approvals, with the remaining four in business-related fields. The three most common majors during this period were business administration and management (37,289), electrical and electronics engineering (26,873) and computer science (25,471). 4Those with STEM majors had a higher employment rate (73%) than non-STEM majors (57%) in the OPT program from 2012 to 2015. Among the 10 most numerous majors, computer engineering (76%), mechanical engineering (75%), and electrical and electronics engineering (75%) had the highest employment rates. 5Foreign students from India (72,151) and China (68,847) accounted for more than half (57%) of all those who were approved for OPT and found jobs from 2012 to 2015. Other top countries included South Korea (14,242), Taiwan (7,032) and Nepal (5,309). 6Graduates in STEM fields accounted for at least 70% of OPT approvals from India, Iran, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka from 2012 to 2015. Of the 72,151 from India employed under OPT, 84% had STEM degrees, the highest percentage of any origin country. Iran (79%), Bangladesh (74%) and Sri Lanka (70%) also had high shares of STEM graduates. Among those from China, 54% went to STEM graduates. 7Just 4% of those employed under the OPT program from 2012 to 2015 worked at the 10 largest tech companies in the Fortune 500. Amazon (1,936), Intel (1,563), Qualcomm (1,080) and Microsoft (1,067) employed the most workers under the OPT program. The 10 largest financial services companies hired fewer workers, with JP Morgan Chase (725), Bank of America (247) and Citigroup (205) among the top employers. 8The 10 universities with the most OPT approvals accounted for 13% of all program participants seeking employment from 2012 to 2015. The University of Southern California (7,485 participants), Columbia University (7,116) and New York University (5,260) graduated the most students in the program.

Older Americans are more likely than younger adults to feel their own health is at risk, while younger people are more focused on potential economic threats. Overall, larger shares of U.S. adults view the COVID-19 outbreak as a major threat to the nation’s economy (88%) and the health of the U.S. population as a whole (66%) than to their own finances (49%) and health (36%). Across each of these areas, concerns about the outbreak have increased significantly since mid-March. The survey, conducted March 19-24, finds that a quarter of adults say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to their personal health and finances. About as many (24%) say it is a major threat to their finances, but not to their health. Fewer Americans (11%) view the outbreak as a major threat to their health, but not their finances. However, 40% say it is not a major threat either to their health or their finances. Compared with older age groups, younger Americans are more likely to say that the COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to their personal financial situation but not a major threat to their personal health. Just 6% of those under age 30 say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to their personal health and not a major threat to their finances. By comparison, about a third (32%) say it is a major threat to their finances and not their health. Another 21% say it is a major threat to both their finances and health, while 41% do not view the outbreak as a major threat to either. The pattern is similar among the next oldest age groups; significantly more people in their 30s through 50s say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to their finances and not their health than say the opposite. But those 70 and older are about four times as likely as the youngest adults (those ages 18 to 29) to say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to their health but not their finances (25% vs. 6%). Aside from age differences, there also are partisan differences in views of the threats from the coronavirus outbreak. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say that the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to both their personal health and their own financial situation. About three-in-ten Democrats (29%) say that COVID-19 is a major threat to their own health and their finances compared with 19% of Republicans who feel the same way. Nearly half of Republicans (47%) say it is not a major threat to either their personal financial situation or their own health; only about a third of Democrats (35%) say the same. When it comes to how comfortable people feel with engaging in social activities during the coronavirus outbreak, the March 19-24 survey, fielded as many states were escalating their response to the outbreak, revealed differences by partisanship, gender and age. Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to say they would be comfortable engaging in several activities; for example, while 29% of Republicans and GOP leaners say they would be comfortable eating out in a restaurant, 16% of Democrats (including leaners) say the same. Larger shares of Republican men than women say they would be comfortable eating in a restaurant, and this is the case among Republicans under age 50 as well as older Republicans. Gender differences are more modest among Democrats. Looking at age differences among partisans, younger Republicans are particularly likely to express comfort with attending a crowded party. This is especially evident among younger, Republican men. About one-in-five Republican men ages 18 to 49 (18%) say they would be comfortable attending a crowded party, which is larger than the shares of older Republicans – or Democrats in any age group – who say that. Gender gaps are also seen across the set of activities asked about, with men substantially more likely than women to say they would feel comfortable taking part in a variety of activities during the outbreak. Republicans and men expressed more willingness to engage in every activity included in the survey compared with Democrats and women. Even after accounting for differences in the kinds of places Republicans and Democrats live (for example, whether they live in an urban, rural or suburban place and how much their state had been impacted so far by the coronavirus outbreak) and other demographic differences associated with partisanship (age, race and ethnicity, education, and sex), partisan differences remain among the biggest divides in willingness to engage in all of the activities asked about.

Auxier, Research Assistant, Pew Research Center The first hour of Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate, the last before Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, was dominated by talk of the economy. Perhaps in recognition of the debate’s venue in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, moderator Anderson Cooper invoked the former president during the first question of the night, repeating Reagan’s own famous debate question, “Are Americans better off than they were eight years ago?” While the two current front-runners for the GOP nomination, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, admitted that there were problems with the economy, neither would endorse the idea that American was worse off economically after eight years of the Bush administration. “[T]his president did pull us out of a deep recession. He put in place two tax cuts, which did get the — your country out of a recession and helped rebuild the country,” said Romney. “I think we are better off overall, if you look at the entire eight-year period, when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created, the improvement in the economy, et cetera,” said McCain. While there is a sizable partisan gap in ratings of the national economy, even among Republicans fewer than half view economic conditions with favor. Currently, 46% of Republicans, and just 24% of independents and 15% of Democrats, give the economy at least a good rating. “I don’t think we are,” said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, disagreeing with the front-runners on the state of the economy. “They’re hurting because they’re not making a lot more money to haul something, but they’re spending a lot more money to get it done. And all over our economy with the unemployment up to 5 percent across the nation that means there are a lot of families today that don’t have a paycheck, and if you don’t have a paycheck, it’s hard to put groceries on the table and it’s hard to pay the rent.” Huckabee’s opinion mirrors growing economic concerns among moderate Republicans who have grown increasingly sour about the current state of the economy. Over the past four years, conservative Republicans have consistently been more positive about the economy than their moderate and liberal counterparts, but the size of this gap has grown. Currently just 29% of moderate-to-liberal Republicans rate the economy positively; by contrast, a small majority of conservative Republicans (54%) still do so. The economic discussion is a reflection of the emergence of the economy as the most important issue in 2008. Roughly one-in-three Americans (34%) cite economic problems as the nation’s most grave concern, compared with 27% who say the war in Iraq is the biggest problem facing the nation. A year ago the reverse was true with 42% citing Iraq as the most important problem in the wake of Bush’s proposal to increase the number of troops there. The relative importance of economic problems has risen substantially in recent months. In September, the number of Americans citing Iraq as the nation’s biggest problem was nearly twice the number who cited economic problems (37% vs. 20%). Among Republicans, 27% currently see the economy as the most important problem facing the nation, compared with 21% who cite Iraq. Tax cuts were a major point of contention between McCain and Romney. When Romney was asked why he had claimed McCain would follow a “liberal Democratic course” as president, Romney observed that McCain had twice voted against Bush’s tax cuts. McCain responded with his own accusation about Romney’s tax cutting bona fides. “As I understand it, his record was that he raised taxes by $730 million,” said McCain. The senator also twice mentioned the need to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for the sake of the economy. According to an analysis by nytimes.com, the word “tax” was uttered by the candidates and moderators 26 times while “taxes” was mentioned 12 times.1 Making the income tax cuts permanent was last on a list of 21 public priorities for the president and Congress for 2008 according to a January Pew survey, with Republicans (44%) viewing it as more of a priority than Democrats (37%).

The national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted May 12-18 among 2,002 adults, finds that 58% approve of the U.S. conducting missile strikes from drones to target extremists in such countries as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. About a third (35%) disapprove of U.S. drone attacks. Public opinion about U.S. drone strikes has changed only modestly since February 2013, when 56% approved and 26% disapproved of drone attacks. Support for drone strikes crosses party lines, though Republicans (74%) are more likely than independents (56%) or Democrats (52%) to favor the use of drones to target extremists. While men approve of drone attacks by more than two-to-one (67% to 28%), the balance of opinion is much narrower among women. Half (50%) of women approve of the use of drones to target extremists, while 42% disapprove. The public’s concerns about possible consequences from drone attacks also are little changed from two years ago. Overall, 48% say they are very concerned that U.S. drone strikes endanger the lives of innocent civilians, while another 32% say they are somewhat concerned about this. Earlier this year, two hostages, including one American, were killed by a U.S. drone strike targeting an al Qaeda compound along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The public expresses less concern over other potential consequences of U.S. drone attacks. About three-in-ten or fewer say they are very concerned U.S. strikes could lead to retaliation from extremist groups (31%), that they are being conducted legally (29%) or that they could damage America’s reputation around the world (24%). The survey finds continued public pessimism about the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. A majority (56%) says the United States has mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan; 36% say the United States has mostly succeeded. These views are little changed from early last year. A declining share of Americans sees prospects for long-term stability in Afghanistan. Just 29% say it is likely that Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government following the departure of U.S. forces from the country. More than twice as many (68%) say this outcome is unlikely. These opinions have become more negative since 2011, when 38% saw some likelihood of Afghanistan maintaining a stable government after U.S. forces left the country. Meanwhile, President Obama’s plan to delay the withdrawal of some 10,000 U.S. forces from Afghanistan, which he announced in March, draws bipartisan support. Overall, 58% approve of Obama’s decision to keep the troops in Afghanistan through the end of this year, while 39% disapprove. Majorities of Democrats (60%), independents (59%) and Republicans (58%) approve of Obama’s decision. There are significant differences in views of U.S. drone strikes across demographic groups, including differences by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and education. Young adults are among the least likely to approve of the drone attacks. Among those ages 18-29, about as many disapprove of the drone attacks (50%) as say they approve of them (48%). Among all older age cohorts, majorities express support for the attacks. Across racial and ethnic groups, whites (66%) are far more likely to approve of the drone attacks than are blacks (46%) and Hispanics (39%). About two-thirds of college graduates (66%) and those with some college experience (64%) say they approve of the U.S. conducting missile strikes from pilotless aircraft to target extremists. Among those with no college experience, 49% approve of the drone attacks, compared with 42% who say they disapprove. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (74%) approve of the drone attacks, compared with smaller majorities of independents (56%) and Democrats (52%). There is a divide within the Democratic Party on the U.S. use of drones: Conservative and moderate Democrats approve of the drone attacks by a 56%-36% margin. By contrast, liberal Democrats are about evenly divided (48% approve, 45% disapprove). Partisan differences in overall views of U.S. drone strikes extend to concerns over whether they endanger the lives of innocent civilians. Democrats (55%) are 23 points more likely than Republicans (32%) to say they are very concerned about whether U.S. drone strikes endanger the lives of innocent civilians. Independents’ views are similar to those of Democrats: 51% say they are very concerned about the possibility of civilian casualties from drone attacks. On other possible concerns such as damage to America’s reputation, retaliation from extremists, and whether the attacks are being conducted legally, partisan differences are more modest, as relatively few from either party say they are very concerned about these potential issues. In addition to expressing lower levels of support for the U.S. drone strikes generally, women also are more likely than men to express a high level of concern over a range of possible concerns about the attacks. Overall, 54% of women say they are very concerned about whether U.S. drone strikes endanger the lives of innocent civilians. Among men, 41% express this level of concern about the possibility of civilian casualties. Women are 16 points more likely than men to say they are very concerned that the drone attacks could lead to retaliation from extremist groups: 39% of women say this compared with 23% of men. When it comes to concerns about whether the U.S. drone strikes are being conducted legally and whether they damage America’s reputation around the world, women are about 10 points more likely than men to say they are very concerned about each of these issues. Overall, 56% say that the United States has mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan, compared with 36% who say it has mostly succeeded. The current negative state of opinion stands in contrast to views measured in surveys conducted from 2009 to 2011. For example, in May 2011, shortly after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden, 62% answered a forward-looking question by saying they thought the U.S. would definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals. By January 2014, however, public sentiment had turned negative when asked to assess whether the U.S. had succeeded in achieving its goals in Afghanistan (52% mostly failed, 38% mostly succeeded). The decline in assessments of U.S. achievements in Afghanistan has occurred across party lines. In June 2011, most Republicans (67%) and Democrats (61%) said they thought the U.S. would definitely or probably succeed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. The current survey finds opinion is much more negative among both groups: fewer than half of Republicans (30%) and Democrats (43%) now say they think the U.S. has mostly succeeded in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. Perceptions of the future stability of the government in Afghanistan have become more negative since last measured in June 2011. Four years ago, the public also had doubts about the ability of Afghanistan to maintain a stable government after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, but doubts outweighed optimism by a narrower margin (57% unlikely vs. 38% likely). Fully 68% of Americans say it is either very unlikely (35%) or somewhat unlikely (33%) that Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government after U.S. forces leave the country. About a quarter (24%) say it is somewhat likely Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government and just 5% say this is very likely. As is the case with views of U.S. success in Afghanistan, there are only modest partisan differences on the question of whether Afghanistan will be able to maintain a stable government once U.S. troops leave the country. Majorities of Republicans (74%), independents (69%) and Democrats (62%) say it is either very or somewhat unlikely that the Afghan government will be stable after the withdrawal of U.S. troops.","The survey finds continued public pessimism about the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan .

The region had one of the highest percentages of people living in extreme poverty, the highest number of deaths among children under 5 and among mothers, and the lowest primary school enrollment rate. Since those goals were set, the area that includes roughly 1 billion people made considerable progress improving the living conditions for many people. But as the UN looks to adopt new goals for the next 15 years, sub-Saharan Africa still lags behind other developing regions, particularly in the areas of poverty, health care and education. This reality for many in Africa comes through in the recent Pew Research Center survey of 9,062 people across nine sub-Saharan African countries, which found that medians of at least eight-in-ten say these three issues are the most pressing challenges for their country. Many of the countries surveyed in sub-Saharan Africa have seen some of the world’s highest economic growth rates in the past decade, which has led to high levels of economic optimism for the future. Yet a median of 88% still say that a lack of job opportunities is a very big problem in their country. Indeed, sub-Saharan Africa made the least progress among all developing regions toward reducing extreme poverty since 1990 (the reference date for the goals set in 2000). Today, the percentage of people living on less than $1.25 a day in sub-Saharan Africa (41%) is more than twice as high as any other region (such as Southern Asia, with 17%). Health care has also remained a key challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Roughly eight-in-ten (median of 82%) across the nine countries surveyed say poor-quality health care is a very big problem in their nation. On this issue, sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind other areas of the world on key indicators such as the mortality rates for children under 5 and for mothers. Between 1990 and 2015, sub-Saharan Africa decreased the number of deaths among children under 5 by 52%. Even so, the region continues to have the highest under-5 mortality rate, with 86 deaths per 1,000 live births. And while maternal deaths dropped by 49% since 1990, sub-Saharan Africa still has a maternal mortality rate more than twice that of any other region (510 per 100,000 live births in sub-Saharan Africa compared with 190 in Southern Asia, the next-highest). When it comes to education, sub-Saharan Africa stands out for making the biggest improvement in access to education since 1990 compared with other regions of the world. The proportion of children enrolled in primary or secondary school increased by 54% over the past 25 years. Nonetheless, the region has not caught up with other parts of the globe. Every other developing region has reached roughly 95% net enrollment or higher, compared with 80% in sub-Saharan Africa. Perhaps not surprisingly, our poll finds that a median of 81% across the nine countries surveyed in this region say poor-quality schools are a major domestic problem. Another key part of the UN’s goals was a commitment worldwide to develop a global partnership for development. On this objective, net official development assistance from member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development increased by 66% between 2000 and 2014. But this increase seems to have leveled off after 2013. Possibly because of the magnitude of the challenges they continue to face, a median of 68% across the nine African countries surveyed by Pew Research Center say their nation needs more foreign aid than it receives today.

Right amount of pressure","Years of warnings about low test scores and underperforming schools seem to have had an impact on the U.S. public. A solid majority of Americans wanted parents to put more pressure on children to perform well academically. In a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, 64% said American parents were not putting enough pressure on their children to do well in school; just 11% felt parents were putting too much pressure on their kids and 21% thought the amount of pressure was about right. The view that parents were not pushing their kids hard enough was especially common among 30 to 49 year-olds (72%), the age group most likely to have children under age 18. Globally, Americans stand out on this question. Among 21 nations polled, the U.S. had the highest percentage saying parents should apply more pressure. Views were quite different in China, the only country where a majority (68%) said parents put too much pressure on their children to succeed in school. The Chinese education system’s intense focus on test-taking has received a fair amount of attention in recent years, especially after Shanghai students topped the rankings for math, science, and reading on the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) exam. But apparently many Chinese believed the long hours of test prep – according to the OECD 80% of Shanghai students have after school tutoring – were a bit too much.","In a 2011 Pew Research Center survey , 64 % said American parents were not putting enough pressure on their children to do well in school ; just 11 % felt parents were putting too much pressure on their kids and 21 % thought the amount of pressure was about right .

At the end of each year, we compile a list of some of our most noteworthy findings. Here are 19 striking findings from our research this year: 1Hispanics are projected to be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the 2020 U.S. electorate, overtaking the number of black eligible voters for the first time. Hispanics are expected to account for just over 13% of eligible voters, slightly more than the share of black eligible voters. In absolute numbers, a projected 32 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2020, compared with 30 million black adults. The population of Asians eligible to vote will reach an estimated 11 million, more than double the 5 million who were eligible to vote in 2000. Asians will account for 5% of next year’s electorate. Taken together, nonwhites will account for a third of eligible voters, their largest share ever. 2The decline of Christianity is continuing at a rapid pace in the U.S. Around two-thirds of U.S. adults (65%) describe themselves as Christian, according to Pew Research Center telephone surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019. That’s down 12 percentage points since 2009. At the same time, the share of “nones” – religiously unaffiliated adults who describe their religion as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” – has reached 26%, up from 17% a decade ago. 3The U.S. no longer leads the world in admitting refugees. Canada resettled more refugees than the U.S. did in 2018, marking the first time the U.S. did not lead the world on this measure since Congress created the nation’s refugee program in 1980. While Canada resettled 28,000 refugees in 2018 – similar to its total in 2017 – the U.S. resettled 23,000, down from 33,000 the year before and far below a recent high of 97,000 in 2016. The U.S. had previously admitted more refugees each year than all other countries combined. Looking ahead, the number of refugees resettled in the U.S. is likely to decrease further: The Trump administration set a new cap of 18,000 refugees in the 2020 fiscal year. 4The share of Americans with an unfavorable view of China reached a 14-year high amid a protracted trade dispute between the two countries. Six-in-ten U.S. adults have a negative opinion of China, up from 47% in 2018 and the highest share since Pew Research Center began asking Americans this question in 2005. Americans also increasingly see China as a threat. Around a quarter of Americans (24%) name China as the country or group that poses the greatest threat to the U.S. in the future, double the share who said this in 2007. China is tied with Russia (24%) as the country or group most cited by Americans as a threat to the U.S.; the only other country to measure in the double digits is North Korea (12%). 5Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, people in many former communist countries in Europe see greatly improved standards of living. Since 1991, there have been large increases in the share of adults who think the changes that swept through the region in 1989 and 1991 have had a good influence on living standards in their country. In Poland, for example, only 14% of people said in 1991 that the recent changes had had a positive influence on living standards. By 2019, that figure had shot up to 81%, more than a fivefold increase. In Lithuania, the share saying this has soared from just 9% in 1991 to 70% this year. 6The foreign-born share of the U.S. population is at its highest point since 1910. Nearly 14% of people living in the U.S. in 2017 were born in another country, extending a steady increase over the past few decades. In absolute numbers, more than 44 million immigrants lived in the U.S. – more than in any other country in the world. The foreign-born share of the U.S. population, however, is far from the highest in the world. In 2017, 25 countries and territories had higher shares of foreign-born people than the U.S., including Australia (29%), New Zealand (23%) and Canada (21%), as well as European countries such as Switzerland (30%), Austria (19%) and Sweden (18%). 7Majorities of U.S. military veterans – as well as the broader U.S. public – say the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not worth fighting. Among veterans, 64%  say the war in Iraq was not worth fighting, while 58% say the same about the war in Afghanistan. The American public holds similar views: 62% and 59% of U.S. adults, respectively, say the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not worth it, considering the costs and the benefits. When asked about the U.S. military campaign in Syria, 55% of veterans and 58% of the public say the campaign has not been worth it. 8A majority of Americans do not think it is possible to go about daily life without corporate and government entities collecting information about them. Americans widely believe at least some of their online and offline activities are being tracked and monitored by companies and the government. It is such a common condition of modern life, in fact, that roughly six-in-ten U.S. adults say they don’t think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies (62% say this) or the government (63%). 9U.S. newspaper circulation has fallen to its lowest level since at least 1940, the earliest year with available data. Total daily newspaper circulation – print and digital combined – was an estimated 28.6 million for weekday and 30.8 million for Sunday in 2018. Those numbers were down 8% and 9%, respectively, from the previous year and are now below their lowest recorded levels (though weekday circulation first passed this threshold in 2013). 10Two-thirds of Americans support the legalization of marijuana, a dramatic reversal from two decades ago. Legalizing the drug – which remains banned under federal law – has the backing of a majority of men and women; white, black and Hispanic adults; and Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and Republicans and Republican leaners (though Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to favor it, 78% vs. 55%). Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of U.S. adults (91%) say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use (59%) or that it should be legal just for medical use (32%). Fewer than one-in-ten (8%) prefer to keep marijuana illegal in all circumstances. 11The number of people living in the U.S. without authorization has decreased over the past decade, driven by a sharp decline in unauthorized immigrants from Mexico. As a result, Mexicans no longer account for the majority of unauthorized immigrants in the country. In 2007, there were 12.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., including 6.9 million Mexicans. By 2017, there were 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants, including 4.9 million Mexicans. While the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico has decreased, the numbers from two regions – Asia and Central America – have risen. Overall, there were 5.5 million unauthorized immigrants from countries other than Mexico in 2017, compared with 5.3 million in 2007. One reflection of the changing migration patterns is at the U.S.-Mexico border, where apprehensions of non-Mexican migrants vastly outnumbered those of Mexicans in the 2019 fiscal year (80% vs. 20%). In 2000, by comparison, non-Mexicans accounted for just 2% of apprehensions at the southwest border, while Mexicans accounted for 98%. 12Roughly six-in-ten Americans (63%) say the legacy of slavery still affects black people in the U.S. today. This is particularly the case for black Americans, 84% of whom say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in the U.S. today either a great deal (59%) or a fair amount (25%). By comparison, 26% of whites, 29% of Hispanics and 33% of Asians say the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society a great deal, though majorities in each group say it does so at least a fair amount. This year marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slave ship in Jamestown, Virginia. 13Political independents who don’t lean toward one party or the other account for only 7% of Americans. While they are often portrayed as political free agents with the potential to bridge the nation’s rigid partisan divisions, most independents are not all that “independent” politically. An overwhelming majority of independents (81%) “lean” toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. And the small share of Americans who don’t lean toward either party stand out for their low level of interest in politics. 14Despite the economic troubles facing the news industry, about seven-in-ten Americans (71%) believe their local news media organizations are doing well financially. This belief persists even though only 14% of U.S. adults say they personally have paid for local news within the past year, whether through subscriptions, donations or memberships. When asked why they don’t pay for local news, around half of non-payers (49%) point to the widespread availability of free content. 15The most active 10% of adult Twitter users in the U.S. produce 80% of all tweets sent by these users. The median adult user of the platform tweets just twice a month, but a small group tweets much more frequently, according to our April study. There was an even starker pattern in a follow-up study that looked specifically at tweets about national politics. In that study, 97% of tweets that were created by U.S. adults and mentioned national politics came from just 10% of users. 16Roughly a third of Gen Zers (35%) say they know someone who prefers to be referred to using gender-neutral pronouns. Gen Zers (Americans born after 1996) are more likely than Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) to say they know someone who prefers this: 35% say this is the case, compared with a quarter of Millennials and smaller shares in older generations. The youngest generation is also the most likely to say that forms or online profiles that ask about a person’s gender should include options other than “man” or “woman.” Roughly six-in-ten Gen Zers (59%) hold this view, compared with half of Millennials and four-in-ten or fewer Gen Xers (born 1965 to 1980), Baby Boomers (1946 to 1964) and members of the Silent Generation (born 1928 to 1945). 17The U.S. public renders a harsh judgment on the state of political discourse in the country today. Large majorities of Americans say the tone and nature of political debate has become more negative in recent years, as well as less respectful, less fact-based and less substantive. President Donald Trump is a major factor in people’s views: A 55% majority says Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate in the country for the worse. Fewer than half as many (24%) say he has changed it for the better, while 20% say he has had little impact. 18Concerns about climate change have risen in the U.S., but most of the change has come among Democrats. The share of Americans who see global climate change as a major threat to the well-being of the U.S. has increased from 40% in 2013 to 57% this year, but Republican attitudes about this have changed little. Around a quarter of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (27%) now say climate change is a major threat, about the same as the 22% who said this in 2013. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, by contrast, 84% say global climate change is a major threat, up from 58% in 2013. Nearly all liberal Democrats (94%) consider climate change a major threat to the nation, up 30 percentage points from 2013. Three-quarters of moderate and conservative Democrats also say this, up from 54% in 2013. By contrast, there has been no statistically significant change among either moderate or conservative Republicans. 19A single person watching YouTube videos for eight hours a day with no breaks or days off would need more than 16 years to watch all the content posted by just the most popular channels on the platform during a single week.

The average video on these channels was roughly 12 minutes long and received 58,358 views during its first week on the site.

A national opinion survey of Mexico by the Pew Research Center, conducted March 4-17 among 1,000 adults, finds that roughly two-thirds (66%) of Mexicans have a favorable opinion of the U.S. – up from 56% a year ago and dramatically higher than it was following the passage of Arizona’s restrictive immigration law in 2010, when favorable Mexican attitudes toward the United States slipped to 44%. Obama also receives higher ratings than he did in recent years. About half (49%) of Mexicans express confidence in the American president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs, compared with 42% who said the same in 2012 and 38% in 2011. Still, Mexicans’ confidence in Obama has yet to return to the level in his first days in office in 2009, when 55% gave him a high rating. Mexicans are also now more of the view that the U.S. takes their country’s interests into account when deciding international policy. About half (51%) say Washington considers their country’s interests, while 45% say it does not. In 2012, opinion leaned in the opposite direction – 56% said the U.S. did not consider Mexico’s interests, compared with 40% who said it did. Bilateral issues, particularly the deepening of economic and commercial relations between the U.S. and Mexico, are expected to be among the key items on the agenda when Obama meets with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this week. The survey finds that, overall, 70% of Mexicans consider the deep economic ties between the two countries to be good for Mexico, down slightly from 76% in 2009, when Pew Research last asked this question. When asked specifically about the influence the U.S. is currently having on economic conditions in their country, views are more mixed. One-third of Mexicans say the U.S. is having a positive impact on national economic conditions in Mexico, while 28% think the U.S. is having a bad impact on their country’s economy. More than 11 million Mexicans live in the U.S., including about 6 million who are in the country illegally.1 Mexicans are divided on whether this is good or bad for their country; 44% say it is good for Mexico that many of its citizens live in the U.S., and an equal share say this is bad for Mexico. About six-in-ten Mexicans (61%) say they would not move to the U.S. even if they had the means and opportunity to do so. However, a sizable minority (35%) say they would move to the U.S. if they could, including 20% who say they would emigrate without authorization. Mexicans are less likely than they were a year ago to say that people from their country who move to the U.S. have a better life there; 47% say life is better in the U.S., compared with 53% in 2012. About one-in-five (18%) say Mexicans have a worse life in the U.S., while 29% say it is neither better nor worse. However, among those who have close friends or relatives living in the U.S., 70% say these friends or relatives have achieved their goals, while just 25% believe they have been disappointed. Three-in-ten Mexicans say they personally know someone who went to the U.S. but returned to Mexico because the person could not find work. About a quarter (27%) know someone who has been deported or detained by the U.S. government for immigration reasons in the last 12 months. Less often than a year ago, Mexicans say their government is making progress in its campaign against drug traffickers; 37% say this is the case, compared with 47% in 2012. An additional 29% now say the government is losing ground against the cartels, and 30% see no change in the way things are going. As in the past, Mexicans overwhelmingly support the use of the Mexican army to fight drug traffickers; 85% are in favor of this approach. There is also support for some cooperation from the U.S. in the fight against Mexican drug cartels. About three-quarters (74%) would welcome U.S. assistance in training Mexican police and military personnel. A majority (55%) would also approve of the U.S. providing money and weapons to the country’s police and military, although this position has lost some support in recent years; 61% backed this form of U.S. assistance in 2012 and 64% did so in 2011. However, there is little enthusiasm for the deployment of U.S. troops to Mexico to fight drug traffickers; just 34% of Mexicans would welcome this approach, while 59% would oppose it. Most Mexicans (56%) blame both the U.S. and their own country for the drug violence in Mexico; 20% say the U.S. is mostly to blame and 17% blame Mexico. When Pew Research first asked this question in 2009, far more blamed the U.S. (25%) than blamed Mexico (15%), while about half (51%) said the countries shared responsibility. Peña Nieto, whose election as president in 2012 marked the return to power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after 12 years in the opposition, is generally viewed positively in Mexico; 57% say he is having a good influence on the way things are going in the country, while 38% see his influence as bad. However, Mexicans expressed mixed views of Peña Nieto’s handling of some key issues. In particular, the same share approves as disapproves of the way the president is dealing with the economy (46%). Similarly, 47% approve of his handling of organized crime and drug traffickers, while 45% disapprove. And when it comes to dealing with corruption, 44% approve of Peña Nieto’s approach and 48% disapprove. Not surprisingly, on all three issues, those who are affiliated with the PRI offer more positive ratings of the president than do those who are affiliated with Felipe Calderón’s National Action Party (PAN). At least six-in-ten supporters of the PRI approve of the president’s handling of the economy (68%), organized crime and drug traffickers (62%) and corruption (62%). In contrast, 46% of PAN supporters approve of the way he is dealing with the economy and corruption, and 51% give him high marks for his handling of drug cartels.","Less often than a year ago , Mexicans say their government is making progress in its campaign against drug traffickers ; 37 % say this is the case , compared with 47 % in 2012 .

About two-in-ten (19%) say Houston’s sudden death at 48 was their top story of the week; 18% say they followed news about candidates for the presidential election most closely, while 15% say their top story was news about the economy, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Feb. 16-20 among 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Those same stories led coverage. News about the campaign made up 16% of the newshole, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). News about the economy accounted for 12%; an additional 4% of coverage focused on a related story – the payroll tax extension approved by Congress. News about Houston’s death made up 10% of the newshole. None of the top stories drew especially strong interest last week. A third (33%) say they followed news about the economy very closely, down from 42% one week earlier. A quarter (25%) say they followed news about the candidates very closely, down from 35% the prior week. About two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about Houston’s death in Beverly Hills very closely. Houston’s death drew strong interest from African Americans. Four-in-ten blacks (40%) say they paid very close attention to news about Houston’s death, compared with just 13% of whites. And far more women (25%) than men (10%) say they followed news about Houston’s death very closely. Though a plurality continues to say that Mitt Romney is the Republican candidate they have heard most about in the news recently, Romney and Rick Santorum are about equally visible among Republican and Republican-leaning independents. Looking at the public as a whole, 41% say they have heard the most about Romney recently and 27% say they have heard the most about Santorum. One week ago, despite Santorum wins in recent caucuses and primaries, the divide was wider: 50% said Romney was the most visible candidate; 19% said Santorum was. Among Republicans and GOP leaners, about as many (41%) now say they are hearing most about Romney as say they are hearing most about Santorum (35%). One week ago, 52% said that candidate was Romney, while about half as many said Santorum (24%). With his recent surge, Santorum also has drawn close to Romney in coverage. According to PEJ, Romney was a significant figure in 55% of campaign stories last week, while Santorum was a significant figure in 50%. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul were major players in far fewer stories (14% and 3%, respectively). One week earlier, Romney was a significant figure in 57% of stories, Santorum in 46%, Gingrich in 28% and Paul in 4%. The 18% who say they followed news about Houston’s death very closely is less than the 30% that followed news about the death of Michael Jackson very closely in the days immediately after his death in June 2009. In a week without major developments on the campaign trail, a quarter (25%) say they followed news about candidates for the 2012 presidential elections very closely; 18% say election news was their top story. Though partisans are about equally likely to say they followed this news very closely, Republicans are more likely to say this was the news they followed most closely: 27% of Republicans say this, compared with 18% of Democrats and 14% of independents. For Republicans, the campaign was the week’s top story. About a quarter of the public (24%) say they very closely followed news about Congress passing legislation to extend payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits that otherwise would have expired. This was the top story for 6%. News about the legislation accounted for 4% of coverage. Partisans are about equally likely to say they followed last week’s congressional action very closely. Public attention was greater last summer when lawmakers agreed to raise the federal debt limit. At the start of August, nearly half (46%) said they had closely followed that news. About two-in-ten (21%) say they very closely followed news about international tensions over Iran’s nuclear program; 8% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about Iran accounted for 5% of coverage. About one-in-ten (11%) say they followed news about efforts to deal with the debt crisis in Europe very closely. That was before this week’s major agreement to deal with Greece’s financial troubles. Efforts to deal with the debt crisis was the top story for 4%, and accounted for 2% of coverage. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected Feb. 13-19, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected Feb. 16-20, 2012 from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults.","In a week without major developments on the campaign trail , a quarter ( 25 % ) say they followed news about candidates for the 2012 presidential elections very closely ; 18 % say election news was their top story .

The overall rise in positive assessments seen over the last year is driven by the shifting views of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (74%) now view the economy in positive terms. That is a marked improvement from last October (57%). In December 2016, shortly after the presidential election, just 14% of Republicans rated the economy as excellent or good. By contrast, just 37% of Democrats say the economy is in excellent or good shape. This is modestly higher than last fall (when 30% said this), but lower than the 46% who said this in December 2016. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted March 7-14 among 1,466 adults, also finds a wider partisan difference in personal economic assessments than in recent years. Today, 62% of Republicans say their personal financial situation is in excellent or good shape, compared with 44% of Democrats who say the same. GOP views have improved substantially since Donald Trump’s election. Democratic views have changed little following the shift in administration. Democrats are somewhat less positive about their future personal financial situation than they were during Barack Obama’s presidency, while Republicans have become more bullish. Today Republicans are 19 percentage points more likely to say they expect their personal finances to improve over the next year (82% vs. 63%). Throughout much of Obama’s tenure, the expectations gap was the reverse. The survey finds that Americans’ views of factors affecting their personal financial pressures have changed somewhat in recent years. In particular, far fewer Americans (37%) say the price of gas affects their personal finances “a lot” than did so in 2013 or 2011, during periods of higher gas prices. In those years, majorities said the price of gas affected their household finances a lot (64% in 2013, 69% in 2011). About half each say health care costs (53%) and the price of food and consumer goods (48%) have a major impact. By contrast, just 22% say the federal budget deficit affects their finances a lot and 21% say the same about “how the stock market is doing.” Unlike overall opinions about the economy and personal financial evaluations, views of financial pressures are not all that partisan. However, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say that health care costs and real estate values affect their household finances a lot. Among members of both parties, particularly Republicans, the shares saying the federal budget deficit has a major effect on their finances is much lower today than it was in 2011. The share of Republicans who say the deficit affects their finances a lot has declined by about half since 2011, from 48% to 23%. About one-in-five Democrats (22%) also say the deficit has a big financial impact, down from 38% seven years ago. This is the latest indication of diminished public concern over the budget deficit. In Pew Research Center’s annual policy priorities survey in January, 48% of Americans said that reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress, down from 72% in 2013. The decline came among members of both parties, though the shift among Republicans was more pronounced. The current survey comes 10 years after the collapse of Bear Stearns, seen by many as the moment the extent of the financial crisis became clear. In March 2008, just days after the firm’s collapse, only 11% of the public said that national economic conditions were good or excellent, while 32% said they were only fair and 56% said they were poor. The share viewing the economy in positive terms changed little over the next several years – but the share saying the economy was poor increased as the economic crisis deepened, reaching 71% in February 2009. The trajectory of these views differed for Republicans and Democrats. In March 2008, though few in either party had positive views of economic conditions, the assessments of Republicans and Republican leaners were somewhat more positive than those of Democrats and Democratic leaners: 23% of Republicans rated national economic conditions as good or excellent, compared with only 4% of Democrats. After Barack Obama took office, these views reversed, and throughout most of Obama’s presidency Democrats were more likely than Republicans to view economic conditions positively. Since Trump’s election, Republicans have grown substantially more positive about the state of the national economy. Currently Republicans are twice as likely as Democrats to say that national economic conditions are excellent or good (74% to 37%). Looking ahead, the public has mixed views of how they think the national economy will perform over the next year. While slightly more say they expect conditions to be better a year from now (34%) than worse (25%), 40% expect conditions to be about the same. While opinions about the economy are much better today than they were a decade ago, the public’s economic expectations are similar to views at that time. In March 2008, 33% expected the economy to be better a year from then, 22% worse and 39% about the same. The public became increasingly optimistic about the economy in 2008 and early 2009, as conditions worsened. But economic optimism subsequently declined. Republicans and Democrats currently have starkly different expectations. While 59% of Republicans say economic conditions will get better in a year, just 10% of Democrats say the same. Four-in-ten Democrats expect economic conditions to get worse over the next year, compared with just 9% of Republicans (31% of Republicans and 48% of Democrats expect conditions to stay about the same). While economic expectations do not differ by income in the public overall, the picture is very different within each of the two parties. Higher-income Republicans are more likely than those with lower incomes to say that they expect economic conditions to improve in the next year: 68% of those with family incomes of $75,000 or more say this, compared with 50% of those with incomes of less than $30,000. Among Democrats, the pattern is reversed; lower-income Democrats are modestly more likely to say they expect economic conditions to improve (though this view is not widely held among Democrats at any income level), and while 52% of Democrats with incomes of $75,000 or more expect conditions to worsen, that view is only held by about a third (35%) of those with lower family incomes. Republicans and Republican leaners have become significantly more optimistic about the future economy since Trump took office. Today, 59% say they expect conditions to be better a year from now. Until Trump’s election, no more than a third of Republicans had expressed this sentiment during Obama’s administration. However, the current share of Republicans expressing this optimistic view is down from the three-quarters (75%) of Republicans and Republican leaners who said this in February 2017, shortly after Trump’s inauguration. Today, 40% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they expect conditions to get worse in the coming year, down 9 percentage points since February 2017, but still higher than at any point during Obama’s presidency. Among the factors that affect household finances, the public ranks the cost of health care and the prices of food and consumer goods highest. About half of Americans say the cost of health care affects their household’s financial situation a lot (53%), and nearly as many (48%) say the same about prices of food and consumer goods. Real estate values (37%), gas prices (37%) and the availability of jobs (34%) are mentioned by about a third of Americans as affecting their household’s finances a lot. Only about two-in-ten say the same of the stock market (21%) or the federal budget deficit (22%). Today, far fewer consider gas prices as a top pressure than did so seven years ago: In April 2011, when gas prices were far higher than they have been in recent years, fully 69% of Americans said gas prices affected their situation a lot – the highest of the six factors included in the survey. Today, the cost of health care – asked for the first time in this survey – ranks higher than most other pressures. Fewer today see the federal budget deficit as a chief concern for their household’s financial situation than did so in 2011, and the then 10-percentage-point partisan gap in assessments of its personal impact has dissipated. And while the prices of food and consumer goods remains a top pressure for household finances, the share reporting it affects them a lot has dipped 10 points since 2011, from 58% to 48%. Those who say the availability of jobs affects their finances a lot also has declined slightly from 2011, in the midst of the financial recession, when 42% said it impacted their household finances a lot. The share who say their households are affected a lot by the stock market or real estate values is little different today than it was seven years ago. There continue to be wide differences across income categories in assessments of the impact of financial pressures, but health care costs is a top household financial pressure across all income levels. About half (53%) of households earning $100,000 or more a year say it affects their financial situations a lot; about as many (52%) of those earning $30,000 a year or less say the same. On the impact of other pressures, there are some substantial differences across income groups. While about six-in-ten in lower income households say the prices of food and consumer goods impacts their finances a lot (59% of those in households with incomes of less than $30,000 a year), four-in-ten of those in higher income households say the same (40% of households making $75,000 annually or more). Gas prices are also more likely to be characterized as having a lot of impact among middle- and low-income households than higher-income households: Just 26% of those with family incomes of $100,000 or more say this, compared with about four-in-ten of those with lower family incomes. By contrast, high-earning households are more likely to see real estate values as affecting them (46% of those with family incomes of $100,000 or more a year, compared with only about a third of those with lower incomes). And while about one-in-three with family incomes of $75,000 or more (32%) say the stock market affects their households’ finances a lot, only 15% of those with lower family incomes say this.","Among the factors that affect household finances , the public ranks the cost of health care and the prices of food and consumer goods highest .

Between Feb. 24, 2016 – when Facebook first gave its users the option of clicking on the “angry” reaction, as well as the emotional reactions “love,” “sad,” “haha” and “wow” – and Election Day, the congressional Facebook audience used the “angry” button in response to lawmakers’ posts a total of 3.6 million times. But during the same amount of time following the election, that number increased more than threefold, to nearly 14 million. The trend toward using the “angry” reaction continued during the last three months of 2017. Use of the “love” reaction also increased after Election Day, but at a slower rate. Users reacted to congressional posts with the “love” button 7 million times in the period before the election, a figure that rose to about 12 million in the period afterward. While “love” was the most popular new reaction before the election, “angry” became the most popular afterward. To arrive at these figures, Pew Research Center analyzed all Facebook posts created by members of Congress on or after Feb. 24, 2016, and extending through July 24, 2017 – a total of 360,173 individual posts. While the use of all five new emotional reactions increased across the study period, the use of the “angry” reaction outpaced the other four new emoji options. “Angry” increased by 385%, compared with 169% for “love.” The use of “sad” increased by 315%, moving from 1.5 million to 4.8 million total reactions. The “wow” and “haha” reactions were less popular overall, but still increased by 244% and 191%, respectively. While anger became the most popular new reaction after the 2016 election, “likes” have always been the most popular way for people to engage with congressional Facebook posts. Between Feb. 24 and Nov. 8, 2016, congressional posts received 111 million “likes,” a number that increased by 17% percent, to 129 million, between the day after the 2016 election and July 24, 2017. The increased popularity of anger after the election is also apparent when examining the share of emotional reactions and “likes” that individual posts received. By that measure, anger emerged as the most popular reaction – other than “likes” – soon after President Donald Trump’s January 2017 inauguration, beating out the “love” reaction for the first time. By the end of 2017, the difference became much more pronounced. Just 2% of all Facebook reactions to congressional posts were “angry” in the period leading up to the 2016 election. But after the election and through the end of 2017, that share tripled, to 6%. By December 2017, 11% of lawmakers’ posts received “angry” responses, including 9% of posts by Democrats and 13% of posts by Republicans. (This part of the Center’s analysis includes the full set of congressional posts created between Feb. 24, 2016, and the end of 2017 – 465,864 posts. It also includes the “thankful” reaction, which Facebook introduced for Mother’s Day in 2017.) When it comes to the content of congressional Facebook posts, those that were more confrontational were more likely to inspire “angry” reactions. Confrontational posts are defined as those that expressed opposition toward a number of politicians and political groups, including Trump, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Democrats and Republicans. Overall, 69,318 posts – 15% of all posts created between Feb. 24, 2016, and Dec. 31, 2017 – expressed opposition. Among posts that expressed this kind of confrontational rhetoric, 13% of the reactions to the average post received “angry” feedback. By comparison, just 3% of reactions for posts that did not express political opposition were angry. However, when it comes to the “love” reaction, there was no meaningful difference in the rates at which the congressional Facebook audience responded to confrontational posts (about 4% both for posts expressing opposition and for those not expressing opposition).

But even before the test – which Washington and Seoul labeled “destabilizing and unlawful” – Americans and many people in the Asia-Pacific region held negative views of North Korea and its nuclear weapons program. Here are four new key findings from Pew Research Center about views of North Korea and its nuclear program, based on a survey conducted in the U.S. and six Asia-Pacific countries between February and May. 1Many people in Asia-Pacific countries have negative views of North Korea. Among the countries surveyed, the Japanese are most negative on North Korea: 94% say they have an unfavorable view, including 78% who say they have a very unfavorable opinion. In Australia, the U.S. and South Korea, roughly three-quarters or more say they have unfavorable views. Across the region, only Filipinos have a generally positive view of North Korea, with more than half (53%) holding a favorable view. 2Americans and most people in the Asia-Pacific countries surveyed are concerned about North Korea’s nuclear program. Half or more in each country say they are somewhat or very concerned about the nuclear program. In the Asia-Pacific region, anxiety is highest among Pyongyang’s closest neighbors – Japan, the Philippines and South Korea, where around 60% or more say they are very concerned. 3People in the region are divided about whether increasing economic sanctions or deepening ties is the better response to North Korea’s nuclear program. Although people in the Asia-Pacific countries surveyed are largely united in their concerns about the nuclear program, there is no clear consensus about how best to deal with the issue. Among the more economically developed countries, the preference is for increasing economic sanctions. Half or more Americans, Japanese, South Koreans and Australians believe increasing sanctions will be more effective than deepening ties. But opinion is more divided in the developing countries in the region. A plurality of Vietnamese and Filipinos say the nuclear problem should be handled by deepening ties with North Korea, and in Indonesia, large shares volunteered that neither was a good strategy (18%) or said they did not know (23%). 4Japanese and South Koreans expect the U.S. to come to their aid in the event of a conflict with North Korea – and Americans support such a move. Two close neighbors of North Korea, Japan and South Korea, are also U.S. treaty allies, meaning that if North Korea used military force against them, the U.S. would be obligated to defend them. In both countries, large majorities expect this would happen: 91% of South Koreans expect U.S. assistance in the event of a military conflict with North Korea, and 82% of Japanese say the same. Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) say the U.S. should use military force to defend its allies in Asia in the event that they get into a serious military conflict with North Korea.

By a margin of nearly two-to-one (62% to 32%), more Americans now say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry than say they are opposed. Views on same-sex marriage have shifted dramatically in recent years. As recently as 2010, more Americans opposed (48%) than favored (42%) allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. In the past year alone, support has increased seven percentage points: In March 2016, 55% favored same-sex marriage, while 37% were opposed. The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted June 8-18 among 2,504 adults finds striking increases in support for same-sex marriage among some demographic and partisan groups that, until recently, had broadly opposed it, including: Baby Boomers. For the first time, a majority of Baby Boomers favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Currently, 56% of Boomers favor same-sex marriage, while 39% are opposed. Last year, opinion among Boomers was divided (46% favored/48% opposed). African Americans. Blacks have long been less supportive of same-sex marriage when compared with whites, but the share of African Americans who favor same-sex marriage has risen 12 percentage points since 2015, from 39% to 51%. Republicans. For the first time, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents do not oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Today, 48% of Republicans and Republican leaners oppose same-sex marriage, while 47% favor this. As recently as 2013, Republicans opposed gay marriage by nearly two-to-one (61% to 33%). Younger white evangelicals. Overall, white evangelical Protestants continue to stand out for their opposition to same-sex-marriage: 35% of white evangelical Protestants favor same-sex marriage, compared with a 59% majority who are opposed. But younger white evangelicals have grown more supportive: 47% of white evangelical Millennials and Gen Xers – age cohorts born after 1964 – favor same-sex marriage, up from 29% in March 2016. Views among older white evangelicals (Boomers and Silents) have shown virtually no change over the past year (26% now, 25% then). For more on current views of same-sex marriage, see detailed demographic tables. Younger Americans continue to be more likely than older Americans to say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally: Fully 74% of Millennials (ages 18 to 36) say they favor same-sex marriage, while just 23% say they are opposed. And by more than two-to-one, more Generation Xers (those ages 37 to 52) favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry than oppose same-sex marriage (65% vs. 29%). Support for same-sex marriage among older adults also has increased over the past ten years. Today, a 56%-majority of Boomers (those ages 53 to 71) say they favor allowing legal same-sex marriage, while a smaller share (39%) say they are opposed. Support among Boomers has increased since March 2016, when just less than half (46%) said they favored same-sex marriage. Among the Silent generation (those ages 72 to 89), 49% oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry, while 41% favor this. However, support for same-sex marriage has nearly doubled among members of the Silent generation since 2007, when just 24% said they were in favor. Support for allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally also has steadily risen across racial and ethnic groups. Six-in-ten or more whites (64%) and Hispanics (60%) say they favor allowing same-sex couples to be married legally. In 2007, just 38% of whites and 37% of Hispanics supported same-sex marriage. Although blacks remain less likely than whites and Hispanics to favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry, the share who favor gay marriage has also dramatically increased over the past decade: Today 51% of blacks support same-sex marriage; in 2007, just 26% did so. There continue to be wide partisan divides on the issue of same-sex marriage, but support has grown among both Republicans and Democrats over the past decade. Republicans and Republican leaners are divided on the question for the first time: 47% favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry, while a nearly identical share is opposed (48%). Fully three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (76%) say they favor allowing same-sex marriage, compared to just 19% who are opposed. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a majority of Millennials (60%) support same-sex marriage, while 38% are opposed. About half of Gen X Republicans (51%) favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Majorities of Republican Baby Boomers (53%) and Republican Silents (62%) continue to oppose same-sex marriage. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, majorities of all generational cohorts support allowing gays and lesbians to marry, though support is greater among younger generations: Nearly nine-in-ten Democratic Millennials (87%) support same-sex marriage, compared with 56% of Democrats in the Silent generation. Views about same-sex marriage continue to differ across religious groups. Wide majorities of Catholics (67%), white mainline Protestants (68%), and – in particular – the religiously unaffiliated (85%) support legal marriage for same-sex couples. By comparison, a majority of white evangelical Protestants oppose same-sex marriage (59% oppose, 35% favor), while black Protestants are roughly divided in their views (44% favor, 50% oppose). Support for same-sex marriage has risen across all religious groups in recent years, including among white evangelicals and black Protestants. Support for same sex-marriage among white Evangelicals has more than doubled compared with a decade ago (14% then, 35% now), while the share of black Protestants who favor same-sex marriage has increased from 24% in 2007 to 44% today. Throughout most of the last decade, the generational gap within white evangelicals was more modest. In 2007, for instance, 12% of Boomer and Silent white evangelicals supported same-sex marriage, compared with 19% of Millennial and Gen Xer white evangelicals. In the new survey, majorities across all educational groups now say they favor same-sex marriage, but levels of support are highest among those who have graduated from college: 79% among those with postgraduate degrees and 72% among those with bachelor’s degrees. Smaller majorities of those with some college experience but no college degree (62%) or those with no more than a high school degree (53%) say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry. While Republicans overall are divided in views of same-sex marriage, moderate and liberal Republicans are much more supportive than are conservative Republicans (63% vs. 39%). There also are wide ideological differences among Democrats, though majorities of conservative and moderate Democrats (66%) and liberal Democrats (90%) favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.","In the new survey , majorities across all educational groups now say they favor same - sex marriage , but levels of support are highest among those who have graduated from college : 79 % among those with postgraduate degrees and 72 % among those with bachelor ’s degrees .

Around half (49%) of Hispanics say they or someone in their household has taken a pay cut or lost a job – or both – because of the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with 33% of all U.S. adults. Among both Hispanics and the wider public, more people say someone has experienced a pay cut or a reduction in work hours than say someone was laid off or lost a job (40% vs. 29% among Hispanics, 27% vs. 20% among all Americans). A recent Center analysis found about 8 million Hispanic workers were employed in restaurants, hotels and other service-sector positions that are at higher risk of job loss. Americans filed a record 6.6 million unemployment claims during the week ending March 28, which came after a record 3.3 million claims were filed the week before. The Hispanic unemployment rate in March stood at 6.0%, up from 4.4% in February. The current rate is likely much higher because the monthly figure is based on data from the second week of March, before the economic impact of the outbreak became widespread. Overall unemployment in the United States stood at 4.4% in March. The U.S. now has the most reported coronavirus cases of any country. Most states have closed nonessential businesses and many have issued stay-at-home orders to their residents. More than four-in-ten Americans (44%), including 47% of Hispanics, say the outbreak has changed their personal life in a major way. Latinos are concerned about the outbreak’s broader economic impact on the nation. The vast majority (90%) say the outbreak is a major threat to the U.S. economy. In addition, the late March survey finds a significant share (42%) saying the coronavirus outbreak will cause a recession, while 16% say it will cause a depression. Another 40% say it will cause a slowdown of the economy but not a recession. For several weeks, many Hispanics have viewed the coronavirus outbreak as a major threat to their personal financial situation. The share saying this reached 68% in the Center’s latest survey (March 19-24), up from 50% who said so less than two weeks earlier (March 10-16). In the period between the two surveys, Congress debated a roughly $2 trillion emergency spending bill that included $1,200 government payments to individuals, an expansion of unemployment benefits and the option to postpone student loan payments. President Donald Trump signed the bill shortly after the latest survey was completed. Hispanics as a group are younger and have lower levels of educational attainment than Americans overall. Young people and those with lower levels of education report having been some of the hardest hit by pay cuts and layoffs, among both the general public and Hispanics. About half (53%) of Latinos ages 18 to 29 and a similar share of those ages 30 to 49 (50%) say they or someone in their household has lost a job or had their pay cut because of the coronavirus outbreak. In contrast, 39% of Latinos 50 and older say the same. Meanwhile, about half of Latinos without a college degree – 50% with a high school degree or less and 52% with some college experience – say they or someone in their household has lost a job or had their pay cut. By comparison, a smaller share of Latinos with a college degree (37%) say they have experienced one of these events. Even so, across all education levels, higher shares of Latinos than of the general public say someone in their household has lost their job, taken a pay cut or both because of the COVID-19 outbreak. While a substantial share of Hispanics are foreign born, these adults report similar experiences with pay cuts and layoffs as Hispanics born in the U.S.","Hispanics are more likely than Americans overall to say they or someone in their household has experienced a pay cut or lost their job because of the coronavirus outbreak , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 19 - 24 .

But 40 years after Roe v. Wade, the legal battles over abortion are far from over. In fact, there has been a substantial amount of activity at the state level, particularly in parts of the Southern and Midwestern U.S., where, according to a July Pew Research Center poll, there is greater opposition to abortion rights among the general public. In 2013 alone, state legislatures have enacted more than 40 new provisions aimed at restricting abortion access, according to the Guttmacher Institute. For instance, seven states this year – including North Carolina this week – have enacted laws imposing new medical requirements on abortion clinics. But while abortion opponents have been winning legislative battles, abortion-rights supporters have been pushing back, with some success, in court. This year, abortion-rights groups have responded to new state laws with lawsuits challenging the new restrictions. In many cases, judges have issued injunctions against or struck down the new statutes. In North Dakota, for instance, a federal judge issued an injunction against a recently enacted law that would have prohibited most abortions after a fetal heartbeat could be detected (as early as six weeks).  And in Wisconsin, a federal court issued an injunction against a new state law that would have required doctors working in abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Another admitting-privileges requirement enacted in Alabama recently was halted by a federal judge. The next big legal battle could be in Texas, where Republican Gov. Rick Perry recently signed a new law banning most abortions after 20 weeks and imposing new medical requirements on abortion clinics that may cause many of them to close. Another potential battleground is North Carolina, where Republican Gov. Pat McCrory on Monday signed into law a measure that also imposes new requirements on clinics. Abortion-rights advocates have said they are considering bringing legal action against both new laws. But while legal battles in Texas and North Carolina likely would garner a lot of attention, state-level lawsuits could soon be overshadowed by the U.S. Supreme Court. In June, the high court indicated it might review a 2012 Supreme Court of Oklahoma decision that struck down a law restricting the use of abortion-inducing drugs. The justices have asked Oklahoma’s highest court for more information and, once they receive answers to their questions, they will decide whether to take the case, Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice. If the U.S. Supreme Court does end up taking the Cline case (probably in 2014), it would be the high court’s first major abortion ruling since 2007, when it upheld a federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Just over half of Americans (54% in a July 2013 Pew Research poll) support keeping abortion legal in all or most cases. And nearly two-thirds oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a right to abortion at least during the first three months of pregnancy, according to a January 2013 Pew Research poll. At the same time, most Americans are less supportive of legalized abortion later in pregnancy. A December 2012 USA Today/Gallup survey found that majorities say that abortion should be illegal during the second (64%) and third (80%) trimesters of pregnancy.","Just over half of Americans ( 54 % in a July 2013 Pew Research poll ) support keeping abortion legal in all or most cases .

There is broad agreement among the public that it is harder to be a parent today – especially a mother – than it was in the 1970s or 1980s. Fully 70% of the public says it is more difficult to be a mother today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, while somewhat fewer (60%) say the same about being a father. A national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb.16-March 14 among 2,020 Americans, finds a widespread belief that today’s parents are not measuring up to the standard that parents set a generation ago. Mothers are seen as having the more difficult job, but they are also judged more harshly than are fathers. More than half of Americans (56%) say that mothers are doing a worse job today than mothers did 20 or 30 years ago. By comparison, somewhat fewer people (47%) say fathers are doing a worse job than fathers did 20 or 30 years ago. The biggest challenge in raising children today, according to parents and non-parents alike, is dealing with the outside influences of society. Nearly four-in-ten Americans (38%) list societal factors when asked in an open-ended format to name the biggest challenge for parents today. Among the top specific concerns mentioned are drugs and alcohol, peer pressure, and the impact of television and other media. Beyond societal influences, other perceived challenges in raising children include teaching morals and values, maintaining discipline, handling the financial aspects of childrearing, and dealing with the educational system. The views of mothers and fathers are similar when it comes to the challenges parents face today. Societal factors – including drugs and alcohol, peer pressure, and entertainment media – are the top concern for mothers and fathers alike. Overall, 70% of Americans say that mothers today have a more difficult job than mothers did 20 or 30 years ago. Fewer than one-in-five (17%) say the job of motherhood is about the same as it was then, while 11% say it is easier today. By comparison, 60% believe that it is more difficult to be a father than it was 20 or 30 years ago. About a quarter (26%) say fatherhood is about the same as it was a generation ago, while 12% say it is easier. Men and women express similar views about the difficulty of being a mother or father today compared with the past. However, there are age differences in men’s opinions about the difficulty of being a father today. Fully 70% of men ages 50-64 say being a father is more difficult today, compared with 59% of men ages 30-49, and just 46% of men under age 30. Fathers today get higher grades than mothers for their performance, especially from women. Overall, 47% of Americans say fathers of children under the age of 18 are now doing a worse job as parents than fathers did 20 or 30 years ago; this compares with 56% who say mothers are doing a worse job. About one-in-five (21%) say today’s fathers are doing a better job compared with fathers a generation ago; far fewer (9%) say that today’s mothers are doing a better job than their predecessors 20 or 30 years ago. The gender gap in evaluations of fathers is substantial. A solid majority of men (55%) say today’s fathers are doing a worse job than did fathers a generation ago, but just 40% of women agree. Most women say that today’s fathers are now doing a better job (27%), or at least as good a job (29%), as fathers did 20 or 30 years ago. Women are much harder on themselves – 54% say today’s mothers are doing a worse job when compared with mothers 20 or 30 years ago. Among men, the fathers of adult children and those who are not parents are the most critical of today’s dads. In each case, 60% say that today’s fathers are doing a worse job than the previous generation of fathers. Dads with children under age 18 have a more positive view of contemporary fathers: 47% say today’s dads are doing a worse job; 20% say they are doing a better job; and 29% say they are doing about the same job as fathers 20 or 30 years ago. There also is a substantial racial gap in evaluations of today’s fathers. Two-thirds of African Americans (67%) say that today’s fathers are doing a worse job than fathers did 20 or 30 years ago; just 44% of whites agree. Only about one-in-ten blacks (11%) say today’s fathers are doing a better job than did fathers a generation ago, compared with 24% of whites. The racial gap is even larger among women. White women are nearly three times more likely than black women to say fathers are doing a better job today than in the 1970s and 1980s (32% vs. 11% respectively). Women’s views about how well mothers are doing their job have changed little over the past 10 years. In a 1997 Pew Research Center survey of women, a majority (56%) said that mothers of children under age 18 were doing a worse job as parents than mothers did 20 or 30 years ago; in the current survey, 54% of women express this view. As was the case 10 years ago, middle-aged women are more critical of today’s moms than are younger women. Fully 66% of women ages 50-64 say today’s mothers are doing a worse job. This compares with just 41% of women younger than 30, 56% of women ages 30-49, and 48% of women ages 65 and older. Religious affiliation also influences views on motherhood. White evangelical Protestants are among the most critical of the job today’s mothers are doing. More than two-thirds of white evangelicals (68%) say moms are doing a worse job today when compared with mothers 20-30 years ago. This compares with 54% of white non-evangelical Protestants, 50% of white Catholics, and 47% of seculars. Most women (71%) say it is more difficult to be a mother today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. But in Pew’s 1997 motherhood survey, an even greater percentage of women expressed this view (81%). Just as older women are more likely to say today’s mothers are doing a worse job, they are also more likely to believe the job has become more difficult. Roughly eight-in-ten women ages 50-64 (81%) say it is harder to be a mother today than it was 20-30 years ago. This compares with 58% of women under age 30, 70% of women ages 30-49, and 73% of women ages 65 and older. The challenges facing parents today differ according to the ages of their children. Parents of adult children are more likely to point to societal factors, particularly drugs and alcohol, than are parents with kids under age 18. Fully 17% of parents whose kids are all over age 18 say drugs and alcohol are the biggest challenge in raising children today. This compares with only 4% of parents of younger children. Even among those with teenage children (ages 13-18), just 5% cite drugs or alcohol as the biggest challenge today. The challenges of balancing work and family life and finding enough time to spend with children are bigger issues for parents with children ages 18 and younger than they are for parents whose kids are grown (14% vs. 6%, respectively). Religious views and practices also influence opinions about parenting today, especially among parents with children under age 18. Among parents of children ages 18 and younger, 42% who attend religious services at least once a week cite societal factors as the biggest challenge in raising kids today. This compares with 29% of those who seldom or never attend church. In addition to general concerns about society, parents who attend services at least weekly are much more likely to mention television and other media as the biggest parenting challenges than do parents who seldom or never attend (10% vs. 3%).","Most women ( 71 % ) say it is more difficult to be a mother today than it was 20 or 30 years ago .

However, when asked about the priorities for policy toward illegal immigration, more Americans say better border security and a path to citizenship should be given equal priority than favor either approach individually. The new national survey, conducted August 9-16 among 2,010 adults, also finds that a large majority (76%) says that undocumented immigrants are as hard-working and honest as U.S. citizens, while 67% say they are no more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes. The survey also finds continued public opposition to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border: 61% oppose this proposal, which is little changed from earlier this year. Overall, 29% of the public prioritizes “creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements,” while (24%) say the focus should be on “better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws.” However, when given the option, a 45% plurality does say that both should be given equal priority. In 2014, approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States, according to preliminary Pew Research Center estimates based on government data – a population that has largely remained stable since 2009. Undocumented immigrants from Mexico make up the largest share of this population, though the number of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the U.S. has declined since 2007. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 41% say better border security and stronger law enforcement should be the focus in dealing with illegal immigration; about as many (45%), however, say that both stronger law enforcement and a path to citizenship should be given equal priority. Just 12% say creating a way for those in the U.S. illegally to become citizens should be the main priority. And among Democrats, while 43% call for a focus on creating a way for immigrants here illegally to become citizens, a comparable share (47%) think both approaches should be given equal priority. Only 9% think better border security alone should be the priority. However, when pushed to choose a single focus, those who think both should be given equal weight tend to fall in line with the preferred positions of others in their party. Overall, 69% of Republicans say stronger law enforcement is the bigger priority, while fewer (27%) say the country should prioritize a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally. Among Democrats, the reverse is true: An overwhelming majority (79%) prioritize a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally, if they have to choose one approach, while 20% think stronger law enforcement and border security should be the priority. The current findings are in keeping with recent years, when pluralities have said both approaches to immigration policy – enhanced security and a path to citizenship – should be equally prioritized, though this is the first time a slightly larger share has preferred creating a path to citizenship to enhancing security (29% vs. 24%). Among the public overall, 71% say undocumented immigrants living in the United States mostly fill jobs citizens do not want, while just 24% say they mostly take jobs citizens want. About three-quarters of Americans (76%) say undocumented immigrants are “as honest and hard-working” as U.S. citizens, while 67% say they are no more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes. As with views of immigration policy priorities, partisans differ in views of undocumented immigrants. Yet majorities of both Democrats (79%) and Republicans (63%) say that those who are in the U.S. illegally mostly take jobs U.S. citizens don’t want. Majorities in both parties also say undocumented immigrants are as honest and hard-working as U.S. citizens (87% of Democrats, 65% of Republicans). There is a sharper divide in perceptions of criminality among undocumented immigrants. By a wide margin (80% to 15%), Democrats say those in the U.S. illegally are no more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes. Among Republicans, about half (52%) say undocumented immigrants are not more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes, but 42% say they are – more than double the share of Democrats who say this. Hispanics overwhelmingly think undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. are as honest and hardworking as American citizens (86%), and that they fill jobs that American citizens do not want (79%); and Hispanics are somewhat more likely than white and black Americans to express these views. Similarly, more Hispanics than whites think undocumented immigrants are no more likely than American citizens to commit serious crimes: Nearly three-quarters of Hispanics think this (74%), compared with two-thirds of whites. Most Americans today continue to oppose building a wall along the entire border with Mexico: 61% express opposition to the wall, while 36% are in favor. These attitudes have changed little over the past year. Differences across demographic and political groups remain stark. While more whites say they are opposed (54%) than say they are in favor (43%) of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, they are far less likely than blacks and Hispanics to oppose the proposed wall. Roughly three-quarters of both blacks (76%) and Hispanics (76%) say they oppose the proposal, while just about one-in-five favor the wall. Partisan differences in opinion also are wide: A 63% majority of Republicans and Republican leaners support building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, while 34% stand opposed to it. By contrast, an overwhelming share of Democrats (84%) are opposed to the wall, while just 14% are in favor. The differences between registered voters who support Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in their characterizations of undocumented immigrants, support for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and priorities for dealing with illegal immigration largely mirror partisan differences on these issues. But among Trump backers in particular, there are some notable differences in these views by strength of support for the candidate. Half of all Trump supporters say undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. are more likely than American citizens to commit serious crimes. However, 59% of Trump supporters who support him strongly say this, compared with 42% of those who do not support him strongly. Similarly, while fewer than three-in-ten Trump backers who only moderately support the candidate think that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs American citizens would like to have (29%), these views are somewhat more prevalent among those who support Trump strongly (41%). There are only modest differences in views of undocumented immigrants between those who support Clinton strongly and those who do so only moderately. Similarly, a proposed border wall draws support from 91% of those who support Trump strongly, compared with 67% of those who do not. Clinton backers are solidly opposed regardless of strength of support for her candidacy. Fully 88% of Clinton supporters express opposition, compared with 10% who are in favor of a wall along the entire border with Mexico.","But among Trump backers in particular , there are some notable differences in these views by strength of support for the candidate .

But the public takes a more expansive view of the court’s agenda. Indeed, about as many Americans rate the rights of detained terrorist suspects as a very important issue for the Supreme Court as say that about abortion. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, conducted before Roberts was nominated, finds that abortion is far more important to ideologically committed partisans at either end of the political spectrum than to moderates and independents. The general public also continues to express somewhat ambivalent views on abortion ­ in contrast to conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. A consistent majority of Americans (65%) are opposed to overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman’s right to abortion. But most Americans also favor restrictions on abortion. Nearly three-quarters (73%) favor requiring women under age 18 to get parental consent before being allowed to get an abortion. This ambivalence is reflected in opinions on the overall availability of abortion. About a third (35%) say abortion should be generally available, but 23% favor stricter limits on abortion and 31% favor making it illegal except in cases of rape, incest or to save a woman’s life. Only about one-in-ten (9%) say abortion should never be permitted. Moreover, while nearly six-in-ten (59%) think it would be a good thing to reduce the number of abortions in the U.S., one-third (33%) say they don’t feel this way. The new study ­ based on separate surveys conducted July 13-17 among 1,502 adults, and July 7-17 among 2,000 adults ­ finds that the public’s views on social issues are complex, defying easy categorization. But religion plays a pivotal role in many of these issues, ranging from stem cell research to gay marriage. The survey finds continuing strong public support for stem cell research. By nearly two-to-one (57%-30%), the public believes that it is more important to conduct stem cell research that may result in new medical cures than to not destroy the potential life of embryos involved in such research. Support for stem cell research has been growing among major religious groups ­ with the notable exception of white evangelical Protestants. Only about a third of white evangelicals (32%) support such research, compared with large majorities of seculars (77%), mainline Protestants (70%) and white Catholics (61%). A clear majority of the public (68%) continues to support the death penalty for persons convicted or murder, but only 37% think the death penalty should be applied to people who committed capital offenses as minors. While members of the major religious traditions differ over the death penalty generally ­ with Protestants more supportive than Catholics ­ comparable majorities of religious groups oppose the use of the death penalty for minors convicted of murder. The public remains divided over how far physicians should be allowed to go in ending the lives of terminally ill patients. About half (51%) favor letting doctors give such patients the means with which to end their lives, but there is less support for physicians being allowed to help dying patients commit suicide (44%). And while a majority of Americans (53%) oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, support for gay marriage is at its highest point since July 2003. For the first time, a majority (53%) favors permitting gays and lesbians to enter into legal arrangements that would give them many of the same rights as married couples. The general public takes varying, and at times contradictory, attitudes toward the issues that constitute the so-called “culture of life.” This also is the case for members of major religious traditions. White evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly adopt a pro-life stance on abortion: 68% believe abortion should not be permitted at all, or should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the woman’s life. A smaller majority of white evangelicals (58%) oppose making it legal for doctors to give terminally ill patients the means to end their lives. In the case of stem cell research, half of white evangelicals say it is more important to avoid destroying the potential life of human embryos than to conduct stem cell research that may lead to new medical cures. At the same time, white evangelicals strongly support the death penalty for those convicted of murder; just 15% oppose the death penalty. White Catholics also have inconsistent attitudes on life issues. Roughly four-in-ten take a pro-life stance on abortion (43%) and in opposing physicians being permitted to help dying patients to end their lives (42%). Just three-in-ten white Catholics (29%) say it is more important to avoid destroying the potential life of human embryos in stem cell research than to conduct research that may result in new medical cures. And about the same number (27%) oppose the death penalty. For their part, seculars overwhelmingly dissent from pro-life positions on abortion, stem cell research and end-of-life questions. More seculars than white evangelicals or mainline Protestants oppose the death penalty for convicted murderers; still, only about three-in-ten (29%) express this view. Among the possible issues facing the Supreme Court, abortion is viewed as very important by large numbers of liberal Democrats (80%) and conservative Republicans (73%). White evangelical Protestants also place great emphasis on this issue (75%). For liberal Democrats, no other issue rivals abortion in importance. But conservatives and white evangelicals rate several issues highly. While three-quarters of white evangelicals view abortion as very important, nearly as many place great importance on court rulings on the rights of detained terrorist suspects (69%), and whether to permit religious displays on government property (68%). Abortion is a major issue for those at either end of the political spectrum, but it also is viewed as very important by younger women. Roughly three-quarters (76%) of women under age 50 rate abortion as a very important issue for the court; far fewer males in that age group (58%) see abortion as a high priority. Women under age 50 also are far more likely than older women to attach great importance to possible court rulings on abortion. Through more than 30 years of attention to abortion in policy debates and Supreme Court nominations, public opinion on the issue has remained remarkably stable. This is the case with both views of the availability of abortion, and of the Roe v. Wade decision establishing women’s right to abortion. (For more on attitudes toward Roe v. Wade, see “Supreme Court’s Image Declines as Nomination Battle Looms,” June 15). The overall pattern of opinion is similar on both issues. Members of both political parties are divided in views of the availability of abortion. Nearly two-thirds of liberal Democrats (64%) believe abortion should be generally available to those who want it. That compares with only about a third of moderate and conservative Democrats (34%). About one-in-five conservative Republicans (22%) believe abortion should not be permitted at all; just 1% of moderate and liberal Republicans agree. And roughly twice as many conserva tive Republicans as GOP liberals and moderates say abortion should be banned, or allowed only in cases of incest, rape or to protect the life of the woman (71% vs. 36%). There also are wide differences among religious groups over this question. Most seculars (60%) believe abortion should be generally available, and a plurality of white mainline Protestants agree. About two-thirds of white evangelicals (68%) believe abortion should not be permitted or allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the woman’s life. White Catholics are deeply divided over abortion, with about three-in-ten (31%) it should be generally available, and 43% saying it should be banned or only legal in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. A plurality of college graduates (46%) say abortion should be generally available, while just 29% of those with a high school education express that view. But there are no significant gender differences in these opinions. And while women under age 50 are much more likely than men in that age group to view abortion as a very important issue for the Supreme Court, they hold similar views concerning the availability of abortion. The public also is deeply split over the moral implications of abortion. A plurality (41%) thinks abortion is wrong in some circumstances; 29% feel abortion is morally wrong in nearly all circumstances; and about a quarter (26%) believe that abortion is not a moral issue. A large majority (60%) of those who believe that abortion is morally wrong in nearly all circumstances support overturning the Roe v. Wade decision. In contrast, 91% those who believe abortion is not a moral issue overwhelmingly favor continued access to abortion. Those with mixed views on the morality of abortion strongly oppose overturning Roe v. Wade. But many with this opinion favor stricter limits on abortion, with roughly a third (35%) saying abortion should be against the law except in cases of rape, incest, and to save the woman’s life. Regardless of their views on the legality of abortion, most Americans (59%) believe it would be a good thing to reduce the number of abortions. However, a sizable minority (33%) disagrees. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (72%) say it would be good to reduce the number of abortions, compared with smaller majorities of independents (55%) and Democrats (51%). Those who are married are much more likely than unmarried people to say it would be a good thing to reduce the number of abortions (by 66%-50%). And a narrow majority of seculars (51%) feel it would not be a good thing to decrease the number of abortions. As has been the case for more than a decade, most of the public favors requiring women under age 18 to obtain the consent of at least one parent before being allowed to get an abortion. Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) support such a requirement, while just 22% are opposed. Like other opinions on abortion, views on this issue have changed little over the years ­ in 1992, an identical percentage favored requiring young women to obtain parental consent before being permitted to get an abortion. Large majorities in all major religious groups ­ and fully two-thirds of seculars (67%) ­ believe that women under 18 should receive parental consent before being able to obtain an abortion. However, liberal Democrats are divided on this issue; 50% favor requiring young women to get the consent of at least one parent before getting an abortion, but 44% are opposed. By contrast, there is strong sentiment in favor of requiring parental consent among moderate and conservative Democrats (72%), and overwhelming support among conservative Republicans (94%) and moderate and liberal Republicans (81%). There is less public agreement on allowing women to obtain the so-called “morning after pill” without a doctor’s prescription. Anti-abortion groups argue that the morning after pill induces an abortion because the drug can cause the body to reject a newly fertilized egg; supporters of abortion rights say the pill constitutes emergency contraception. Most Americans (52%) favor allowing women to get the morning after pill without a doctor’s prescription, while 37% are opposed. Groups that are most supportive of keeping abortion generally available ­ seculars and liberal Democrats ­ also strongly favor allowing easier access to the morning after pill (77% of seculars, 72% of liberal Democrats). Similarly, the same groups that strongly oppose abortion ­ conservative Republicans and white evangelical Protestants ­ also oppose making it easier for women to get the morning after pill (58% of conservative Republicans, 52% of white evangelicals). There also is a modest gender divide in views of the morning after pill, with men somewhat more supportive than women of allowing greater access to this drug (56% of men vs. 48% of women). Debates over sex education in schools often pit abstinence instruction against providing students information on birth control methods. But the public sees no conflict in pursuing both of these approaches: 78% favor allowing public schools to provide students with birth control information; nearly as many (76%) believe schools should teach teenagers to abstain from sex until marriage. Solid majorities in every major religious group say schools should be allowed to provide students with information on birth control methods. But a sizable minority of white evangelical Protestants (30%) are opposed. White evangelicals also are among the most supportive of having public schools teach teenagers to abstain from sex until marriage. Seculars express the greatest reservations to schools promoting abstinence; 62% support that approach, while roughly a third (34%) are opposed. The youngest Americans ­ those ages 18-24 ­ are highly supportive of schools both promoting abstinence and providing information about birth control. Roughly eight-in-ten (83%) favor schools providing birth control information, while 75% think schools should teach teenagers to abstain from sex until marriage. Public awareness of, and support for, stem cell research appears to be leveling off, after showing significant gains from 2002 to 2004. Currently, 48% say they have heard a lot about the issue, which is little changed since last December (47%). More Americans continue to say it is more important to conduct stem cell research that might result in new medical cures than to avoid destroying the potential life of human embryos involved in such research (by 57% to 30%). That is about the same level of support for stem cell research as last December, but up modestly since August 2004 (52%). Three years ago, in March 2002, just 43% supported stem cell research. As in the past, greater awareness of the stem cell debate is associated with support for stem cell research. Roughly two-thirds of those who have heard a lot about the issue (68%) believe it is more important to conduct stem cell research than to not destroy the potential life of embryos. That compares with 49% of those who have heard a little about the issue, and just a third of those who are unfamiliar with the debate over stem cell research. Three years ago, Americans were only dimly aware of ­ and fairly evenly divided over ­ stem cell research. Since then, support for this research has grown among most demographic and political groups. The shift has been most striking among middle-aged Americans (ages 50-64), high school graduates, mainline Protestants and white Catholics, and liberal Democrats. There are some exceptions to this pattern, however. Just a third of conservative Republicans say it is more important to conduct stem cell research, virtually the same percentage as in March 2002 (32%). Over the same period, moderate and liberal Republicans have become more supportive of stem cell research; as a result, the gap between conservative Republicans and GOP moderates and liberals has grown from 16 points to 29 points. White evangelical Protestants also remain opposed to stem cell research. About a third (32%) favor such research today, while 50% are opposed. Three years ago, 26% of evangelicals backed stem cell research. Supporters and opponents of stem cell research draw on very different sources when thinking about the issue. Roughly half (52%) of opponents say their religious beliefs are the biggest influence on their thinking, while 13% cite what they have seen or read in the media and 12% mention their education. Conservative Republican opponents are especially likely (70%) to cite religion as their main influence, as are evangelical Protestant opponents (69%). Among supporters, 31% say the biggest influence on their thinking is the media, and 28% mention their education. Just 7% say religion is the most important influence. College graduates (44%) who favor the research are particularly likely to name education as their primary influence, as are pro-research liberal Democrats (43%). A narrow majority of Americans (51%) favor making it legal for doctors to give terminally ill patients the means to end their lives. As in past Pew surveys, there is less support (44%) for physicians actually aiding such patients in committing suicide. Attitudes on these end-of-life issues have changed very little since July 2003. There continue to be clear differences among major religious groups in views of how far physicians should be permitted to go in assisting terminally ill patients to end their lives. Majorities of seculars and white mainline Protestants favor allowing physicians to give the terminally ill the means to end their lives, and to assist such patients in committing suicide. White Catholics are divided over these issues, while white evangelical Protestants are widely opposed to doctors taking any measures to help terminally ill patients to end their lives. Men also are more supportive than women of allowing physicians to end the lives of their terminally ill patients. A majority of men (55%) favor making it legal for doctors to give such patients the means to end their lives; 47% of women agree. There is a comparable gender gap in views of physician-assisted suicide. Four months after Congress passed legislation transferring jurisdiction in the Terri Schiavo case to the federal courts, the overwhelming majority of Americans (74%) indicate that Congress should not have involved itself in the matter. White evangelical Protestants are more supportive of Congress’s actions than are members of other religious groups, conservatives are more supportive than moderates and liberals, and Republicans are more supportive than Democrats and independents. But even among these groups, large majorities (69% of white evangelicals, 68% of conservatives and 65% of Republicans) believe that Congress should have stayed out of the case. Roughly two-thirds of Americans (68%) support the death penalty for people convicted of murder, up slightly from two years ago (64%). However, public support for the death penalty was greater in the late 1990s (74% in 1999). But most Americans continue to oppose the death penalty for minors. By 54%-37%, the public opposes the death penalty for those who have been convicted of murder when they are under age 18. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in such cases, citing a “national consensus” on the issue. The pattern of opinion on applying the death penalty to minors is quite different than for the death penalty generally. For instance, there are only modest gender differences, at most, in support for the death penalty (70% of men, 66% of women). But there is a sizable gender gap in attitudes toward the death penalty for those convicted of murder who are under age 18; 47% of men support the death penalty for minors, compared with only about a quarter of women (27%). And while there are significant differences among religious groups in views of the overall application of the death penalty, there is striking agreement in opinions on the death penalty for those under age 18. Only about four-in-ten white evangelicals, mainline Protestants, white Catholics and seculars favor the death penalty under these circumstances. Modest Increase in Gay Marriage Support Public support for allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally has rebounded a bit after declining between 2003 and 2004. Today, 36% of Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry, up from 32% in December 2004. The percentage favoring gay civil unions has risen as well. Currently, 53% favor allowing gays and lesbians to enter into legal arrangements providing them with many of the same rights as married couples; that compares with 48% last August. Support for gay marriage and gay civil unions has increased slightly among most religious groups. However, support for civil unions has increased significantly among white evangelical Protestants, from 26% in December 2004 to 35% today. This increase, however, is concentrated primarily among low-commitment evangelicals, a majority of whom now support civil unions. There remain substantial divisions in views of gay marriage and civil unions across political groups. Nearly seven-in-ten liberals support gay marriage and eight-in-ten support civil unions, up from 59% and 70%, respectively in 2004. Among conservatives, however, support for gay marriage stands at 14%, and support for civil unions has actually declined slightly (from 35% in 2004 to 31% today). Similarly, Democrats and independents are more supportive of gay marriage and civil unions today than they were a year ago, and remain much more supportive of both proposals than are Republicans. In line with these findings, there has also been a slight decline (from 35% in August 2004 to 29% today) in the number of Americans expressing support for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.","Public support for allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally has rebounded a bit after declining between 2003 and 2004 .

And nearly 690,000 of these immigrants are currently enrolled in the program, according to new data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The program’s future is uncertain after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of plans to phase it out. The U.S. government is not accepting new DACA applications and will stop accepting renewal applications on Oct. 5. Those currently enrolled in the program retain their benefits, which last for a total of two years. Trump has urged Congress to pass legislation by March 2018 that would give legal status to unauthorized immigrants enrolled in DACA, and some members of Congress have said they plan to propose legislation along those lines. (DACA enrollees whose benefits expire after March 5, 2018, will be the first to be dropped from the program.) In the new data, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has for the first time released detailed demographic information about those currently enrolled in DACA, a group sometimes called “Dreamers.” Here are some key facts about these individuals, based on the new data. About 690,000 unauthorized immigrants were enrolled in DACA as of Sept. 4. Although roughly 800,000 unauthorized immigrants have ever received benefits through DACA, about 110,000 of this group are no longer enrolled in the program. About 70,000 former DACA participants did not renew their benefits or had their renewal applications denied. Another 40,000 have adjusted their legal status and obtained green cards, which grant lawful permanent residence. (Some unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. can obtain legal status by marrying an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, obtaining asylum, or receiving certain types of visas such as those given to victims of a crime, among other ways.) To qualify for DACA, enrollees must meet certain conditions, such as being enrolled in high school or having a high school diploma or GED equivalent, and not being convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors. Current DACA recipients come from around the world, but more than nine-in-ten were born in Latin America. Mexico is by far the top country of origin for active DACA recipients (548,000), followed by El Salvador (25,900), Guatemala (17,700) and Honduras (16,100). A significant number of DACA recipients also hail from Peru (7,420), South Korea (7,310), Brazil (5,780), Ecuador (5,460), Colombia (5,020) and Argentina (3,970). By region, almost all current DACA recipients were born in Mexico or Central or South America (648,430, or 94%). Another 18,940 (3%) were born in Asia, followed by the Caribbean (8,350), Europe (5,190) and Africa (4,240). Three-quarters of DACA recipients live in 20 U.S. metro areas. With 89,900 DACA recipients, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area had the largest number of active enrollees as of Sept. 4. That was nearly twice as many enrollees as the next largest metro area, New York-Newark-Jersey City (47,200). Other top metro areas include Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington (36,700), Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land (35,800) and Chicago-Naperville-Elgin (34,100). The top metro areas of current DACA recipients are similar to those of the nation’s unauthorized immigrant population as a whole. Nearly half (45%) of current DACA recipients live in just two states: California (29%) and Texas (16%). Illinois (5%), New York (5%), Florida (4%) and Arizona (4%) also have significant populations of active DACA recipients. Two-thirds of DACA recipients are ages 25 or younger, and a majority are women. Women make up a slight majority (53%) of active DACA recipients, while 47% are men, according to the tabulations from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The average age of “Dreamers” enrolled in DACA is 24 years old. Those 25 and younger make up two-thirds of active DACA recipients – 29% are ages 16-20 and 37% are ages 21-25. About a quarter (24%) are ages 26-30, while one-in-ten (11%) are ages 31-36. (No DACA recipients are older than 36 because the program required applicants to have entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and have been under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.) Most current DACA recipients (83%) were unmarried at the time of their most recent application. By contrast, 15% were married and 1% were divorced. (Less than 1% were widowed.)

About one-in-six adults (15%) say they usually try technology products before others do. Using people’s answers to these six questions, Pew Research Center created an “early adopter index” that classifies Americans’ preferences for new technology products or familiar ones into three tiers: strong, medium and weak. Some 28% of Americans hold strong preferences for being early adopters and trying new technology products, 45% score at or near the mean of the index, and 26% score low on the index, indicating a stronger preference for familiar technology products. When the six questions are taken individually, the answers suggest a tilt toward the comfort of the familiar, with a committed minority of the more adventurous mixed in. Compared with seniors, younger adults are more inclined to like trying new technology products. These age differences are in keeping with previous Pew Research Center surveys that found younger adults more likely to be interested in science and technology and more likely to own technology products such as smartphones, tablets and computers. And while men and women have similar preferences, index scores suggest that men under age 50 are more likely than either older men or women at any age to prefer new technology products. Technology products have typically come on the market with a high price tag that is out of reach for many consumers. Thus, not surprisingly, adults with family incomes of at least $150,000 annually also tend to express a stronger preference for early technology adoption on this summary index (39% do so) compared with those at middle- and lower-income levels. Those with higher family income are also more likely to be internet users and to own cellphones, tablets and laptop or desktop computers. There are also modest associations between two of the Big Five personality dimensions — openness to experience and extraversion — and preferences toward new technology. Americans with higher openness to experience are more likely to prefer early technology adoption; a third of those more open to experience have a high score on the index, compared with a quarter among those who are lower. Extroverts are also more likely than introverts to strongly prefer new technology products on this measure (31% for those who score high on extroversion compared with 24% for those who score low). The survey also asked a similar set of questions about food preferences to test whether people’s preferences for the new are also found in other kinds of choices people make. Using a parallel set of six questions, we classified Americans into those with strong, medium and weak “food adopter” preferences. The results were somewhat different than those about technology. On this index, some 37% of U.S. adults have strong preferences toward being early adopters of food products, 38% are in the middle, and 25% have weak early-adopter preferences, indicating they prefer familiar food products. There are similar patterns in which Americans are most likely to have strong early adopter preferences for food products. For example, as was the case with new technology, younger adults across the age spectrum are more likely than those ages 65 and older to express a preference for trying new food products. Some 16% of U.S. adults have strong preferences for trying both new food and technology products. Another 12% of adults have strong early-adopter preferences for technology, but not for food products. Personality also matters. Those with high openness to new experiences are more inclined to have strong preferences for trying both new food and technology products (21% do so among those with higher openness to experience compared with 13% among those with lower openness). See the topline questionnaire and methodology for this survey.","Compared with seniors , younger adults are more inclined to like trying new technology products .

In fact, the story evokes a typical response from the public when compared with news interest in past Washington scandals. Amid calls for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales’ resignation, the news media’s coverage of the story outstripped public interest. Most Americans remained focused on the Iraq war and the problems facing returning soldiers. Overall, 19% of the public paid very close attention to news about the fired U.S. attorneys and 8% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. The news media devoted 16% of its coverage overall to the firings – an eight-fold increase over the week of March 5 – making it the most covered story of the week. Public interest increased as well though at a lower rate. Democrats followed the U.S. attorneys story more closely than Republicans (23% vs. 15%, respectively, followed it very closely).This story did generate more public interest than the recent verdict in the Scooter Libby trial – one of last week’s most covered news stories. Only 13% followed that story very closely. Looking at past Washington scandals involving senior government officials, the firing of eight U.S. attorneys generated an average amount of interest from the public. It is on par with Whitewater, the HUD scandal of the late 1980s, Trent Lott’s resignation as Senate Majority Leader, the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, Tom Delay’s indictment for campaign finance violations and the savings and loan scandal of the early 1990s. While the news media focused on how Gonzales and the White House were connected to the U.S. attorney firings, the public remained intensely focused on the Iraq War. Fully 34% said they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 23% listed Iraq as the story they followed most closely last week. Nearly as many (31%) followed news about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and more general stories about problems with medical care for wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Some 17% said this was the story they followed most closely. Coverage of this story fell off somewhat from the previous week— 4% of coverage in all media sectors was devoted to this story last week vs. 6% the week of March 5. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism‘s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In other top stories this week, the steady stream of news about the 2008 presidential campaign continued. Nine percent of news coverage in all sectors was devoted to this topic. For the past two months, media coverage of the campaign has focused largely on the two leading Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. That fact has not been lost on the public, as these two campaigns are at the forefront of the public’s mind. When asked to name the candidate they’ve heard the most about in the news lately, 37% named Clinton and another 24% named Barack Obama. Mentions of all other candidates were in single digits: 3% or fewer named John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John Edwards. Women were somewhat more likely than men to name Clinton (40% vs. 34%, respectively). Even so, she was the top pick of both men and women. Clinton and Obama overshadowed the other candidates even among Republicans. Nearly one-third of Republicans named Clinton when asked which candidate they had heard the most about in the news lately, another 27% named Obama. Ten percent of Republicans named a GOP candidate: 8% named Giuliani, 6% named McCain and less than 1% named Romney. Among Democrats, 48% named Clinton and 26% named Obama. Only 1% named Edwards. Overall, public interest in the campaign fell off somewhat from previous weeks while coverage remained about the same. Fifteen percent of the public followed news about the candidates very closely last week, down from 24% and 19% the previous two weeks. Roughly one-in-ten Americans named the campaign as the story they followed most closely. Democrats paid closer attention to campaign news than did Republicans – 22% vs. 12%, respectively, followed this story very closely. Recent news about the stock market attracted a modest audience – 18% of the public followed this story very closely while 8% said it was the story they followed most closely. Two weeks earlier, when stocks took a dramatic tumble, the public was following the market somewhat more closely. Stock market happenings drew in a distinct audience – Republicans and men were among the most likely to pay close attention to this story. In addition, the income gap on this story is substantial. Fully 57% of those with annual household incomes of $75,000 or higher followed news about the stock market very or fairly closely. This compares with 40% of those making between $50,000 and $75,000, and fewer than 30% of those making less than $50,000 a year. Roughly one-in-ten Americans (11%) paid very close attention to President Bush’s recent trip to Latin America. This is on a par with previous Bush trips in terms of public interest. Three percent of media coverage for the week was devoted to Bush’s trip. With regard to news coverage of the president more generally, 33% of the public believes the media is being unfair to the Bush administration, 53% say the media is being fair, and another 14% has no opinion. Over the course of his presidency, the perception that Bush is being treated unfairly by the media has grown gradually. At the beginning of 2001, only 19% said the media was being unfair to the president. By the summer of 2003, 24% held this view, and by the fall of 2005, the number had increased to 31%. Perceptions of media coverage of Bill Clinton’s administration followed a similar trajectory. Early on in his first term, a strong majority of the public (72%) said news organizations were being fair to the Clinton administration while only 17% saw them as unfair. By the spring of 1994, 36% thought the press was being unfair to Clinton, and by September, 1998 that number had risen to 40%. Not surprisingly, the partisan gap on this question is substantial. Only 26% of Republicans believe Bush is being treated fairly by the news media, fully 65% say he’s being treated unfairly. Among Democrats, 75% think news organizations are being fair to Bush while 13% say they are being unfair. Independents are squarely in the middle: 52% see the media as fair to Bush, 33% say they are unfair. The opinions of Republicans have changed dramatically over the course of Bush’s presidency. In July 2003, Republicans believed on balance that the media was being fair to Bush – 50% vs. 38% who said unfair. Independents have also become more critical of press coverage of Bush over the past four years. The opinions of Democrats have remained much more stable. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Sunday through Friday) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

About half (48%) of Hispanics overall said they had serious concerns about their place in the country, according to a Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults fielded in December 2019. This was particularly true of Hispanic U.S. adults who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, 60% of whom held this view compared with 26% of Hispanics who identify as or lean Republican. Conversely, 72% of Republican Hispanics said they were confident about their place in America, compared with 36% of Democratic Hispanics. The nation’s Latino population reached 60.6 million in 2019, accounting for about 18% of the national U.S. population. Of the nation’s 41 million Hispanic adults, roughly half are immigrants and about another 23% are the U.S.-born adult children of immigrant parents. About 62% of Latino registered voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 34% affiliate with or lean to the Republican Party. While voicing their concerns over their place in U.S. society, 38% of Hispanic adults said they had personally experienced discrimination in the previous year. More recently, many Black and Asian Americans have reported experiencing discrimination amid the COVID-19 outbreak, while fewer Hispanics said the same, according to a Center survey conducted in June. Shortly before the outbreak, about four-in-ten Latinos (38%) said they had experienced discrimination in the 12 months prior to the December 2019 survey, such as being criticized for speaking Spanish in public or being told to go back to their home country. At the same time, a smaller share (30%) of Latinos said someone had expressed support for them because of their Latino background. More than a quarter (28%) of Hispanics said they had experienced another kind of discrimination or been treated unfairly due to their background. Meanwhile, about a fifth said they had been called offensive names (21%), been criticized for speaking Spanish in public (20%) or been told to go back to their home country (19%). Still, some Hispanics said they had become more public in recent years about expressing their identities, with those who align with the Democratic Party more often showing pride in being Hispanic and Republicans more often expressing pride in being American. Overall, Latinos hold negative views of President Donald Trump, with views sharply divided along party lines, according to a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted later in June. About two-thirds of Hispanics (69%) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, including 51% who disapprove very strongly. The 28% of Hispanics who approve of Trump includes 17% who approve strongly. Views of Trump’s job performance among Latinos are tied to partisanship – 86% of Latino Democrats disapprove of Trump’s job performance, with 65% disapproving very strongly. Meanwhile, 67% of Latino Republicans approve of Trump’s job performance, including 45% who approve very strongly. When asked in December 2019 about the effect Trump’s policies have had on Hispanics, about two-thirds of Hispanic adults (69%) said they had been harmful, with similar shares of immigrants and the U.S. born saying so. Far more Hispanic Democrats (85%) than Hispanic Republicans (38%) said Trump administration policies had been harmful to Hispanics. One of the Trump administration’s top priorities has been to reduce the number of immigrants who enter the country. The administration has issued several orders to tighten restrictions for legal immigration and close U.S. borders amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some Hispanics say they have changed how they outwardly show their identities over the past five years, a period that roughly starts with the launch of Trump’s presidential campaign. Before the outbreak, over a third (35%) of Hispanics said they more often outwardly express their Hispanic identity than five years ago by speaking Spanish in public (24%), talking about their pride in being Hispanic (25%) or wearing clothing that shows their Hispanic heritage (10%). Meanwhile, a similar share of Hispanics (33%) said they more often express their U.S. identity by speaking only English in public (21%), talking about their pride in being American (17%) or wearing clothing that shows their U.S. pride (11%). Public expressions of identity differed greatly by party affiliation. About four-in-ten (44%) Hispanic Republicans said they outwardly express their U.S. pride compared with five years ago. Roughly three-in-ten (29%) of Hispanic Democrats said the same. By contrast, 38% of Hispanic Democrats said they outwardly express their Hispanic identity more often than five years ago, compared with 30% of Hispanic Republicans. This pattern emerges on other measures: 29% of Hispanic Republicans said they now talk more about their pride in being American, compared with 12% of Hispanic Democrats. By contrast, more Hispanic Democrats than Hispanic Republicans said they talk more about their pride in being Hispanic, 29% vs. 19%. Similarly, Hispanics who said Trump’s policies are harmful to their group were more likely to say they have increased the outward expression of their Hispanic ethnicity (39%), compared with those who said Trump policies are helpful to Hispanics (28%). By contrast, Hispanics who said Trump policies are helpful to Hispanics were more likely to say they now express their U.S. identity more often (59%) than those who said Trump policies are harmful to the group (29%). Foreign-born Hispanics were slightly more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics to say they have increased the outward expression of their Hispanic identity (39% vs. 32% respectively). There were no significant differences between foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos in how they express their U.S. identity today compared with five years ago. Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.","Some Hispanics say they have changed how they outwardly show their identities over the past five years , a period that roughly starts with the launch of Trump ’s presidential campaign .

Some 15% also say they rely on their own research “a little” as they make major decisions. The 96% of those in the survey who said they rely on their own research a lot or a little were asked to explain in their own words what they mean by “doing their own research.” In answering this open-ended question, they cited a host of sources that often start – but do not end – with searching on the internet. Overall, 46% explained they turned to digital tools, while 25% said they turned to other people for advice. Less commonly cited strategies for self-conducted research included people relying on their prior education or life experiences (11%), reading print media (8%), and consulting religious wisdom (4%). For some, it meant letting their instincts and “gut” inform their decision. Many reported using multiple strategies when seeking advice, often depending on the type of decision they are trying to make. Several themes stood out as Americans explained in writing the way they do their own research when they make big decisions (responses edited for punctuation, spelling and clarity). “I rely on information on the internet, e.g., a move to another city made me look up geographical information, cost of living, and also info from residents of the new area and also input from friends of long standing, using their experiences.” – Woman, 77 “If I were to change jobs, enter college, etc., I would conduct research on the internet. I would search for news articles, seek out publications that evaluate the choices, and try to talk directly to experts or people with relevant experiences.” – Man, 54 “First, I will do a fairly rigorous web search, comparing multiple sources of information for both content and reliability. Afterward, I will follow up with books and other resources from the library.” – Man, 45 “All available: Web, reviews, leg work, asking questions, reviewing with my family, finding people who had the same decision to make and get their take on it.” – Man, 54 “Internet, books, articles and others’ experiences. Whatever medium contains information that is relevant and deemed reliable by me.” – Male, age 45 “My instincts. My wisdom. Google …. My gut feelings.” – Woman, 60 “I research and read up on everything and everyone involved. I use the internet and research what is available, but I trust my instincts when making decisions.” – Woman, 54 “Authoritative sources on the internet written by experts on the subject, primarily.” – Man, 48 “Talk to my parents and grandparents. I then talk to a friend who’s a subject matter expert if available. I finally move to internet research and research heavily on the internet. If any questions remain I circle back to the beginning and loop through again.” – Man, 26 “Discussions with people who have been in the same situation. Professional advice from doctors, pastors, counselors. Do research on my own via the internet.” – Woman, 72 “[I do] online research; asking friends (or persons I respect) their advice. Prayer is a key factor in any decision I make. Also, what the Bible has to say that might apply to my situation.” – Woman, 53 “Major decisions are always led with a conversation with husband. Talking with professional and going online to look at options mentioned by professional plus other alternatives. Is it in line with my faith or scripturally sound? Talking with a trusted friend.” – Woman, 65 “Look for resources at the library and I love YouTube because it provides more a personal resource.” – Woman, 39 “Google and library.” – Woman, 20 In a wrap-up comment, a 93-year-old woman respondent to the survey wrote, “I have a few [major decisions] ahead of me. Internet and children assist.” The rise of digital resources on the web and apps has occurred at a time of decreasing trust in institutions like the government, news media and higher education. The move by people to do their own research online is also taking place as the internet is allowing crowds of people to post reviews, ratings and comments of the things they purchase and experience. This internet-enabled, crowd-based activity has been described as distributed trust. The 2018 survey also asked questions about people’s use of online reviews and ratings. An overwhelming majority (93%) of Americans report reading customer reviews and ratings at least sometimes when buying a product or service for the first time. By and large, Americans have confidence that reviews and ratings can be beneficial: Majorities say reviews have at least a somewhat positive effect on consumer confidence (88% think they help a lot or some), product safety (80%) and company accountability (78%). Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.","By and large , Americans have confidence that reviews and ratings can be beneficial : Majorities say reviews have at least a somewhat positive effect on consumer confidence ( 88 % think they help a lot or some ) , product safety ( 80 % ) and company accountability ( 78 % ) .","How is the trend among Americans about the beneficial effect of ratings and ratings?","Majorities say reviews have at least a somewhat positive effect on consumer confidence ( 88 % think they help a lot or some ) , product safety ( 80 % ) and company accountability ( 78 % ) .","Majorities say reviews have at least a somewhat positive effect on consumer confidence ( 88 % think they help a lot or some ) , product safety ( 80 % ) and company accountability ( 78 % ) ."],"2127":["2127.png","Americans are divided about media coverage of protests these days % of U.S. adults who say news organizations give the compared with recent years","In the wake of last month’s marches for science and climate in Washington and around the country, Americans are divided in their support of the events’ goals and their sense of whether it will make a difference. In particular, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that most Democrats and younger adults are convinced that these public events will help the causes of scientists. By contrast, Republicans and older adults believe the marches will not raise public support for scientists, aid efforts to increase government funding of science, enhance the role of scientists in policy debates or lead to increased efforts to combat global climate change. Overall, 44% of adults think the protests, marches and demonstrations will boost public support for science, while an equal share believe the protests will make no difference and 7% believe the demonstrations will actually hurt the cause. But on this and other questions about the marches there are consistent divides along political and generational lines. For example, 61% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents believe the marches will increase public support for science, while only 22% of Republicans and those who lean Republican say the same. Instead, 60% of these Republican backers think the protests will make no difference, compared with just 32% of Democratic partisans who think that. Younger adults (ages 18 to 29) are particularly likely to think the marches will increase public support for science (55%). In contrast, 54% of seniors 65 and older believe the recent science marches will make no difference to public support for science; just 29% say the marches will help. These are some of the findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted among a nationally representative sample of 1,012 adults, ages 18 or older from May 3-7, 2017. The March for Science, which took place on April 22, stemmed from a Reddit thread made on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day. A number of groups were involved in planning the event held in Washington, D.C., and some 600 other locations around the world. The People’s Climate March was organized before the 2016 election and held April 29 to voice support for action to address global climate change. Rather than being in support of one specific policy outcome, marchers said there were a number of reasons they participated in the two science marches held in close sequence at the end of April. Americans render a split verdict about the marches and their impact, though a majority (59%) thinks that the protests will be effective in encouraging scientists to be more active in civic and public affairs. But on this and other possible impacts from these marches, there are consistent divides between political party groups: By one main measure, the marches about science have registered with Americans: They have drawn a share of public attention. Roughly six-in-ten Americans say they have heard a lot (24%) or a little (37%) about the protests, marches and demonstrations about science held this April. More than a third (37%) say they have heard nothing at all. Overall, 48% of Americans say they “support” or “strongly support” the goals of the pro-science marches, while 26% “oppose” or “strongly oppose” the goals of the demonstrations and 26% say they don’t know how they feel about them. Support for the goals of the science marches is divided by political party. Republicans and Republican leaners oppose the goals of the science marches by a 47%-25% margin; some 29% are undecided about their views. Democrats and Democratic leaners support the goals of the marches by a 68%-14% margin, with 18% undecided. People who have heard about the recent science marches are largely supportive of the protesters’ goals. Those who have heard at least a little about the recent science marches support the goals of the science marchers by a margin of 61% to 27%. Americans are closely divided on the issue of whether the marches will increase public support for science: 44% think they will help and 44% think they will make no difference. Another 7% believe they will hurt public support. Most Democrats and Democratic leaners (61%) believe the marches and demonstrations held in April will benefit public support for science. By contrast, just 22% of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP say the marches will help drive public support for science, while six-in-ten (60%) of this group believes the marches will have no impact on public support and 13% say the marches will hurt public support. While there are sizable partisan divisions on these issues, the differences between younger and older adults are also striking. When it comes to backing the goals of the protesters, 56% of those ages 18 to 29 “support” or “strongly support” the goals of the marchers, while just 36% of those 65 and older say they back the goals of the marchers. And in terms of perceived impact, 72% of those ages 18 to 29 think the marches will encourage scientists to be more active in civic affairs, compared with 47% of those ages 65 and older. Some 62% of younger adults believe the protests will raise support for government funding of science, while only 36% of those 65 and older say this. Additionally, 61% of younger adults think the protests will encourage policymakers to rely more on the advice of scientific experts, versus 43% of adults 65 and older. Younger adults are also more likely to think the protests and demonstrations will lead to public support for science: 55% of adults younger than 30 believe the recent marches and demonstrations will help public support for science, compared with 29% of those ages 65 and older. These differences by age hold even when accounting for the tendency of older adults to identify with the GOP. There are no notable demographic differences in views about the recent science protests by gender or education. President Trump’s election signaled major changes to federal policy connected with science, particularly for climate and environmental policies but also for funding science research at NASA, the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. Many in the scientific community have voiced concern about Trump’s views about science issues, particularly childhood vaccines and climate change, and have raised concerns about the appointment and role of science advisers in guiding policy decisions in the coming years. Asked whether the pro-science demonstrators were driven to act by the Trump administration’s handling of science issues, 48% say they think opposition to Trump was a major reason people participated, 22% say it was a minor reason, 17% say it was not a reason at all and 13% say they do not know. Fully 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say opposition to Trump was a major reason for marchers’ participation, compared with 36% of Republicans and Republican leaners who say this. Those following news about the recent science marches are particularly likely to believe that opposition to the new administration’s handling of science issues is a motivating factor for the recent protests. Some 55% of those who had heard at least a little about these marches say opposition to the Trump administration’s handling of science issues was a major reason for the protests, compared with 37% who had heard nothing about these science marches. When asked about news coverage of protests, marches and demonstrations these days – whether the cause is related to science or something else – 41% of Americans say the media give too much coverage to demonstrations these days compared with recent years, 31% believe the coverage is about the right amount and 24% think there is too little coverage. Here, too, there are differences in views by party and age. Fully 68% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations, while 18% think the amount of coverage has been about right and 11% say there has been too little coverage. By contrast, 43% of Democrats and Democratic leaners think there has been the right amount of coverage, 29% think there has been too little and 26% say there has been too much media coverage of demonstrations these days. Half (50%) of those ages 65 and older believe there has been too much media coverage of protests, marches and demonstrations these days; in contrast, 34% of those 18 to 29 think there has been too much coverage.","Here , too , there are differences in views by party and age .

In Asia, where most Buddhists live, different countries celebrate the occasion on different days, including April 8 in Japan, May 12 in South Korea and May 18 in India and Nepal. The holiday goes by several names, including Buddha Purnima, Vesak, Buddha Jayanti and Ikh Duichen, and is often marked by national holidays, festivals and events at Buddhist temples. Here are five facts about Buddhists: 1Buddhists made up roughly 7% of the world’s population in 2015, but they are expected to decrease to roughly 5% by 2060. This is because Buddhists have relatively low fertility rates compared with other religious groups, and they are not expected to grow significantly due to conversions or religious switching. 2Half the world’s Buddhists live in China, according to 2010 Pew Research Center estimates. Still, they make up only 18% of the country’s population. Most of the rest of the world’s Buddhists live in East and South Asia, including 13% in Thailand (where 93% of the population is Buddhist) and 9% in Japan (35% Buddhist). Only about 1.4% of the world’s Buddhists live in countries outside of Asia. Buddhism in Asia is a matter of both identity and practice. Scholars and journalists have documented that many people in Asian countries may engage in Buddhist (and other religious) practices without considering themselves part of any organized religion. 3Scholars generally agree that Siddhartha Gautama was born in what would today be Nepal and taught in what would today be India, but Buddhism is a minority faith in both countries. Only 1% of Indians and 10% of Nepalese identify as Buddhist; in both countries, the vast majority of people identify as Hindu. Indeed, since Siddhartha was born into a Hindu family, Buddhism is considered to have originated in part from the Hindu religious tradition and some Hindus revere Buddha as an incarnation of a Hindu deity. 4Buddhists make up roughly 1% of the adult population in the United States, and about two-thirds of U.S. Buddhists are Asian Americans, according to Pew Research Center estimates. Among Asian Americans, 43% of Vietnamese Americans and a quarter of Japanese Americans identify as Buddhist, with most of the rest identifying as either Christian or religiously unaffiliated. 5With a median age of 36, Buddhists are older than the world’s overall population, which has a median age of 30, according to estimates as of 2015. They also are older than people in other major religious groups, such as Muslims (median of 24), Hindus (median of 27) and Christians (median of 30). Religiously unaffiliated adults have the same median age as Buddhists (36).","Buddhists made up roughly 7 % of the world ’s population in 2015 , but they are expected to decrease to roughly 5 % by 2060 .

Immigrants Living","Bipartisan groups of lawmakers in both the Senate and House have been working on bills to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, and those efforts will be at center stage as Congress returns to work this week. Key issues under discussion have been creating a path to citizenship, border security and shaping a guest worker program for low-skilled labor. A survey in March found that 71% of Americans say there should be a way for people in the United States illegally to remain in this country if they meet certain requirements, while 27% say they should not be allowed to stay legally. But there is a division of views among the 71% who support finding a way for immigrants here illegally to stay. Roughly four-in-ten (43%) of the public says unauthorized immigrants should be allowed to apply for citizenship, but 24% of the public says they should only be allowed to apply for legal residency. In 2011, there were about 40 million immigrants in the United States. Of that total, 11.1 million, or 28%, were in this country illegally. Support for providing legal status for unauthorized immigrants cuts across party lines, with backing from 64% of Republicans, 76% of Democrats and 70% of independents. Democrats are the biggest supporters of a pathway to citizenship with 48% favoring that option compared to 38% for Republicans and 39% for independents.

At that point, the shootings became the public’s top story. Before the Jan. 8 shootings, which drew high initial interest that was only expected to increase, the economy was the public’s top news story, although the incoming Republican leaders in Congress drew much more news coverage. Public perceptions of the tone of economic news have become much less negative over the past month. In fact, the percentage saying they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy has dropped to its lowest point since the question was first asked in December 2008. Currently, 24% say they are hearing mostly bad news, down 15 points from 39% in early December. The proportion saying they are hearing a mix of good and bad news has jumped from 55% last month to 68% in the new survey. However, as has been the case for the past two years, very few say they are hearing mostly good economic news; just 7% say this, which is little changed from 4% in December. The latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Jan. 6-9 among 1,018 adults, finds that Republicans, in particular, are much less likely to say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy than they were just a month ago. Currently, 24% say they have been hearing mostly bad news, half of the number that said this in early December (50%). Seven-in-ten (71%) Republicans say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, up from 47% in December. The changes among independents and Democrats have been smaller but are in the same direction: 17% of Democrats say they are hearing mostly bad news, down from 29% in December. Among independents, 28% say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy, down from 40% in December. Through most of the Obama administration, Republicans have been far more likely than Democrats to say the economic news they are hearing is mostly bad. In early November, for example, Republicans were twice as likely to say this (53% vs. 26%). Now, as the number of Republicans taking the most negative viewpoint has dropped, the partisan gap has narrowed to just seven points (24% of Republicans vs. 17% of Democrats). The weekly News Interest Index survey was being conducted when the Jan. 8 shootings in Tucson occurred. Before the rampage, Americans said they were tracking news about the economy most closely, but in the survey’s fourth and final day – the Sunday following the horrific events in Arizona – 34% said they were following news about the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords most closely, double the 17% that said they were following news about the economy most closely. Coming at the end of the week, the Tucson shootings were not a major factor in analysis of the full week’s coverage. (Next week’s News Interest Index and News Coverage Index will include public interest in and coverage of the Arizona shootings.) During the first three days interviewing (Jan. 6-8), the economy was the top story for the public, with 26% following economic news most closely compared with 13% who cited news about incoming Republican leaders. By contrast, news about the incoming Congress made up 18% of coverage for the week, much more than any other story, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). News about the economy accounted for 8%. The public showed moderate interest in the GOP taking control of the House of Representatives and most Americans say they heard at least a little about specific congressional actions and plans. In most cases, however, far fewer than half say they heard a lot about developments in the new Congress. The GOP’s efforts to repeal the health care law are registering widely with the public – 49% say they have heard a lot about these efforts. Fewer (39%) say they heard a lot about John Boehner becoming the new House speaker. Only about three-in-ten say they heard a lot about Republican proposals for billions of dollars in spending cuts (31%) and members of Congress reading the Constitution on the House floor (28%). Even fewer heard a lot about GOP plans to investigate government operations under the Obama administration (20%), the Democrats’ proposed changes in the Senate’s filibuster rules (14%) and members of the House reducing office and staff budgets by 5% (14%). Partisan differences in awareness of these stories are generally modest. However, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to hear a lot about Boehner becoming speaker (47% of Republicans vs. 36% of Democrats) and members of the House reading the Constitution (33% vs. 23%). Before the horrific shootings in Tucson captured the public’s attention over the weekend, Americans focused most closely on news about the economy – including positive reports about corporate profits and mixed news on the jobs front. About four-in-ten (39%) said they followed news about the economy very closely, matching the level of interest in the final weeks of December. A quarter (26%) said this was the news they followed most closely. The media devoted 8% of coverage to the economy. That does not include 2% of coverage that went to news about budget problems facing state and local governments. About a quarter of the public (24%) said they followed this news – featured prominently in the inaugural speeches of several new governors – very closely, while 8% said this was the news they followed most closely. About a quarter (26%) said they followed news about the incoming GOP leaders of Congress very closely, just about matching the 25% that said they followed news about incoming Democratic leaders that closely in January 2007. More than one-in-ten (13%) said this was the news they followed most closely. News about incoming officeholders nationwide filled 21% of the newshole, almost all about the new Congress (18%), according to PEJ. Nearly two-in-ten said they very closely followed news about changes in Barack Obama’s White House staff (19%) or news about the Navy commander relieved of his post because of his role in inappropriate videos broadcast on his ship (18%). Fewer than one-in-ten (8% each) said this was the story they followed most closely. The changes in the administration’s top staff accounted for 6% of coverage, while the actions taken against Capt. Owen Honors accounted for 4%. Just 7% said they very closely followed news about the assassination of a prominent Pakistani politician, which added to the political instability in that nation; 1% said this was the news they followed most closely. News about the assassination and its repercussions accounted for 3% of coverage. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected January 3-9, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected December 6-9, from a nationally representative sample of 1,018 adults. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Thursday through Sunday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a national sample of approximately 1,000 adults living in the continental United States, 18 years of age or older. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Results for the latest survey, conducted January 6-9, 2011, are based on a national sample of 1,018 adults (687 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 331 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 136 who had no landline telephone). Both the landline and cell phone samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample is also weighted to match current patterns of telephone status based on extrapolations from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","The weekly News Interest Index survey was being conducted when the Jan. 8 shootings in Tucson occurred .

Some of the vice president’s statements on Christian persecution comport with data from a recent Pew Research Center report on global religious restrictions in 2015. Christians have been harassed in more countries than any other religious group and have suffered harassment in many of the heavily Muslim countries of the Middle East and North Africa. But the report also shows that this widespread harassment is due in part to the huge size and broad geographic dispersion of Christians around the world, and that the Middle East is just one of a number of regions where Christians have faced harassment. (The Center’s recent report tracks harassment against religious groups around the world, but it does not attempt to estimate the number of victims in each country. As a result, it does not speak to the intensity of harassment in each country.) Christians were harassed by governments or social groups in a total of 128 countries in 2015 – more countries than any other religious group, according to the report. But there also were 2.3 billion Christians in 2015, more than any other religious group. Large populations of Christians are present in all but a few parts of the world: Roughly two-thirds of the world’s countries, for example, have Christian majorities. By contrast, smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries. For instance, because of their dense concentration in a small number of countries, 99% of Jews and Hindus lived in nations where members of their groups were harassed. And despite being one of the most geographically dispersed religious groups, 97% of Muslims lived in countries where harassment of Muslims occurred in 2015. (By comparison, 78% of Christians lived in places where Christians were harassed.) Due in part to the large number of Christian-majority countries, Christians were actually harassed mostly in Christian-majority countries. In some of these countries, the Christian majority was itself harassed, often by the government. For example, in Nicaragua – where an estimated 59% of the population is Catholic – the Catholic Church reported that the government monitored its emails and telephone conversations and granted financial support for churches based on the clergy’s political affiliation. The church also reported that the Nicaraguan government used Catholic traditions and symbols when promoting political agendas, saying it undermined the church’s religious authority. In other Christian-majority countries, Christian minority denominations were targeted. For example, in Eritrea – where Eritrean Orthodox Christianity is the dominant faith – Jehovah’s Witnesses reported being unable to obtain official identification documents because of their faith. In addition, the majority of religious prisoners in Eritrea in 2015 were Protestants, namely Pentecostals and evangelical Christians. While Christians were harassed in countries far beyond the Middle East and North Africa, they faced significant harassment in this region, too. In Syria, for example, Christians reported that tolerance within society was on the decline as extremist groups gained influence. And in Egypt, Christians were killed for having converted from Islam or simply because they were Christian. For example, in January and February 2015, two Christian men were killed – one of these murders was claimed by the Islamic State – in the North Sinai city of Arish, according to a Christian advocacy group with a presence in the region.","By contrast , smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries .

Here are some key findings about the state of the industry in 2018: 1U.S. newspaper circulation reached its lowest level since 1940, the first year with available data. Total daily newspaper circulation (print and digital combined) was an estimated 28.6 million for weekday and 30.8 million for Sunday in 2018. Those numbers were down 8% and 9%, respectively, from the previous year, according to the Center’s analysis of Alliance for Audited Media data. Both figures are now below their lowest recorded levels, though weekday circulation first passed this threshold in 2013. Digital circulation for daily newspapers is harder to track. It did rise in 2018, though not enough to fully reverse the overall decline in circulation. Revenue from circulation was steady in 2018, but ad revenue for newspapers fell 13%, according to an analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Though some national publications have seen growth in revenue and in digital subscriptions over the past few years, the newspaper sector overall continues to face challenges. 2Cable news was a bright spot in another down year for the U.S. news media industry’s economic fortunes. Revenue rose 4% over the past year for Fox News, CNN and MSNBC combined, according to estimates from Kagan, a media research group. That made cable news one of the only sectors with a revenue increase in 2018. Cable news revenue has grown by roughly a third (36%) since 2015, with ad revenue up 58% over the same period. And unlike some other sectors that typically see revenue declines in non-election years, cable news has been on a steady rise since the 2016 election. Some of this revenue has flowed back into newsroom spending, which has risen 22% since 2015. However, employment in cable TV newsrooms has not risen, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and neither have wages. 3Digital ad revenue has grown exponentially, but a majority goes to Facebook and Google rather than to publishers. Revenue from ads placed on digital platforms – counting all platforms, not just news sites – rose by 23% in 2018, and now makes up nearly half (49%) of all ad revenue in the U.S., according to eMarketer estimates. And when it comes to display ad revenue – a form of digital advertising that include banners, videos and other advertisements that news organizations and other websites typically run alongside their content – half of all digital revenue went to just two tech companies: Facebook (40%) and Google (12%). Overall digital ad revenue has tripled since 2011, the earliest year tracked, while digital display revenue has grown by almost five times over the same period. This growth in digital ad revenue has not been enough to make up for the decline in traditional ad revenue for some sectors. About a third of newspaper ad revenue (35%) now comes from digital, according to an analysis of SEC filings, but total ad revenue continues to fall. And while the digital-native news sector is on the rise – its newsroom workforce has nearly doubled over the past 10 years, according to BLS data – this growth hasn’t replaced the loss of employment at newspapers. 4The audience for local TV news has steadily declined. The average audience fell in key time slots in 2018, down 10% for morning news and 14% for late night and evening news, according to Comscore StationView Essentials® data. (This data is based on live viewing on TV sets and does not account for these stations’ websites or social media presences – though some research indicates that most local TV news consumers prefer the TV set to online forms.) This has been a longstanding trend, with declines in 2017 and, using a different data source, from 2007 to 2016. Over-the-air ad revenue for local TV did rise 12% in 2018, to $19.3 billion, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of MEDIA Access Pro & BIA Advisory Services data, but this is typical for a midterm election year and roughly equal to the amount in 2014. Local TV’s audience decline was the steepest drop of any sector. Only cable news saw its audience rise in 2018. 5Traffic to news websites seems to have leveled off. Unique visitors to the websites of both newspapers and digital-native news sites showed no growth between the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018, the second year in which there was no notable growth, according to Comscore, a cross-platform audience measurement company. From 2014 to 2016, traffic rose steadily for both these sectors in the fourth quarter. Time spent on these websites has declined as well: The average number of minutes per visit for digital-native news sites is down 16% since 2016, falling from nearly two and a half minutes to about two per visit. The decreases in website audience and time spent per visit come as Americans increasingly say they prefer social media as a pathway to news.

But when it comes to a measure to fund the government and end the shutdown, majorities in both parties have said it is unacceptable for their side to give ground.

More than half (54%) say it would be unacceptable for Republicans to drop this requirement even if it were the only way to end the shutdown. A similar share of Democrats want a deal with no changes to health care (75%) and say it would be unacceptable for Obama to give ground if it were necessary to end the shutdown (58%).  However, when compromise is presented as a general concept with no specific tradeoffs mentioned, the public’s attitude is different. A CBS News poll last week asked if Obama and Democrats should compromise in order to get a budget agreement and also asked if Republicans should compromise. The survey found that three-quarters of the public want the Democrats to compromise and three-quarters say the Republicans should compromise. That includes 61% of Democrats saying their own party should compromise and 59% of Republicans saying the GOP should compromise. And, in our recent survey, six-in-ten (61%) said lawmakers who share their views should be more willing to compromise instead of standing by their principles if it means the shutdown continues (29%). Pew Research surveys dating back 25 years, consistently show that the public, as a general proposition, likes political leaders who are willing to make compromises. In our April 2012 survey, fully 80% said they wanted leaders who were willing to compromise to get things done and just 16% disagreed. Democrats have always been more supportive of this idea than Republicans (90% of Democrats last year wanted leaders who compromised), but about two-thirds of Republicans consistently express this desire as well (68%). But this general desire for compromise becomes more limited when people are asked about specific issues, especially ones they care about. In 2007, we asked respondents about which party came closer to their views on a variety of issues. We then followed up by asking whether that party should compromise on the issue in order to reach an agreement or stick to its position even if it meant no progress would be made. When it came to specifics, the public was far less interested in their side compromising. For example, when people were asked if they wanted their preferred party to compromise on abortion policy or stick to its position, just one-quarter (25%) chose compromise and 72% preferred not compromising, even at the risk of getting nothing done. And on other political issues, where specific choices were mentioned, only about half said that their side should compromise to reach an agreement. Among those who said that a certain issue was their top priority, even fewer said their side should compromise on it. In the battle over funding the government, the health care law – which Republicans have put at the center of the debate– brings out passionate views on both sides. A Pew Research survey last month found that two-thirds of the public (67%) either strongly supports or strongly opposes the health care law. This intensity likely goes a long way in explaining why Americans want their leaders not to throw in the towel on the shutdown, though they still favor the idea of compromise in general.","Pew Research surveys dating back 25 years , consistently show that the public , as a general proposition , likes political leaders who are willing to make compromises .

Some nations are experiencing both growing incomes and expanding middle classes, while other nations are witness to stagnant or declining incomes and shrinking middle classes, a new Pew Research Center analysis of 11 Western European countries has found. But in a few other countries studied, the middle-class shares are decreasing even as incomes overall are rising. For the analysis – which covers the period from 1991 to 2010 and includes comparisons with changes in the United States – “middle-class” or “middle-income” adults in a country are those who live in households with disposable (after-tax) incomes ranging from two-thirds to double the country’s median disposable household income. Thus, the income it takes to be middle class varies across countries. Also, estimates in the new report will not match those in the Center’s previous reports, which were based on a household’s gross (pretax) income. Here are seven key findings in the new report: 1Among Western Europe’s six largest economies, the shares of adults living in middle-income households increased in France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, but they shrank in Germany, Italy and Spain. From 1991 to 2010, the middle-class share in the UK increased from 61% to 67%, but it decreased from 78% to 72% in Germany. Among the 11 Western European countries examined, the expansion in the UK was second only to the increase in Ireland, where the share increased from 60% in 1991 to 69% in 2010. The decrease in Germany was the second largest after Finland, where the middle-class share fell from 82% to 75% over the same period. Overall, the middle-class share of the adult population fell in seven of the 11 Western European countries examined, mirroring the long-term shrinking of the middle class in the U.S. 2In most countries studied, decreasing shares of middle-income populations led to rising shares of adults in lower- and upper-income tiers. These shifts signal a sharpening of economic divisions among households in many Western European countries and the U.S. However, there is also a general improvement in the economic status of adults because the movement up the income ladder was greater than the movement downward in most countries from 1991 to 2010. Among the Western European countries examined, the biggest gainers in economic status were the Dutch. In the Netherlands, there was a decrease in the share of adults in the lower-income tier and an increase in the share in the upper-income tier, which together yielded a large gain in overall economic status. At the other extreme, the increase in the lower-income share in Spain was much greater than the increase in the upper-income share, for a net loss in economic status from 1991 to 2010. 3Compared with Western Europe, the U.S. middle class is smaller. Among the countries examined, the U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six-in-ten adults were in the middle class in 2010. Meanwhile, compared with many Western European countries, greater shares of Americans were either lower income (26%) or upper income (15%). Thus, U.S. households were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries analyzed. In the Western European countries, middle-class shares in 2010 ranged from 64% in Spain to 80% in Denmark and Norway. The share of adults who were lower income was lowest in the Netherlands (13%) and highest in Spain (24%), and upper-income shares ranged from 6% in Norway to 14% in the UK. 4Incomes of middle-class households in the U.S. are greater than the incomes of most Western European middle classes. Financially, the American middle class is ahead of the middle classes in the Western European nations in terms of disposable (after-tax) household income, with the exception of Luxembourg. Middle-income households in Luxembourg lived on $71,799 annually in 2010, at the median, followed by $60,884 in the U.S. The middle class in Italy lived on a median income of $35,608, the most modest means among the countries analyzed. But lower-income Americans are at the middle of the pack in terms of earnings, lagging behind or barely matching lower-income adults in Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark. (Incomes are adjusted for household size, scaled to a household size of three, and expressed in 2011 prices and purchasing power parities; see the report’s Methodology section for more.) 5Compared with the U.S., middle-class households in many Western European countries experienced a greater increase in income. While middle-class incomes in the U.S. are greater than those of most Western European middle classes, the U.S. ranked near the middle when it came to how much that income had increased. In the U.S., the median income of middle-class households rose 9% from 1991 to 2010. Ireland, Norway and the UK led other countries in raising the incomes of households overall and of households within each income tier during that period. The median income of middle-class households in Ireland increased 71%, followed by 48% in Norway. Meanwhile, the incomes of middle-class households in Italy fell significantly (down 20%) and were virtually unchanged in Germany. This trend was also similar for the growth of the incomes of lower- and upper-income households. 6In most countries examined, the share of the country’s aggregate household income held by middle-income households fell from 1991 to 2010. The most substantial decrease in the share of aggregate household income held by the middle class occurred in Finland, where the share fell from 85% in 1991 to 74% in 2010. Other notable decreases in the share held by the middle class included Germany, where it fell from 77% to 70%, and the U.S., where the share slipped from 62% to 56%. Ireland and the UK are the only countries in which the shares of aggregate household income held by the middle class increased from 1991 to 2010. 7Income inequality is related to the size of the middle class in a country. The shares of adults who are in the lower-, middle- or upper-income tiers in a country are related to the country’s degree of income inequality – that is, the gap between the earnings of households near the top of the income distribution and those near the bottom. Countries where incomes are more equal have larger shares of middle-income adults, and vice versa. In 2010, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, which had the largest middle-income tiers, had lower to moderate levels of income inequality. The U.S. and Spain stood at the other end, with the smallest middle-income tiers and among the highest levels of income inequality.","For the analysis – which covers the period from 1991 to 2010 and includes comparisons with changes in the United States – “ middle - class ” or “ middle - income ” adults in a country are those who live in households with disposable ( after - tax ) incomes ranging from two - thirds to double the country ’s median disposable household income .

Just 23% of Americans now rate economic conditions in the country as excellent or good, down sharply from 57% at the start of the year. Most now say the economy is in either only fair (38%) or poor (38%) shape. In January, just 9% of Americans said economic conditions were poor. Related: About Half of Lower-Income Americans Report Household Job or Wage Loss Due to COVID-19 As the public confronts a grim new economic reality, there is not only overwhelming support for the massive economic aid package passed last month by President Donald Trump and Congress, but also widespread belief that an additional aid package will be needed. Nearly nine-in-ten U.S. adults (88%) say the $2 trillion economic aid package passed in March was the right thing to do, including identical majorities of Republicans and Democrats (89% each). More than three-quarters (77%) think it will be necessary for the president and Congress to pass legislation providing additional economic assistance. Majorities of Americans say the aid package enacted last month will do a great deal or a fair amount to help a range of actors, including large businesses (77%), small businesses (71%), state and local governments (67%) and unemployed people (68%). However, only about half (49%) expect it to benefit self-employed people, while 46% think it will help their own household a great deal or fair amount. In part, this reflects the fact that lower-income adults are far more likely than more affluent people to say the aid package will benefit them. A 59% majority of those in lower-income households believe the federal aid will help them, compared with just 22% in upper-income households. (To analyze these questions further, visit the Election News Pathways data tool.) The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted April 7 to 12 among 4,917 U.S. adults on the Center’s American Trends Panel, finds that most Americans believe the economic problems arising from the coronavirus outbreak will persist for months to come. A majority (71%) says the economic problems resulting from the outbreak will last for at least six months, including 39% who say they will last a year or more. Just 29% expect these problems to last six months or less. Yet the public does expect some improvement over time from today’s dire economic conditions. A majority (55%) expects that economic conditions in the country as a whole will be better a year from now than they are today, while 22% say they will be worse and 22% expect conditions to be about the same as they are now. The survey finds that the public’s reactions to the recently passed economic aid package differ markedly from views of the economic stimulus plan enacted during the early months of Barack Obama’s presidency. At that time, views of the economy were even more negative than they are today, with 68% saying economic conditions were poor (38% say that today). In March 2009, 56% said the $800 billion stimulus plan put forth by Barack Obama and passed by Congress was a good idea; about a third (35%) said it was a bad idea. While the question about the economic package passed in March differs somewhat, 88% of the public says it was the right thing to do. In contrast to the extensive bipartisan support for coronavirus aid, support for the 2009 stimulus aid package was divided along partisan lines: 79% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said it was a good idea, but just 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners said the same. The dramatic plunge in positive assessments of the national economy as a result of the coronavirus outbreak is steeper than declines in economic ratings seen during the last two recessions. Before they took a sudden negative turn, economic attitudes were historically positive. Just three months ago, the public’s views of the national economy were more positive than they had been at any point over the past 20 years. This is very different from the Great Recession, which began in December 2007. Even before the recession and subsequent financial crisis, the public’s views of the national economy were not all that positive. They declined more gradually in 2007-2008 and remained very negative for the next several years. After the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, views of the economy slipped precipitously, but far less rapidly than they have during the coronavirus outbreak. While public views of the economy prior to the economic trouble of the early 2000s were even brighter than they were prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, it took considerably longer for perceptions to fall as far as they already have in the first three months of 2020. While the public takes a far more negative view of the economy, opinions about economic conditions are far less divided by income and partisanship than they were prior to the crisis. In January, those living in upper-income households were 30 percentage points more likely than those living in lower-income households to say economic conditions in the country were excellent or good (73% vs. 43%). Today, there are no significant differences across income tiers in positive ratings of the national economy; only about a quarter in each income category rates conditions as excellent or good. The gap in positive economic ratings between Republicans and Democrats has decreased from 42 percentage points at the start of the year to 26 points today. Republicans remain somewhat more likely than Democrats to say the economy is in excellent or good shape (37% vs. 11%). Consistent with the patterns across income tiers overall, differences in economic ratings by income among both Republicans and Democrats are now much smaller than they were in January. There is general agreement between Republicans and Democrats that the federal aid package will help large and small businesses, state and local governments and unemployed people. Still, the shares who think the aid package will help most groups tend to be larger among Republicans than Democrats. Overall, 83% of Republicans and Republican leaners think the federal government’s aid package will help small businesses either a great deal (32%) or a fair amount (51%). A smaller majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (60%) think small businesses will get at least a fair amount of help from the aid. Larger majorities of Republicans than Democrats also think state and local governments (77% vs. 59%) and unemployed people (80% vs. 57%) will get at least a fair amount of help from the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak. By contrast, Democrats (81%) are somewhat more likely than Republicans (74%) to think large businesses will receive at least a fair amount of help from the federal government; the share of Democrats who think large corporations will get a great deal of help from the aid package is nearly double the share of Republicans who say this (45% vs. 23%). About six-in-ten Republicans (61%) think self-employed people will benefit at least a fair amount from the federal aid. Democrats are less sure: 38% say it will help self-employed people a great deal or a fair amount, while 61% say it will help them not too much or not at all. Both Republicans and Democrats see their own household as less likely to be helped by the federal aid than large and small businesses, state and local governments and unemployed people. Still, partisan differences extend to personal assessments. Among Republicans, 51% think the aid will help their household at least a fair amount, while about as many (49%) say it will help them not too much or not at all. Democrats are less hopeful: 40% say it will help their household a great deal or fair amount, compared with 59% who think it won’t help much or at all. There also are significant differences by household income in the shares who expect to be helped by the COVID-19 federal aid package. A majority of Americans in lower-income households (59%) think the federal response will help them either a great deal (25%) or a fair amount (34%). About half (48%) of middle-income earners think the aid package will help them at least a fair amount. Upper-income earners are far less likely to say this: Just 22% expect the federal response to help their own household. Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to expect their household to be helped by the aid package across all income tiers. Although Americans have become much more negative about the current state of the economy, 55% expect that things will be better a year from now. Just 22% think they will be worse; another 22% think economic conditions will be about the same as they are today. Younger people are much less optimistic that economic conditions will improve compared with older Americans. Nearly seven-in-ten of those ages 65 and older (69%) think the economy will be better in a year. By contrast, fewer than half (42%) of those ages 18 to 29 think things will be better, while 34% expect conditions to be worse in a year. While younger people were slightly less optimistic about the future economy even prior to the current downturn, the age gap is now substantially wider than it was in January. Adults with a college degree and those with higher incomes are more likely to expect the economy to be better in a year than those with lower levels of education and income. In January, those with a college degree were less likely than those without a bachelor’s degree to say economic conditions would improve. In addition, white adults (62%) are more likely than black (38%) and Hispanic (40%) adults to say conditions will be better in a year. Some of largest differences in economic outlook are between Republicans and Democrats, though this partisan gap is somewhat narrower than it was in January. Today, 72% of Republicans and Republican leaners think conditions will be better in a year; relatively few think they will be worse (12%) or the same (15%). Democrats and Democratic leaners are more divided in their views: 41% expect the economy to be better, while 30% think it will be worse and 28% think it will be about the same. While a narrow majority expects overall economic conditions to be better in a year, the public also thinks the negative economic impacts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak will persist for some time. About seven-in-ten (71%) say the economic problems resulting from the outbreak will last more than six months, including 39% who say that they will last a year or more. Just 9% think the economic problems resulting from the coronavirus outbreak will pass in three months, while 19% expect the problems to last four to six months. College graduates are more likely than those without a degree to anticipate longer-term negative economic effects of the outbreak – with 79% of college grads vs. 67% of those without a degree expecting problems to last six months or longer. About three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic leaners (78%) think economic problems will last more than six months, including 48% who think they will last a year or more. A narrower majority of Republicans (62%) think the problems will last more than six months, and just 28% expect them to last a year or more. Within both parties, those with higher levels of education are more likely than those with lower levels of education to expect the negative impacts of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy to last at least a year. These differences are particularly pronounced among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Among Democrats, those with at least a college degree are 15 percentage points more likely than those with no degree to say that the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak will last at least a year (58% compared with 43%). A third of college-educated Republicans think the economic problems resulting from the outbreak will last a year or more, compared with 26% of Republicans with no college degree. At this stage of the outbreak, 77% of the public thinks it will be necessary for the president and Congress to pass another bill to provide more economic assistance for the country. While clear majorities in both parties say additional economic assistance will be necessary, there is less bipartisan unanimity in views about a follow-up bill than about the previous aid package. While nearly nine-in-ten Democrats say another bill will be necessary, a narrower majority of Republicans (66%) say the same. Within the GOP, moderates and liberals (74%) are more likely than conservatives (61%) to say an additional aid package will be necessary. And liberal Democrats are slightly more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to think another bill will be necessary (92% vs. 83%). Even as national economic ratings have plummeted, personal financial assessments have been far more stable. In the current survey, 47% describe their own personal financial situation as excellent or good, compared with slightly more (52%) saying it is only fair or poor. Last summer, about as many described their finances as excellent or good (50%) as said they were only fair or poor (49%). Upper-income and middle-income households have seen a sharper decline in their personal financial ratings than lower-income households. Since last summer, the share rating their own finances as excellent or good is down 13 percentage points among middle-income households and down 11 points among upper-income households; these ratings are down just 3 points among lower-income households. Still, very large differences remain in personal ratings across income tiers: Higher earners are almost three times as likely as lower earners to say their finances are in excellent or good shape (75% vs. 27%). Previous telephone polling has found that personal economic ratings tend to change less dramatically than national ratings. For instance, during the Great Recession, assessments of the national economy showed more dramatic movement and became more intensely negative than personal ratings. While the decline in overall personal financial ratings has been modest, a new analysis of the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on family finances finds that 43% say someone in their household has taken a pay cut or lost a job as a result of the outbreak. In part, the difference in these two measures is tied to the fact that those who already rated their own personal financial situation as only fair or poor in August of 2019 are significantly more likely to say their household has experienced wage cuts or job loss as a result of the coronavirus outbreak than those who rated their finances more positively last summer. The public’s expectations for the direction of their future financial situation is also little changed: 42% now expect their personal financial situation to be better a year from now than it is today, while 46% say it will be about the same and 12% expect it to be worse.","Among Republicans , 51 % think the aid will help their household at least a fair amount , while about as many ( 49 % ) say it will help them not too much or not at all .

After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants—most of whom came illegally—the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed, according to a new analysis of government data from both countries by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. The standstill appears to be the result of many factors, including the weakened U.S. job and housing construction markets, heightened border enforcement, a rise in deportations, the growing dangers associated with illegal border crossings, the long-term decline in Mexico’s birth rates and broader economic conditions in Mexico. It is possible that the Mexican immigration wave will resume as the U.S. economy recovers. Even if it doesn’t, it has already secured a place in the record books. The U.S. today has more immigrants from Mexico alone—12.0 million—than any other country in the world has from all countries of the world.1 Some 30% of all current U.S. immigrants were born in Mexico. The next largest sending country—China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan)—accounts for just 5% of the nation’s current stock of about 40 million immigrants. Looking back over the entire span of U.S. history, no country has ever seen as many of its people immigrate to this country as Mexico has in the past four decades. However, when measured not in absolute numbers but as a share of the immigrant population at the time, immigration waves from Germany and Ireland in the late 19th century equaled or exceeded the modern wave from Mexico. Beyond its size, the most distinctive feature of the modern Mexican wave has been the unprecedented share of immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally. Just over half (51%) of all current Mexican immigrants are unauthorized, and some 58% of the estimated 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. are Mexican (Passel and Cohn, 2011). The sharp downward trend in net migration from Mexico began about five years ago and has led to the first significant decrease in at least two decades in the unauthorized Mexican population. As of 2011, some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S., down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007, according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the same period, the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly, from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011. The net standstill in Mexican-U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years. During the five-year period from 2005 to 2010, a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States, down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five-year period of 1995 to 2000. Meantime, the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million, roughly double the number who had done so in the five-year period a decade before. While it is not possible to say so with certainty, the trend lines within this latest five-year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two. Of the 1.4 million people who migrated from the U.S. to Mexico since 2005, including about 300,000 U.S.-born children, most did so voluntarily, but a significant minority were deported and remained in Mexico. Firm data on this phenomenon are sketchy, but Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on government data from both countries suggest that 5% to 35% of these returnees may not have moved voluntarily. In contrast to the decrease of the Mexican born, the U.S. immigrant population from all countries has continued to grow and numbered 39.6 million in 2011, according to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. In addition, the number of Mexican-Americans in the U.S.—both immigrants and U.S.-born residents of Mexican ancestry—is continuing to rise. The Mexican-American population numbered 33 million in 2010.2 As reported previously (Pew Hispanic Center, 2011), between 2000 and 2010 births surpassed immigration as the main reason for growth of the Mexican-American population. The population of Mexican-born residents of the U.S. is larger than the population of most countries or states. Among Mexican-born people worldwide, one-in-ten lives in the United States. This report has five additional sections. The next section analyzes statistics on migration between Mexico and the United States from data sources in both countries. The third uses mainly Mexican data to examine characteristics, experience and future intentions of Mexican migrants handed over to Mexican authorities by U.S. law enforcement agencies. The fourth, based on U.S. data, examines trends in border enforcement statistics. The fifth looks at changing conditions in Mexico that might affect migration trends. The report’s last section looks at characteristics of Mexican-born immigrants in the U.S., using U.S. Census Bureau data. The appendix explains the report’s methodology and data sources. Among the report’s other main findings from these sections:","The sharp downward trend in net migration from Mexico began about five years ago and has led to the first significant decrease in at least two decades in the unauthorized Mexican population . As of 2011 , some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. , down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007 , according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Over the same period , the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly , from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011 . The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five - year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five - year period of 1995 to 2000 . Meantime , the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million , roughly double the number who had done so in the five - year period a decade before . While it is not possible to say so with certainty , the trend lines within this latest five - year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two .","What is the difference in the immigration rate of Mexicans to the United States between the periods 1995 to 2000 and 2005 to 2010?","The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five - year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five - year period of 1995 to 2000 .","The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years .

Publics in Germany and the United States support TTIP and trade expansion in general, especially with each other. But when it comes to specifics, both Americans and Germans oppose many details of this far-reaching initiative. Moreover, they disagree with one another on making transatlantic regulatory standards similar. And, in the United States, there is a striking generation gap in attitudes relating to TTIP. Motivations for backing the deal also differ. Americans, more than Germans, are somewhat more likely to support this trade agreement as part of a broader effort to boost competitiveness with China. These are among the main findings of two parallel Pew Research Center surveys conducted among 953 people in Germany from February 25 to February 26, 2014 and 1,002 people in the United States from February 27 to March 2, 2014. All interviews were done by telephone. The survey was conducted in partnership with the Bertelsmann Foundation, the North American arm of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German foundation that promotes international understanding. By more than two-to-one, Germans (55% to 25%) and Americans (53% to 20%) say TTIP will be good for their countries. There is no partisan divide in support for TTIP between adherents of the major German political parties, but more Democrats (60%) than Republicans (44%) in the United States back the deal. And while there is no generation gap on this issue in Germany, young Americans (67%), those ages 18 to 29, are significantly more in favor of TTIP than their elders (45%), age 50 and older. Support for TTIP in principle does not translate into majority backing for some of the key objectives of the negotiation. The TTIP talks are multifaceted. They aim to reduce or eliminate tariffs on all merchandise trade across the Atlantic. Another goal is to remove restrictions on transatlantic investment. And, for the first time in any bilateral trade agreement, TTIP involves an attempt to come up with common technological and regulatory standards for the transatlantic marketplace, wherever possible. Only 38% of Germans and 41% of Americans support the removal of all tariffs on the transatlantic shipment of goods. Just 41% of Germans and 39% of Americans back the elimination of restrictions on transatlantic foreign investment. And Germans and Americans sharply disagree over the most ambitious TTIP objective: making transatlantic regulatory standards as similar as possible. While Americans support such an effort by a margin of four-to-one (76% to 18%), just 45% of Germans agree. A consistent generation gap also exists in the United States around the details of a U.S.-EU free trade agreement. Young people are more predisposed than older Americans to support removing investment barriers and eliminating tariffs. Roughly eight-in-ten Americans under age 30 also back the idea of making product and service standards as similar as possible between the U.S. and EU, perhaps not surprising given the fact that this generation is far less trusting than their parents and grandparents of the U.S. government’s ability to set strong safety and privacy standards. Revelations of spying by the U.S. National Security Agency, including listening in on phone calls made by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also may have impacted German and American views on regulation of data privacy. A significant share (85%) of Germans prefers European regulation of data privacy, trusting more in their own government’s capacity in this realm than in U.S. regulation. And, in the United States, men, the young, those with a college degree and high-income persons disproportionately lack faith in American standards protecting their data’s confidentiality. Overall, roughly half (49%) of Americans trust U.S. privacy standards. But only about four-in-ten high-income Americans (39%) share that trust compared with nearly six-in-ten low-income people (58%), a 19 percentage point difference in views. There is a similar 14 point divide on the issue between those who have graduated from college (39%) and those without a college degree (53%). Overall, TTIP’s broad goal is to boost transatlantic trade and investment. More than seven-in-ten Americans and Germans see increasing U.S.-EU trade as beneficial, with nearly eight-in-ten Americans supportive of more trade with Germany in particular. However, Americans are, in general, more approving than Germans when it comes to transatlantic investment. Two-thirds of Americans (66%), but only roughly half of Germans (49%), say that greenfield investment, when foreigners build new factories in their country, helps the nation. But nearly three-quarters of Germans (73%) and more than half of Americans (56%) say foreign mergers and acquisitions (where a European corporation buys an existing American one or a U.S. company acquires a German firm) hurt the country. Americans and Germans believe that growing trade between their country and other nations is a good thing. Nearly nine-in-ten Germans (88%) and roughly seven-in-ten Americans (71%) hold such positive views about international commerce. Only 9% of Germans but 23% of Americans voice the view that trade is bad for their country. Such findings comport with past Pew Research surveys that show publics in both countries back trade in principle. But Germans are somewhat stronger supporters of international commerce. Roughly a third (34%) say trade is a very good thing, compared with around a quarter (26%) of Americans who hold such intense views. German and American men are more likely to say trade is a very good thing than are their female compatriots. High-income individuals and those with a college degree in both nations are more likely than those with a low income and without a college degree to take the view that trade is very good for their country. Americans and Germans generally share the view that increasing trade with a range of other countries would be beneficial. But they differ somewhat on the value of such commerce when it comes to specific prospective trading partners. The United States and the European Union are each other’s largest merchandise trading partners. In 2013, bilateral commerce totaled $649 billion, according to U.S. government data. In that trade, America is Germany’s fourth biggest export market and source of imports. And Germany is the fifth largest trading partner of the United States. Given such extensive transatlantic commerce, it is hardly surprising that, in principle, Americans and Germans overwhelmingly support more bilateral trade and endorse the broad objective of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Three-quarters (75%) of Germans say increased trade with the United States would be good for Germany. But just 18% say it would be very good. And 79% of Americans say increased commerce with Germany would be good for the United States. And, among these respondents, 29% say more German-American trade would be very good. In addition, roughly seven-in-ten (72%) Americans agree that more exports and imports with the European Union would be beneficial to the United States. Roughly twice as many men (29%) as women (15%), Americans with a college degree (36%) versus those without such a degree (16%), and high-income people (31%) versus low-income individuals (15%) say more U.S.-EU trade would be very good. Both Germans and Americans see benefit for their countries in boosting trade with many other nations. Japan is currently Germany’s 15th largest trading partner and the EU’s seventh biggest trading relationship. Japan is the fourth largest U.S. trading partner and Washington is currently engaged in negotiations with Tokyo to include Japan in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a regional free trade agreement. In Germany and the United States publics are overwhelmingly supportive of increasing trade with Japan. Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) Germans say increased commerce with Japan would be good for Germany, while roughly three-quarters (74%) of Americans say more U.S. trade with Japan would be beneficial for their country. Germans and Americans also see eye-to-eye on increasing commerce with Brazil. That Latin American emerging market is currently the EU’s ninth largest trading partner but only Germany’s 22nd. Brazil is the ninth biggest U.S. trading relationship. Roughly two-thirds of Germans (67%) and Americans (64%) approve of boosting trading with Brazil, although – more so than with other nations – people are also likely to have no opinion on the matter. However, when it comes to trade with China and Russia, German and American views diverge. China is America’s second biggest trading partner, the EU’s second largest trading relationship and Germany’s number three international commercial partner. A strong majority of Germans (63%) but only about half of Americans (51%) say more trade with China would be beneficial to their country. Moreover, nearly three times as many Americans (20%) as Germans (7%) voice the view that more commerce with the People’s Republic would be very bad. Publics in Germany and the United States are also divided over more trade with China along generational and gender lines. More than seven-in-ten German men (73%) and more than half (56%) of American men, but just 52% of German women and 46% of U.S. women, favor more commerce with China. Similarly, 72% of Germans ages 18 to 29 and 59% of young Americans back more trade with China, while 61% of Germans 50 years of age and older and only 45% of older Americans agree. Such differences in sentiment may reflect the fact that, in 2013, the U.S. trade deficit with China was 36 times greater than Germany’s imbalance with China. The United States ran a $318.4 billion trade deficit with China, while Germany had just an $8.8 billion (€6.4 billion) shortfall. More than six-in-ten (64%) Germans say increasing trade with Russia, its fourth largest trading partner outside the EU, would be a good thing. (The Pew Research Center survey was in the field during Russian military movement into the Crimea.) Just 47% of Americans would like to boost commerce with Russia. Reflecting German and American support for increased bilateral commerce, more than half the publics in the United States (53%) and in Germany (55%) say that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership would be good for their country. Support for TTIP is shared by men and women, those with a college degree and those without a college degree. It is also shared across income groups in the United States. But high-income Germans (66%) are more likely to support TTIP than low-income ones (49%). Notably, however, more than one-in-four Americans (28%) and nearly one-in-five Germans (19%) volunteered they had either not heard enough about the negotiation, saw it as neither good nor bad, or did not know how they felt. Americans and Germans express a range of rationales for supporting TTIP, with no single motivation predominating. About a third of respondents in both countries who think a U.S.-EU trade agreement is a good thing say it will help their economies. More Germans than Americans say it will strengthen ties between the United States and the European Union. Notably, Americans are much more likely than Germans to say that they think TTIP is good for their country because it will help their nation to be more competitive with China. (For more on American and German attitudes toward China see this Pew Research Center report.) About half (52%) of Americans age 50 and older who support the agreement see China as a motivation for TTIP. The TTIP negotiation is multifaceted. It aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs on all merchandise trade across the Atlantic. Another goal is to remove restrictions on transatlantic investment. And, for the first time in any bilateral trade agreement, TTIP involves an attempt to come up with common technological and regulatory standards for the transatlantic marketplace, wherever possible. Roughly half the U.S. public (49%) opposes removing all duties that increase the price of goods imported from the European Union. And a majority of the German public (57%) opposes removing tariffs on products imported from the United States. However, German resistance to duty elimination is muted. Most of those in opposition (47%) say they are somewhat, not strongly, opposed. About half of Germans (53%) and Americans (49%) also oppose lifting investment restrictions between the United States and the European Union. Again, German opposition is mild. In addition, Germans and Americans are of two minds about the beneficial nature of foreign investment, with brick-and-mortar investments acceptable to publics in both countries, while takeovers by foreigners are largely unacceptable. Two-thirds (66%) of Americans say that European companies building factories in the United States will mostly help the U.S. economy. Men (71%) more than women (62%) support such greenfield investment. And, there is strong support for it among Americans with at least a college degree (84%). A smaller proportion of Germans, roughly half (49%), express the view that American firms building plants in Germany will benefit the local economy. Men (55%) are more supportive than women (43%), as are Germans age 18 to 29 (55%) compared with people 50 years of age and older (44%). German ambivalence about such new U.S. investment may stem from a distrust of American business practices. A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that nearly two-thirds of Germans (65%) disliked American ways of doing business. Foreign-led mergers and acquisitions of German companies are decidedly unpopular. Just 19% of Germans say such foreign investment helps Germany, 73% say it hurts. Meanwhile, Americans are not that much more enthusiastic about foreigners buying U.S. firms. Just 31% back European takeovers, 56% oppose them. Moreover, women (61%) are more opposed than men (51%), and those without a college degree (59%) are more likely than those with a college degree (49%) to say such investment hurts . Some of the biggest differences between Americans and Germans involve the most ambitious TTIP negotiating objective: common regulatory standards. Roughly three-quarters of Americans (76%) support making American and European standards for products and services as similar as possible. This includes 35% who strongly back such efforts. Only 18% oppose similar standards. But just 45% of Germans support commonality, including just 13% who strongly back such an effort. And 51% of Germans oppose it. German reluctance to support similar transatlantic regulatory standards is driven by an overwhelming German preference for European regulations. On a range of consumer issues, Germans simply trust European regulatory norms more than American ones. For their part, Americans put more trust in U.S. standards, but their support is not nearly so lopsided. Washington and Brussels have long been at odds over the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMO) used in America – such as those in soybeans – and over the safety of U.S.-raised poultry and meat. The depth of that divide is evident in contrasting German and American sentiment. More than nine-in-ten Germans (94%) trust European food-safety standards while just 2% trust American regulations. Two-thirds of Americans (67%) trust U.S. standards. The United States is the world’s second-largest producer of motor vehicles. Germany is the fourth-largest manufacturer. Their publics each prefer their own auto safety regulations. But German confidence is greater. About nine-in-ten Germans (91%) trust German auto-safety standards more than U.S. ones. More than half of Americans (55%) trust U.S. standards more, although a third have greater trust in European . Revelations of U.S. National Security Agency spying on phone and email traffic have been sharply criticized by German pundits and politicians. This contretemps comes after years of transatlantic disagreement over commercial data collection and the movement of that information across borders, often by Wall Street financial service firms and Silicon Valley information technology companies. In the wake of such disputes, 85% of Germans trust European rather than U.S. data privacy standards. Barely half of Americans (49%) trust their own country’s confidentiality standards, although 23% of Americans trust neither European nor U.S. standards, or have no opinion. Finally, on environmental safety, 96% of Germans prefer European standards, while 60% of Americans back U.S. norms. Notably, age, income and education influence American trust in U.S. standards. Overall, young Americans, those age 18 to 29, are less likely to have faith in U.S. regulation than are people 50 years of age and older. And, in the case of environmental safety and data privacy standards, young Americans are actually divided over whether they prefer U.S. or European standards. High-income individuals generally trust U.S. standards, but to a lesser degree than low-income Americans. In the case of data privacy and auto safety, they are divided on whether they trust European or U.S. regulation. People with a college degree are less likely to trust U.S. standards than those with no college degree. TTIP is being negotiated at the same time as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade deal between Washington and eleven countries in Asia and Latin America. A similar proportion of Americans (55%) are supportive of the transpacific agreement as support TTIP (53%). One-in-five Americans (20%) oppose TTIP and one-in-four (25%) oppose TPP. While 19% of respondents say they had not heard of or had no opinion about the transpacific agreement, 28% expressed no view on the proposed European accord. Moreover, there is a partisan divide on both TTIP and the transpacific agreement. Fully 60% of Democrats say TTIP is good for the United States, but only 44% of Republicans agree. At the same time, 59% of Democrats back the transpacific accord, but only 49% of the GOP supports it. This partisan divide, in which Democrats are more supportive of trade than Republicans, runs counter to conventional wisdom in the United States and abroad that Democrats are protectionists and Republicans are free traders. However, such assumptions about partisan views on trade are not borne out by Pew Research surveys that have shown for some time that Democrats are more supportive than Republicans of growing trade and business ties between the United States and other countries. Young Americans (65%) are more likely than older ones (49%) to say TPP will help the United States. (Such findings comport with earlier Pew Research results showing that young Americans think Asia is more important to the United States than Europe. Older Americans think its Europe.) Notably, public support for both TTIP and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreements generally exceeds public backing for the North American Free Trade Agreement during the time it was being negotiated, according to numerous polls in 1992 and 1993. Finally, TTIP is being negotiated at a time of rising anti-EU sentiment across Europe, including in Germany. A growing number of people are questioning some of the founding principles of the European Union (see the 2013 Pew Research Center report on the topic), including the right of the European Commission to negotiate all trade agreements for EU member states. Asked whether the European Union should negotiate international trade agreements on behalf of Germany or should the German government negotiate trade accords for Germany, by more than two-to-one (65% to 28%) Germans say Berlin not Brussels should be the negotiator. Support for this reassertion of the nation state’s role in international commercial agreements is particularly strong (73%) among members of the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Parties. Backing for returning this authority to Berlin is strong, but somewhat less so (60%), among members of the Social Democratic Party.","Finally , TTIP is being negotiated at a time of rising anti - EU sentiment across Europe , including in Germany .

Despite the turmoil associated with events such as the European debt crisis, a massive influx of refugees, and Brexit, Europeans continue to believe the EU stands for noble goals. Across 10 European nations recently surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 74% say the EU promotes peace, and most also think it promotes democratic values and prosperity. However, Europeans also tend to describe Brussels as inefficient and intrusive, and in particular they believe the EU is out of touch – a median of 62% say it does not understand the needs of its citizens. Many are also worried about the economic future. Across these 10 nations, a median of 58% believe that when children in their country grow up, they will be worse off financially than their parents; only 30% think they will be better off. There are also strong concerns about immigration in some countries. Majorities or pluralities in most nations want fewer immigrants allowed into their country. Many believe that immigrants tend to remain distinct from the broader culture and that immigration increases the risk of terrorism. The survey also finds that views about the EU and the challenges facing Europe vary in important ways across the nations included in the study. Overall, attitudes toward the EU are largely positive. Majorities in most nations polled express a favorable opinion of the Brussels-based institution, with roughly seven-in-ten in Poland and Spain holding that view. Less than half see the EU favorably, however, in Greece and the United Kingdom (which at the time of this writing is debating its exit from the EU, originally scheduled for March 29, 2019). And as May elections for the European Parliament approach, attitudes toward the EU-wide legislative body are mixed, although overall ratings are slightly more favorable (a median of 50%) than unfavorable (45%). The UK and Greece once again stand out for their negative assessments, while Germans and the French are almost evenly divided. CORRECTION (March 19, 2019): The above chart has been corrected to reflect an error in the reporting on negative views of the EU among those who hold favorable and unfavorable opinions of Syriza in Greece, Jobbik in Hungary and Insoumise in France. The chart title has also been modified. Within nations, views about the EU diverge along ideological and demographic lines, with young people and those on the political left offering more positive opinions. Meanwhile, negative views are especially common among supporters of right-wing populist parties. (For more on how populist parties are classified, see Appendix.) For example, 62% of Germans with a positive opinion of Alternative for Germany (AfD) express an unfavorable opinion of the EU, compared with just 29% of those who rate AfD negatively. In Spain, supporters of the left-wing populist party Podemos are also particularly likely to give the EU a negative rating. However, those with positive views of left-wing populist parties in France (La France Insoumise) and Greece (Syriza) are more likely to have a favorable opinion of the EU. Europeans have experienced a variety of economic challenges in recent years, and the financial anxiety felt by many is clearly reflected in the survey’s findings. A remarkable number of Europeans believe the financial situation for average people in their country has not improved over the past two decades. In Greece, Italy and Spain – three southern European nations hit hard by the financial crisis – large majorities say average people are worse off than they were 20 years ago. And roughly half or more share this view in France and the UK. Two notable exceptions are Poland and Sweden, where about two-in-three believe people are generally better off financially. Views about the recent economic past differ along partisan lines in some nations. Germans who express a favorable opinion of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) see the past 20 years much more positively than those who rate the party negatively. Just 33% of CDU supporters say things have gotten worse, compared with 61% of those who don’t support the CDU. Similarly, only 45% of the French with a favorable opinion of President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche believe things have gotten worse, compared with 66% of people with an unfavorable view of En Marche. There is also widespread pessimism about the economic future. Majorities in most of the nations polled say that when children in their country grow up, they will be worse off financially than their parents, including eight-in-ten people in France who hold this view. Poland again stands out as having more positive views: 59% of Poles are optimistic about the next generation’s economic prospects. While economic challenges have been a regular feature of debates about Europe’s future in recent years, immigration has also been a consistent and controversial topic. There is a strong desire in many countries for less immigration – roughly seven-in-ten or more want fewer immigrants in Greece, Hungary and Italy. This view is less common in France, the Netherlands, the UK and Spain, where roughly four-in-ten or fewer say they want less immigration. Public concerns about immigration often center around culture and a perceived link to terrorism. Across the 10 nations surveyed, a median of 51% believe immigrants want to remain distinct from the broader society, while 38% think they want to adopt the nation’s customs and way of life. A median of 57% say immigration increases the risk of terrorism in their country, while 38% believe it does not. Many do see upsides to immigration, however, including the view that immigrants make their country stronger through their hard work and talents. Most also support encouraging highly skilled people to come to their country for work, and a median of 77% favor taking in refugees from nations where people are fleeing violence and war. In several nations, people are worried about emigration. Eight-in-ten or more in Greece, Spain, Italy and Hungary say people leaving their country for jobs in other countries is a very big or moderately big problem, and 68% of Poles also express this opinion. In addition to economic tumult and challenges regarding immigration, the past decade has also seen shifts in the stature of European nations on the world stage. This is particularly true of Germany. Across the 10 European nations polled, a median of 47% say Germany plays a more important role than a decade ago, while 36% believe it plays as important a role and just 15% think it is less important. Only 25% think France plays a more important role, while a roughly equal share say it is actually less important. As it struggles with the ramifications of its Brexit vote, the UK fares the worst among the three nations tested: 38% believe the UK is less important than it was 10 years ago, while only 21% think it is more important. (For more on what people around the world think about the trajectory of major powers, see “Trump’s International Ratings Remain Low, Especially Among Key Allies.”) These are among the major findings from a recent Pew Research Center survey conducted among 10,112 respondents in 10 countries from May 24 to July 12, 2018. Europeans’ views of the EU remain generally positive after a sharp increase in 2017. Across the 10 European states surveyed, a median of 62% hold a favorable view of the institution. Ratings of the EU are highest in Poland and Spain, where roughly seven-in-ten have favorable views. About six-in-ten see the EU positively in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, Italy and Hungary. The UK and Greece, however, do not hold such favorable attitudes. In the UK, opinion is roughly split; 48% have a favorable opinion of the EU while 45% have an unfavorable one. And in Greece, only 37% have a positive opinion of the institution. Opinions of the EU – both positive and negative – have remained unchanged since 2017 in all but three countries. In France, support for the EU increased from 56% in 2017 to 62% in 2018. Opinion has soured, however, in Hungary (down 10 percentage points) and the UK (down 6 points). Young adults – those ages 18 to 29 – are often more likely than people ages 50 and older to have a positive opinion of the EU. This age gap is particularly large in the Netherlands, where 83% of young adults but only 52% of older adults view the EU favorably. A similarly large gap can be found in the UK, where the 2016 referendum on EU membership was broadly split along age lines. Political ideology is also frequently linked to opinion of the EU. In six of the 10 nations surveyed, people on the left of the ideological spectrum are more likely than those on the right to have a favorable attitude toward the institution. Spain, however, shows the opposite, with those on the left holding more negative views. A similar pattern can be seen when examining sentiment among people who favor populist parties. Most of the major populist parties across Europe are on the right side of the ideological spectrum and are often strong critics of European integration. People who favor these parties in many countries are significantly less likely to have a positive view of the EU. For example, among Swedes with a favorable view of the Sweden Democrats, 40% have a positive opinion of the EU. Among Swedes with an unfavorable view of the party, however, almost three-quarters (74%) see the EU positively. There is a similarly large difference between Germans with a favorable view of AfD (37% view EU favorably) and those with a negative view of the party (70% view EU favorably). Both the AfD and the Sweden Democrats have proposed referendums in their respective countries to vote on EU membership. Positive views of the EU are also less likely among those who favor right-wing populist parties in the Netherlands (Party for Freedom and Forum for Democracy), France (National Rally, formerly National Front), the UK (UKIP) and Italy (League, formerly Northern League, and Five Star Movement). On the other end of the political spectrum, supporters of Spain’s left-wing Podemos party (58%) are also significantly less likely to view the EU positively than are non-supporters (71%). Across the countries surveyed, fewer than half say they approve of the way the EU is handling European economic issues (median of 40%), Brexit (median of 38%) and the refugee issue (median of 23%). Ratings of the EU’s performance, however, vary widely from country to country. A majority in Poland and 52% in both Germany and the Netherlands give the EU a positive rating for its handling of European economic issues. But only one-in-five in Italy and 14% in Greece agree. Between 2017 and 2018, approval ratings related to economic issues only significantly changed in one country: Germany saw a 9-point decrease over that time (61% in 2017 compared with 52% in 2018). Views of the way the EU is handling Brexit are generally more tepid. On the higher end of the range, about half of Dutch (52%) and Germans (51%) approve. Greeks (32%), Italians (31%) and Hungarians (31%) are the least likely to approve. Notably, more than a third of Brits (36%) say they approve of how the EU is handling Brexit. There are no differences between those on the left or the right of the political spectrum in the UK, or between those who favor or do not favor UKIP. Overall, most Europeans do not approve of the way the EU is dealing with the refugee issue in Europe. The Netherlands is the only country where more than a third (37%) support the way the EU is dealing with this issue. Approval is lowest in Italy, Hungary, Sweden and Greece, where fewer than one-in-five approve of the way the EU has handled this issue. In several countries, approval has dropped since 2017, including a 10-point decrease in France and Hungary. Approval of the refugee issue also decreased by 6 points in the Netherlands and Germany and by 5 points in Sweden. Views of how the EU is dealing with the refugee issue are also linked to support for right-wing populist parties. Germans who favor AfD, French who favor National Rally, Dutch who favor the Party for Freedom, Italians who favor the League and Swedes who favor the Sweden Democrats are all significantly less likely to approve of the job the EU is doing with respect to refugees in Europe. Though ratings for the EU are generally positive, views of the European Parliament and European Commission are more divided. A median of 50% have a positive opinion of the European Parliament and 48% view the European Commission favorably. As with attitudes toward the EU more broadly, Poles have some of the most positive views of these institutions while Greeks are much more negative. Roughly two-thirds of Greeks view the European Commission (66%) and Parliament (65%) unfavorably. Evaluations of these European institutions have stayed mostly the same since 2014, when the question was last asked, although ratings have become more favorable in Spain and Italy. For example, in Spain in 2014, roughly a third viewed the European Parliament (32%) and European Commission (30%) positively. In 2018, the share increased to around 50% for both bodies (52% and 51%, respectively). As with views of the EU more broadly, there are ideological divides in opinion of the European Parliament and European Commission. In half of the countries surveyed – Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK – those on the ideological right are less likely to view these two institutions favorably. And people on the left of the spectrum in Spain share this negative sentiment. More than half in every country surveyed believe the EU promotes peace, and eight-in-ten or more express this view in Sweden, Germany and Poland. Roughly half or more in all 10 nations also think the EU promotes democratic values, with the French and Germans especially likely to hold this view. Half or more in seven nations think the EU promotes prosperity. The exceptions include Greece and Italy, two nations that suffered during the European debt crisis. Germany is another exception: The country has performed relatively well economically compared with many other EU nations over the past decade. Opinions about the attributes of the EU have shifted in a more positive direction in France, Italy and Spain since these questions were first asked in 2014. For instance, the share of the public who think the EU promotes prosperity has risen 12 percentage points in France and 10 points in both Italy and Spain. Across the various traits tested, supporters of right-wing populist parties are consistently more likely to associate negative characteristics with the EU. Similarly, those with less education are consistently more likely to describe the EU in negative terms.1 European publics tend to want less immigration. A median of 51% believe their country should allow fewer immigrants or none at all, while 35% think the number of immigrants should stay about the same. Just 10% want more. Though the number of migrant arrivals to Europe via Greece has fallen from its peak in 2015 and 2016, roughly eight-in-ten Greeks believe there should be less immigration into their country. This view is also widespread in Hungary and Italy, two nations where governing parties have embraced an anti-immigration stance. There is little support across European publics to allow more immigrants to move to their countries. Greece (2%), Hungary (2%) and Italy (5%) are particularly resistant. Only in Spain do roughly a quarter (28%) say they should allow more immigrants to move to their country. The European countries included in the survey hold differing views on how immigrants impact society and the economy. A median of 53% say that migrants make their country stronger through their hard work and talents, while 41% believe they take jobs and social benefits. Swedes and Brits are the most positive: Roughly six-in-ten think immigrant talent benefits their country, and half or more in Germany, Spain, France and the Netherlands say the same. But just 5% in Hungary express this view. Opinions on this issue have shifted with time in some countries. Since 2014, more people in France (increase of 11 percentage points), the UK (+10) and Spain (+9) share the view that immigrants strengthen their country. Publics are somewhat divided over the impact of immigration on crime, with a median of 38% believing that immigrants are more to blame for crime than other groups and 45% saying immigrants are no more to blame. The share who say immigrants are more responsible for crime ranges from 22% in France and the UK to 59% in Greece. More Europeans believe immigrants want to be distinct rather than adopt their new countries’ customs. A median of 38% say migrants are willing to adopt their customs and way of life while 51% believe immigrants want to remain distinct from the broader society. A median of 57% say immigration increases the risk of terrorism in their countries, while 38% say it has no impact. Still, in France, Spain and the UK, half or more believe immigration does not increase the odds of terrorism. Even though many people in the nations surveyed say they want less immigration, there is considerable support for accepting both refugees who flee violence (a median of 77%) and immigrants who are highly skilled (64%). At the same time, large shares back deporting immigrants currently in the country illegally (a median of 69%). Majorities in eight of 10 European countries favor taking in refugees, with roughly eight-in-ten or more in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and France expressing this view. Hungarians have the lowest support for this policy, with about a third (32%) who believe refugees should be allowed into the country. Across 10 European countries, ideology drives views of accepting refugees. In Hungary, for example, those on the left are more likely to support taking in refugees (55%) than those on the right (26%). There are also large differences between left-right views in Greece (25 percentage-point gap), Germany (20 points), Poland (20 points) and Sweden (19 points). When asked if highly skilled people from other nations should be encouraged to move to their country, roughly half or more in eight of 10 European countries polled support this approach. Agreement with this policy ranges from 35% in Italy to 88% in Sweden. Education is also linked to views on this issue. In all 10 countries, those with a higher level of education are more likely than those with a lower level of education to support bringing highly skilled people into the country. For example, in France, 78% of those with a postsecondary education or more support high-skilled immigration, compared with 58% of those with a secondary education or less. While Europeans are willing to consider accepting immigrants under certain circumstances, there is also a general sense that immigrants already in the country illegally should be deported. Majorities in seven of 10 countries support this policy. Greeks express the highest level of support for deportations, with 86% agreeing with this policy. Other Europeans have somewhat less support for deporting immigrants in their countries illegally. Among Italians, half favor this policy while 39% are opposed. Publics in France and Spain are split in their views of this practice. Across the 10 European countries surveyed, publics disagree about whether people leaving for jobs in other countries is a problem. Half or more in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and France say this is not a problem, while majorities in Greece, Spain, Italy and Hungary express concern. There is a sense in Europe that while German power is on the rise, French and British power is stagnant or in decline. Across the European countries surveyed, a median of 47% think Germany is playing a more important role in the world than it was 10 years ago. This view is most pronounced in Greece, where 81% say Germany plays a more important role, and just 5% say it has a less important role. Majorities in Spain and Italy also feel Germany plays a more important role today than it has in past. In the Netherlands, France, Sweden and the UK, publics are divided on Germany’s world position, with roughly equal shares saying it has become more important or has remained the same. German views of their country’s status have shifted in the last two years. About half (51%) say their role is more important, down from 62% in 2016. The share who believe their role is as important as it was a decade ago has risen from one quarter in 2016 to 36% in 2018. Younger Germans (those ages 18 to 29) are more likely than Germans ages 50 and older (64% vs. 51%) to think their country has grown in importance. A median of 25% across the 10 European countries polled say France plays a more important role in the world. Views that France’s global position has remained the same are widespread. A plurality in eight of 10 countries say France plays as important a role as it did 10 years ago. French views of their own position in the world have changed over time. Compared with 2016, more in France believe their role in the world has remained the same (43%, up from 30%), while fewer believe their role has diminished (30%, down from 46%). In France, people who place themselves on the ideological right are more likely to say France plays a more important role than those on the left (28% vs. 17%). Similarly, those who express a favorable opinion of President Macron’s En Marche party are more likely to believe French status has grown on the world stage than are those who have a negative view of En Marche (32% vs. 19%, respectively). Meanwhile, those ages 50 and older are more likely to say their country is playing a less important role than those 18 to 29 (36% vs. 22%). When asked about the British role in the world today, European publics tend to believe it is static or in decline. Half or more in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Sweden think the UK plays a less important role than a decade ago. No more than about quarter in any country say the UK’s status has improved. In the UK itself, 39% say their country’s position in the world has diminished in the last 10 years. These views are largely unchanged since 2016. In the UK, those who support the populist UK Independence Party are more likely to say their country’s global status has increased, compared with those who feel unfavorably toward the party (31% vs. 20%, respectively). Meanwhile, Brits with a favorable view of the EU are more likely to say their country plays a less important role in the world than Brits with an unfavorable view of the EU (45% vs. 35%).","Across the European countries surveyed , a median of 47 % think Germany is playing a more important role in the world than it was 10 years ago .

The Democratic coalition is largely united in staunch opposition to President Trump. Yet, while Trump’s election has triggered a wave of political activism within the party’s sizable liberal bloc, the liberals’ sky-high political energy is not nearly as evident among other segments in the Democratic base. And Democrats also are internally divided over U.S. global involvement, as well as some religious and social issues. These are among the findings of Pew Research Center’s new political typology, which sorts Americans into cohesive groups based on their values, attitudes and party affiliation, and provides a unique perspective on the nation’s changing political landscape. Before reading further, take our quiz to see where you fit in the political typology. The political typology reveals that even in a political landscape increasingly fractured by partisanship, the divisions within the Republican and Democratic coalitions may be as important a factor in American politics as the divisions between them. In some cases these fissures are not new – they were evident in six previous Pew Research Center typology studies conducted over the past three decades, most recently in 2014. Yet, especially within the GOP, many of the divisions now center on the issues that have been front-and-center for Trump since he first launched his presidential campaign. This study is based on surveys of more than 5,000 adults conducted over the summer. This was also the data source for our Oct. 6 report, “The Partisan Divide on Political Values Grows Even Wider.” These reports were made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which received support for the surveys from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The political typology finds two distinctly different groups on the right – Core Conservatives and Country First Conservatives, who both overwhelmingly approve of Trump, but disagree on much else – including immigration and whether it benefits the U.S. to be active internationally. Core Conservatives, who are in many ways the most traditional group of Republicans, have an outsized influence on the GOP coalition; while they make up just 13% of the public – and about a third (31%) of all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – they constitute a much larger share (43%) of politically engaged Republicans. This financially comfortable, male-dominated group overwhelmingly supports smaller government, lower corporate tax rates and believes in the fairness of the nation’s economic system. And a large majority of Core Conservatives (68%) express a positive view of U.S. involvement in the global economy “because it provides the U.S. with new markets and opportunities for growth.” Country First Conservatives, a much smaller segment of the GOP base, are older and less educated than other Republican-leaning typology groups. Unlike Core Conservatives, Country First Conservatives are unhappy with the nation’s course, highly critical of immigrants and deeply wary of U.S. global involvement. Nearly two-thirds of Country First Conservatives (64%) – the highest share of any typology group, right or left – say that “if America is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.” A third Republican group, Market Skeptic Republicans, sharply diverges from the GOP’s traditional support for business and lower taxes. Only about a third of Market Skeptic Republicans (34%) say banks and other financial institutions have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, lowest among Republican-leaning typology groups. Alone among the groups in the GOP coalition, a majority of Market Skeptic Republicans support raising tax rates on corporations and large businesses. An overwhelming share (94%) say the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests, which places the view of Market Skeptic Republicans on this issue much closer to Solid Liberals (99% mostly unfair) than Core Conservatives (21%). In contrast to Market Skeptic Republicans, New Era Enterprisers are fundamentally optimistic about the state of the nation and its future. They are more likely than any other typology group to say the next generation of Americans will have it better than people today. Younger and somewhat less overwhelmingly white than the other GOP-leaning groups, New Era Enterprisers are strongly pro-business and generally think that immigrants strengthen, rather than burden, the country. The four groups in the Democratic coalition differ on a number of issues: While they all strongly support the social safety net, the Democratic-leaning groups are divided on government regulation of business, and government performance more generally. And like the GOP coalition, they disagree on U.S. global involvement. While there have long been racial, ethnic and income differences within the Democratic coalition, these gaps are especially striking today. Reflecting the changing demographic composition of the Democratic base, for the first time there are two majority-minority Democratic-leaning typology groups, along with two more affluent, mostly white groups. Solid Liberals are the largest group in the Democratic coalition, and they make up close to half (48%) of politically engaged Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Largely white, financially comfortable and highly educated (most are college graduates and nearly a third have postgraduate degrees), Solid Liberals overwhelmingly express liberal attitudes on virtually every issue. And their level of political activism in the months following Trump’s election sets Solid Liberals apart from all other groups in the political typology, left or right. Nearly half of Solid Liberals (49%) say they have contributed money to a political candidate or campaign in the past year; no more than a third in any other group (32% of Core Conservatives) say the same. And 39% of Solid Liberals report they have participated in a protest against Trump’s policies, which also is by far the highest share among the political typology groups. For the most part, Opportunity Democrats agree with Solid Liberals on major issues. But Opportunity Democrats are less affluent, less politically engaged and less liberal – both in their attitudes on issues and in how they describe themselves politically. One area of difference between Opportunity Democrats and Solid Liberals is on corporate profits: 40% of Opportunity Democrats say most corporations make a “fair and reasonable amount of profit,” compared with 16% of Solid Liberals. And Opportunity Democrats stand out in their belief that most people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard. Disaffected Democrats have very positive feelings toward the Democratic Party and its leading figures. Their disaffection stems from their cynicism about politics, government and the way things are going in the country. This financially stressed, majority-minority group supports activist government and the social safety net, but most say government is “wasteful and inefficient.” A large majority of Disaffected Democrats say their side has been losing in politics, while fewer than half believe that voting gives them a say in how the government runs things. A second majority-minority group, Devout and Diverse, faces even tougher financial hardships than Disaffected Democrats. Devout and Diverse also are the most politically mixed typology group (about a quarter lean Republican), as well as the least politically engaged. Like Disaffected Democrats, they are critical of government regulation of business. They also are the most religiously observant Democratic-leaning group, and the only one in which a majority (64%) says it is necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values. In addition to the eight main groups in the political typology, a ninth group – the Bystanders – is missing in action politically. Almost no one in this relatively young, largely minority group is registered to vote and most pay little or no attention to politics and government. While both parties are divided internally, partisanship remains a defining feature of American political life. Across the eight main typology groups, majorities either affiliate with or lean toward either the Republican or Democratic Party. The power of partisanship is reflected in attitudes about Donald Trump. In the survey, conducted in June, Trump’s job ratings are more deeply polarized along partisan lines than those of any president in more than 60 years. Overall, Trump gets his most positive ratings among the two most solidly Republican groups, Core Conservatives and Country First Conservatives. Large majorities in each group strongly approve of Trump’s job performance (80% of Core Conservatives, 71% of Country First Conservatives). By contrast, more than 70% in the three overwhelmingly Democratic groups (Solid Liberals, Opportunity Democrats and Disaffected Democrats) strongly disapprove. However, even the Republican-leaning groups who strongly approve of Trump’s job performance are not all that positive about his conduct as president. Among the public overall, 58% say they don’t like Trump’s conduct, while just 16% like his conduct; 25% say they have mixed feelings. There is no typology group in which a clear majority expresses positive views of Trump’s conduct. About half of Country First Conservatives (51%) like Trump’s conduct as president, while 39% have mixed feelings. And among Core Conservatives, who strongly approve of Trump’s job performance, only 41% like his conduct and 51% have mixed feelings. The other GOP-leaning groups are divided in views of Trump’s conduct. About half of Market Skeptic Republicans (49%) say they have mixed feelings, while roughly equal shares say they like (24%) and don’t like (26%) his conduct. And among New Era Enterprisers, more express negative (39%) than positive (23%) views of Trump’s conduct, with 38% expressing mixed feelings. Among Democratic-leaning groups, overwhelming majorities of Solid Liberals (98%), Opportunity Democrats (86%) and Disaffected Democrats (89%) say they don’t like Trump’s conduct in office. As with Trump’s job approval, Devout and Diverse offer less critical views of Trump’s conduct, though far more express negative (52%) than positive views (10%). The two largest groups in the political typology – Core Conservatives on the right and Solid Liberals on the left – make up an even larger share of their partisan coalitions when political engagement is factored in. Core Conservatives are more likely than other GOP-leaning groups to say they follow politics and government most of the time and say they always vote. Consequently, while Core Conservatives make up about a third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents overall (31%), they constitute a larger proportion of politically engaged Republicans (43%). At the other end of the political typology, Solid Liberals constitute by far the largest proportion of politically engaged Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Solid Liberals make up a third of all Democrats and Democratic leaners – but close to half (48%) of politically engaged Democrats. That is about the same proportion as the other Democratic-leaning groups combined. The next largest group, Disaffected Democrats, make up 23% of Democrats and about the same share of politically engaged Democrats (20%); similarly, Opportunity Democrats constitute 20% of all Democrats and an identical share of politically engaged Democrats. And Devout and Diverse, who express very low levels of interest in politics and government, make up a substantially smaller share of politically engaged Democrats (7%) than of all Democrats (11%). The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away, but the two groups at either end of the political typology are already highly motivated by the battle for congressional control. More than eight-in-ten Solid Liberals (84%) say it matters a great deal to them which party wins control of Congress next year, the highest share of any typology group. Core Conservatives are next highest, at 77%. At this point, other groups are less engaged by the struggle for partisan control of Congress. And the drop-off is particularly notable among three groups close to the middle of the typology. On the right, fewer than half of Market Skeptic Republicans (44%) and New Era Enterprisers (41%) say it matters a great deal which party wins control of Congress; on the left, just 44% of Devout and Diverse say the same. The political typology sorts Americans into cohesive, like-minded groups based on their values and beliefs, as well as their partisan affiliation. The current study, which comes 30 years after the first political typology, is based on surveys conducted June 8-18 among 2,504 adults and June 27-July 9 among 2,505 adults, with a follow-up survey conducted Aug. 15-21 among 1,893 respondents. The typology is not intended to measure changes over time in the electorate, but some of the internal party differences that were evident 30 years ago still persist today. For example, Core Conservatives are far more likely than Country First Conservatives to favor societal acceptance of homosexuality. In 1987, two roughly parallel groups – Enterprise Republicans and Moral Republicans – differed over a disputed social policy at that time, whether or not school boards should have the right to fire homosexual teachers. There also have been long-standing divisions among Democratic groups over religion and morality. Today’s Solid Liberals, who overwhelmingly say that belief in God is not necessary to be moral, bear some resemblance to the Seculars and ’60s Democrats from that earlier era. Today’s Disaffected Democrats and Devout and Diverse – majority-minority groups who are much more likely than Solid Liberals to link belief in God with morality – are somewhat similar to the Partisan Poor and Passive Poor of three decades ago. To be sure, there have been seismic changes in the nation and politics over the past three decades – and these are reflected in the political typology. The country has become far more racially and ethnically diverse. In 1987, both parties were overwhelmingly white and non-Hispanic; today, only the GOP is, while more than 40% of Democrats are nonwhite. Thirty years ago, one of the largest groups in the political typology were the New Dealers, an older, mostly white, mostly Democratic group who were relatively conservative on social issues but favored activist government. There is no equivalent group in today’s political typology. There have been more recent changes as well, particularly in the GOP coalition. The two conservative Republican groups are divided over immigration, “openness” and America’s role in the world, as well as homosexuality. And for the first time, there is a Republican-leaning group that is deeply skeptical of business and the fundamental fairness of the nation’s economic system. On these issues, Market Skeptic Republicans have less in common with the other groups on the right than they do with the Democratic-leaning groups in the political typology.","The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away , but the two groups at either end of the political typology are already highly motivated by the battle for congressional control .

In a trend that is both a consequence of and contributor to its financial woes, the island’s population is also declining at a clip not seen in more than 60 years. It’s not a new problem: Puerto Rico’s population began declining in 2006 and has continued every year through 2013, while the population of Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland has grown, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. But the island’s population decline has accelerated in recent years. Over a two-year period between 2011 and 2013, Puerto Rico’s net population decreased by 50,000 people annually. Job-related reasons were cited by 42% of those leaving. According to a new report commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, not only has the island’s population decline been a drag on its economy, but it will hinder the commonwealth’s ability to recover. If people can’t find jobs at home, they move elsewhere in search of work. And fewer workers means less productive capacity and lower consumer demand down the road. The population decline has included young people. Enrollment in Puerto Rico’s elementary schools and high schools has declined 40% over the past decade, the report said. “Structural problems, economic shocks and weak public finances have yielded a decade of stagnation, outmigration and debt,” the report said. “Even if there is no intensification in economic problems, which is a big if, the [Puerto Rico] Planning Board projects that the population will continue to fall through 2020.” The island’s economy, as measured by real gross national product, has declined in tandem with its population. It shrank in seven of the past eight years, and is now 13% smaller than it was in fiscal 2006, according to data from the Government Development Bank. Unemployment stood at 12.4% in May, more than twice the national jobless rate; the share of the population either working or looking for work has sunk to 39.6%, from 48.1% in July 2006. (By comparison, the U.S. labor force participation rate was 62.9% in May.) In terms of population, the downward trend looks like it won’t be turning around anytime soon. The latest projections from the U.S. Census Bureau show the island’s population will continue to shrink, from 3.6 million today down to 3 million in 2050. Another driver of the island’s population loss is falling fertility. In 2013, the average woman in Puerto Rico was estimated to have 1.3 children during her lifetime, a measure called the total fertility rate. A decade ago, the fertility rate was 1.9. Historically, fertility has dropped during economic recessions. By comparison, women born in Puerto Rico who move to the U.S. mainland have more babies than those who stay on the island. In 2013, the average total fertility rate was 2.1 for Puerto Rican-born women living in the U.S.","But the island ’s population decline has accelerated in recent years .

And while there are some signs of tension between Europe’s majority populations and its Muslim minorities, Muslims there do not generally believe that most Europeans are hostile toward people of their faith. Still, over a third of Muslims in France and one-in-four in Spain say they have had a bad experience as a result of their religion or ethnicity. However, there is little evidence of a widespread backlash against Muslim immigrants among the general publics in Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. Majorities continue to express concerns about rising Islamic identity and extremism, but those worries have not intensified in most of the countries surveyed over the past 12 months; a turbulent period that included the London subway bombings, the French riots, and the Danish cartoon controversy. Opinions held by Muslims in Europe – as well as opinions about Muslims among Europe’s majority populations – vary significantly by country. No clear European point of view emerges with regard to the Muslim experience, either among Muslims or in the majority populations on many issues. Most notably, France shows no signs of a backlash in response to last year’s riots. In fact, a counter trend seems to have emerged with slightly more French people saying that immigration from the Middle East and North Africa is a good thing than did so a year ago. The French public is also more inclined this year to say that Muslims living in France want to adopt French customs – a view held by an overwhelming majority of Muslims in France. Nor do German and British publics express any increase in negative views of immigrants – although, unlike the French, they are not more positive toward immigrants this year. Meanwhile, the Spanish public’s view toward immigrants has grown slightly more negative over the last year. But in Britain worries about Islamic extremism are intense among both the general public and the Muslim minority population as well. Concerns about the problem rose markedly this year among the general public. And worries about extremism within the British Muslim community are greater than in France, Germany, and Spain. The survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project was conducted in 13 countries, including the United States, from March 31-May 14, 2006.1 It includes special oversamples of Muslim minorities living in Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. The poll finds that Muslims themselves are generally positive about conditions in their host nation. In fact, they are more positive than the general publics in all four European countries about the way things are going in their countries. However, many Muslims, especially in Britain, worry about the future of Muslims in their country. The greatest concern among Muslim minorities in all four countries is unemployment. Islamic extremism emerges as the number-two worry generally, a concern shared by Western publics as well as Muslims in Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan. The decline in the importance of religion, adoption of modern roles by women, and influences of popular culture upon youth are generally lower-ranked concerns. Overall, British Muslims express the greatest level of concern about the issues tested. The majority of European Muslims do not see many or most Europeans as hostile towards Muslims. But substantial numbers of Muslims do perceive such hostility. This belief is most widespread in Germany, where more than half of both Muslims and the general public see many or most Germans as hostile toward Muslims. At the same time, however, German Muslims are the least likely to report personal experiences with discrimination. German Muslims are also far more inclined than those elsewhere in Europe to see new immigrants as wanting to be distinct – 52% take this view – and German nationals overwhelmingly (76%) share this view. In contrast, in France, 78% of Muslims say that Muslims there want to adopt French customs, though 53% of the general public feels that French Muslims want to remain distinct. European Muslims show signs of favoring a moderate version of Islam. With the exception of Spanish Muslims, they tend to see a struggle being waged between moderates and Islamic fundamentalists. Among those who see an ongoing conflict, substantial majorities in all four countries say they generally side with the moderates. Most French and British Muslims think women are better off in their countries than in most Muslim countries. About half of German and Spanish Muslims agree, and very few think women actually have it better in most Muslim countries. Moreover, most are not concerned about Muslim women in Europe taking on modern roles in society (although substantial minorities worry about this). Religion is central to the identity of European Muslims. With the exception of Muslims in France, they tend to identify themselves primarily as Muslim rather than as British, Spanish, or German. In France, Muslims are split almost evenly on this question. The level of Muslim identification in Britain, Spain, and Germany is similar to that in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Jordan, and even higher than levels in Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. By contrast the general populations in Western Europe are far more secular in outlook. Roughly six-in-ten in Spain, Germany, and Britain identify primarily with their country rather than their religion, as do more than eight-in-ten in France. Americans, however, split about evenly on this question: 42% say they first think of themselves as Christians versus 48% who think of themselves primarily as Americans – a divide close to that found among French Muslims. Muslims in Europe are most sharply distinguished from the majority populations on opinions about external issues – America, the war on terrorism, Iran, the Middle East.2 European Muslims give the United States lower favorability ratings than do general publics in Europe, and in particular, they give the American people lower ratings. The war on terror is extremely unpopular among minority Muslim populations – German Muslims register the highest level of support, at 31%. While Iran is viewed unfavorably in Western Europe and the United States, it receives very positive marks from British and Spanish Muslims, while French and German Muslims are divided. European Muslims take a much more positive view of the Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections in January than do the majority populations, and perhaps not surprisingly, they are also much more likely to side with Palestinians in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In general, European Muslim opinions on external issues are quite similar to those expressed in predominantly Muslim countries. The report’s detailed findings are presented below. A description of the Pew Global Attitudes Project can be found at the end of the report, along with a summary of the survey’s methodology and complete topline results. Despite concerns about an anti-Muslim backlash in the wake of a string of highly publicized events involving Muslims living in Europe – subway bombings in London, controversy over Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, rioting by Muslim youth in France – most Muslims living in Europe do not feel that most or even many Europeans are hostile toward people of their faith. Indeed, European Muslims are, in general, more satisfied with national conditions than are the general publics of these countries. Substantial majorities of Muslims living in the European countries surveyed say that in the last two years they have not had any personally bad experience attributable to their race, ethnicity or religion. In France, however, where riots last fall pitted Muslim youth against French police, 37% of Muslims report a bad encounter, while in Britain 28% report being the target of discrimination. Muslims in Spain are the least concerned about European anti-Muslim sentiment – fewer than a third (31%) say most or many Europeans have hostile attitudes compared with 64% who see only some or very few as hostile. In Great Britain, 42% of Muslims judge that many or most of their European hosts are unfriendly, while in France, 39% of resident Muslims share that view. Only in Germany does a narrow 51%-majority of resident Muslims view most (22%) or many (29%) Europeans as hostile. In some of the European host countries surveyed, the general public agrees precisely with these assessments. In Great Britain, 40% of the public sees most or many of their fellow countrymen as hostile to Muslims compared with 42% of British Muslims taking that view; in Germany, 63% of the larger public agrees with the 51% of Muslims who see most or many of their hosts as hostile. But in France a considerably larger number among the public (56%) see substantial hostility toward Muslims than do Muslims themselves (39%). And in Spain, nearly twice as many in the overall population (60%) see most or many Europeans as hostile to Muslims as do Spanish Muslim, only 31% of whom share that view. One of the biggest perception gaps exists in Nigeria. There 28% of Christians say most or many Europeans are hostile toward Muslims, compared with 50% of Nigerian Muslims who believe this. Muslims in the Mideast and Asia judge European hostility to be considerably more widespread than do European Muslims. As many as 63% in Egypt, 61% in Pakistan, 57% in Turkey and 50% in Jordan say that most or many Europeans are hostile to Muslims. The poll finds little evidence of a general rise in anti-immigration sentiment. With the continuing exception of Germany, majorities in the European countries surveyed say it is a “good thing” that people from the Middle East and North Africa came to work in their countries. These levels of acceptance are essentially unchanged from those recorded a year earlier. However, in France a somewhat greater percentage now call such immigration a good thing, while in Spain a somewhat smaller percentage say it is good. Germany is the outlier in this regard with only 34% of Germans calling immigration from the Middle East and North Africa a good thing compared with 59% who deem it a bad thing. However, Germans are no more welcoming to those migrating from Eastern Europe; only 36% call such immigration a good thing. Across the board, immigrants from Eastern Europe are no more and no less welcome than those from predominantly Muslim countries. In Great Britain, Spain, and France, as in Germany, the numbers among the general public calling immigration from Eastern Europe a good thing are virtually identical to those expressing approval of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa. More European Muslims approve of immigration from the Middle East and North Africa into the country where they now reside than do the general populations of those countries. Among Muslims in Great Britain, fully 75% call such immigration a good thing; in France, 83% and in Spain, 85%. Germany again is the exception, with Muslims there splitting 42%-46% on the good-bad question, although the 42% of Muslim approvers is still significantly higher than the 34% of the general public that agrees with that judgment. Although most European Muslims are satisfied with the general direction of the countries they live in, large majorities are still concerned about the future of Muslims in their country. British Muslims are the most concerned – eight-in-ten (80%) are at least somewhat concerned including about half (49%) who are very concerned. French Muslims follow closely behind in their anxiety, with 72% saying they are either very (38%) or somewhat (34%) concerned. The numbers of Muslims very concerned about the future are somewhat lower in Germany (28%) and Spain (30%) although substantial majorities in both countries say they are at least somewhat worried as they look ahead. Of the issues tested in the survey, unemployment is the biggest concern of European Muslims, with majorities in the mid-50% range in France, Germany and Spain and a 46%-plurality in Britain saying they are very worried about joblessness. In addition, between a quarter and a third of the remaining Muslim samples express at least some concern on this issue. Muslims in Britain emerge as the most worried on every other issue tested, with 45% very worried about the decline of the importance of religion among their co-religionists, 44% very concerned about the influence of the secular culture (movies, music and television) on their youth, and, to a lesser but still leading degree, the adoption of modern roles in society by Muslim women (22% very concerned). Elsewhere in Europe these issues – especially the emergence of women – engender intense concern among relatively few Muslims. In fact, not only is the entry of women into modern roles of little or no concern to most European Muslims, it is apparently welcomed by many. About six-in-ten British and French Muslims, and about half of German and Spanish Muslims, believe the quality of life is better for women in their countries than in most Muslim countries. In all four countries, the share of Muslims saying women in their countries are worse off is less than 20%. Muslim women in Europe are slightly more likely than men to see the quality of life as better for women in their country than in most Muslim countries. However, in Spain Muslim women were considerably more likely than men to believe this. Extremism among European Muslims is a common source of worry among Muslim minorities in Europe. In particular, Muslims in Great Britain are very concerned. As many express concerns about this (44%) as are very worried about unemployment. Extremism is of somewhat less concern in France (30% very worried), Germany (23%) and Spain (22%), although in all these countries more than four-in-ten Muslims say they are at least somewhat concerned. Most Europeans doubt that Muslims coming into their countries want to adopt their national customs and way of life. Substantial majorities in Germany (76%), Great Britain (64%), Spain (67%) and Russia (69%) say that Muslims in their country want to remain distinct from the larger society. Fewer French, but still a 53%-majority, agree. However, the percentage of the general public in France that believes newly arrived Muslims want to blend into the French way of life has increased significantly since last year. In the 2005 survey only 36% of the French public said that Muslims want to adopt the French way of life while 59% said they want to remain distinct; now 46% say adopt, 53% say remain distinct. For their part, Muslims in France, Great Britain, and Spain are substantially more likely than their general publics to say that Muslims want to adopt the customs and way of life of the country into which they immigrate. Indeed, nearly eight-in-ten French Muslims (78%) believe this. Again, Germany is different: Only 30% of German Muslims think Muslims coming into that country today want to assimilate – most say they want to be separate and most Germans agree. Perceptions of the strength of Islamic identity among Muslims have changed little over the year. Substantial majorities in both Western Europe and the United States continue to believe Muslims in their country have a very or fairly strong sense of Islamic identity. European Muslims’ perceptions largely match those of the general public, with the exception of Germany. While 84% of the German public sees Muslims having a strong Islamic identity, only 46% of Muslims living in Germany agree. As to whether that sense of Islamic identity is increasing, strong majorities among the general publics in Great Britain (69%), France (68%), and Germany (72% – up from 66% in 2005) say that it is (as do 69% in India and 56% in Russia). In Spain, however, only a 46%-plurality sees an intensifying Islamic identity – a view shared by Muslims in that country. Muslims in Great Britain, however, are the most likely of all groups sampled to see a strengthening of Islamic identity with fully 77% agreeing. In France and Germany, by contrast, the proportion of Muslims who see Islamic identity intensifying (58% and 54%, respectively) is smaller than among the general public. European Muslims who think Islamic identity is growing tend to consider it a good thing. This is especially so in Great Britain, where 86% say the perceived intensifying trend is a good thing, and Spain where 75% agree. Most Westerners (as well as Indians) strongly disagree. Among those in the French general public who see Islamic identity on the rise, 87% call it a bad thing; in Germany, 83% say so; in Spain (82%); in India, 78%. For those in the United States, Western Europe, Russia and India who see growing Islamic identity as a bad thing, the primary concern cited is that it may lead to violence. However, many are also worried that it may keep Muslims from integrating into the larger society. For Muslims in Germany who see growing Islamic identity as worrisome, concern about retarding integration is paramount for 58%, while fewer than one-in-five worry about violence. Among French Muslims, concerns are spilt between violence (40%) and integration (45%). In most countries, an attendant loss of freedom tended to be of lesser concern. For guidance on religious matters, Muslims in Europe, as well as in most of the larger Islamic world, turn to their local Imam, as well as to national and international religious leaders. Local religious leaders are especially consulted in Nigeria, where 64% of Muslims see them as the most trustworthy source of guidance; in Indonesia, where 60% do so; and in Pakistan and Great Britain where more than four-in-ten Muslims do so. The only countries in which large numbers – about one-in-four – turn first to religious leaders on television are the two Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan. Large percentages of Muslims in Europe say they think of themselves first as a Muslim rather than as a citizen of their country. The tendency is strongest in Great Britain where 81% in the Muslim oversample self-identify as Muslim rather than British, while in Spain 69% do so and in Germany 66%. In sharp contrast, Muslims living in France are far less likely to identify first with their faith rather their nationality. While a 46%-plurality identifies first as a Muslim, a nearly equal 42% see themselves as primarily French, while an additional 10% say both equally. The levels seen in Britain, Spain, and Germany are comparable to those seen in most of the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed. In Pakistan, 87% primarily identify as Muslims; in Jordan, 67% do so. In Nigeria, 71% of Muslims see themselves as Muslims first, whereas a smaller 53%-majority of Christians primarily identify with their faith. In Turkey a slight 51%-majority now self-identifies as Muslim rather than Turkish, although this is a substantial rise from the 43% who did so in 2005. Among Muslim countries in the survey, only in Indonesia does the public split 39%-36% between primary national and religious identity, with 25% selecting both equally. By contrast, Christians in European countries overwhelmingly self-identify with their respective nationalities rather than with their faith. And in India, fully 90% of the public self-identifies as Indian rather than Hindu. Indeed, among non-Muslim nations, the United States is the outlier in terms of religious self-identification with the public closely split on the question of primary identification. Fully 42% of U.S. Christians say they think of themselves as Christians first rather than as Americans, compared with 48% who self-identify primarily as Americans; an additional 7% say both equally. The poll found no overall rise in concern about extremism among the general publics of nations with Muslim minorities. The percentage of the general public very worried about Islamic extremism was greater this year in the U.S., Britain, and Germany; however, it was unchanged in France and considerably lower in Spain and Russia. Germans are the most concerned about rising Islamic extremism in their country with 82% of the general public saying they are very (40%) or somewhat (42%) concerned. However, concern was nearly as high a year ago when 78% of Germans expressed such concern including 35% who then said they were very concerned. Great Britain, however, has seen an increase in worries about Islamic extremism over the last year, with 77% of the public now saying they are very (42%) or somewhat (35%) concerned. Strikingly, these concerns are largely shared by Muslims living in Britain, among whom 43% say they are very concerned and 26% say they are somewhat concerned. In France, despite that country’s recent experience with riots, worry about Islamic extremism has remained essentially stable over the last year (76% of the public is at least somewhat concerned including 30% very concerned). And in Spain and Russia, such concerns have declined considerably. As in Great Britain, most Muslims in France and Germany are also worried about extremism. However, Muslims in Spain are divided on this issue, with 46% expressing at least some concern and 49% expressing little or no concern. By contrast, in the predominantly Muslim countries of Egypt, Pakistan, and Jordan large majorities (68%, 74%, and 69%, respectively) are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism in those countries. And in India, with its substantial Muslim minority, 85% of the predominately Hindu public expresses such concern, essentially the same number as did so last year. In Nigeria the level of concern is somewhat lower – a small majority (54%) of the public worries about Islamic extremism there. Muslims in Nigeria are significantly more likely than Christians to be concerned about Islamic extremism. Consistent with these concerns, majorities or pluralities of Muslims in Britain (58%), France (56%), and Germany (49%) believe there is a struggle in their country between moderates and Islamic fundamentalists. Again, Spanish Muslims differ from their European counterparts, with a majority (65%) saying they do not see such a struggle, a view they share with 60% of Nigerian Muslims. In all four European countries – and especially in France – those who do see a struggle heavily side with the moderates. In Nigeria, however, Muslims split evenly on this question. Awareness of last year’s riots in France is relatively high among both the general publics and Muslim minorities in Western Europe, ranging among the general population from 91% in Germany to 78% in Spain and among Muslims from 86% in Germany to 63% in Britain. In Japan, 89% had heard the news. Those who had heard about the riots were less numerous in the United States (55%) and in the Muslim world. In Turkey, 61% had heard about the riots, in Jordan 47%. But awareness levels in other Muslim countries ranged downward from 35% in Egypt, to 23% in Nigeria, 18% in Indonesia and 11% in Pakistan. By and large, European Muslims – irrespective of their views about the riots per se – say they are sympathetic to the youths from immigrant and working class suburbs in France who felt frustrated by their place in French society. Muslims in Great Britain are most sympathetic (75% so indicate) followed by those in France and Spain (63% of Muslims in both countries). In Germany, however, more among the general public (64%) express sympathy than among the predominantly Turkish Muslims in that country, 53% of whom say they sympathize with the frustrations of French youth. In general, Western publics are divided on this issue – only 37% of the Spanish public sympathizes with the French youth. And despite more positive French views on many related issues this year, only 46% of the French general public takes the side of the country’s alienated young. Regarding publication of cartoons featuring the prophet Mohammad in a Danish newspaper, the most common way in which people heard about the controversy that ensued was through television, although in Nigeria people were more likely to hear of it via radio or through family and friends. Few in any country mentioned a church or mosque or the internet as the source of their awareness.","The levels seen in Britain , Spain , and Germany are comparable to those seen in most of the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed .

About one-in-three Americans (32%) say they are very closely following news about the deadly typhoon that struck the Philippines on Nov. 8. By comparison, 55% of the public closely followed the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan, 58% followed the tsunami that struck coastlines around the Indian Ocean at the end of 2004, and 60% followed the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the new national survey, conducted Nov. 14-17 among 1,013 adults, Typhoon Haiyan tied with economic news as the second-most closely followed story this week. The health care rollout was the public’s top story, with 37% following it very closely. Attention to the Philippines typhoon is similar to the levels of interest in the 2008 earthquake in China (30% followed closely) and the 2010 earthquake in Chile (27%). Up to this point, the share of Americans making donations to the Philippines trails donations to natural disasters that got more attention: 14% say they have donated to storm relief efforts. The share of the public that has donated so far is somewhat less than after the disasters in Haiti, Japan or the Indian Ocean. In the past, many have donated to relief causes after the first week. For instance, after the earthquake in Haiti, far more said they donated in a survey conducted after 3-4 weeks (52%) than had said they donated in the first several days (18%). Currently, in addition to the 14% who say they have already made a donation, another 17% say they plan to. But two-thirds (67%) say they do not think they will donate right now. Compared with some of these other previous international disasters, interest in the typhoon is lower across all age groups. Among adults 65 and older, 45% followed Haiyan very closely last week, compared to the 67% who closely monitored the Japanese tsunami. Interest has been particularly low among adults younger than 40, just 20% of whom have followed the aftermath in the Philippines last week, compared to the 47% who tracked news from Japan in 2011. Among the 14% of adults who have donated so far, about twice as many donated via traditional means than over the internet or via text message. Roughly three-in-ten people who donated to relief efforts did so digitally (31%), while 63% donated in person, over the phone or through the mail. The primary means of digital donations was over the internet (22% of all donors), with just 7% donating by text message. Fully half (51%) of donors say they gave in person, such as at church. These patterns of donations are similar to other recent disaster relief efforts, with no growth in the share using digital donation tools. For more on donations and interest in past foreign natural disasters, see “Most Are Attentive to News About Disaster in Japan,” March 22, 2011. And for a detailed study of donors to the “Text to Haiti” campaign, see “Real Time Charitable Giving,” Jan. 12, 2012. The most closely followed story this week was the ongoing rollout of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with 37% saying they followed reports “very closely.” Roughly equal shares of Republicans (43%) and Democrats (36%) followed health care news closely. Since the Oct. 1 launch date of the health care exchanges, there has been sustained public interest. But interest among younger adults continues to lag: About one-in-four (24%) of those under 30 and 30% of those 30-49 followed health care news very closely. By comparison, about half of adults 50 and older (49%) closely followed the rollout. About one-in-three followed news about Typhoon Haiyan and the U.S. economy very closely (32% each). In its second week in the headlines, bullying accusations within the Miami Dolphins football team were followed by 14% of the public. Men (17%) are more likely than women (11%) to say they followed the story very closely. Americans express relatively limited interest in news about Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, as well as news about new guidelines for the use of statins or the FDA’s proposal to severely limit the use of artificial trans fats.","The aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines is drawing less attention from the American public than a number of other major international disasters in recent years .

Each week, the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press conducts national public opinion surveys to measure which news subjects are receiving the most public attention, while the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism analyzes news coverage. For an analysis of the year’s news coverage, see “The Year in News 2010: Disaster, Economic Anxiety, but Little Interest in War” released January 11, 2011. The public and news media were largely on the same page during the peak moments of the year’s biggest breaking news stories – the disaster in Haiti, the passage of health care legislation, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the outcome of the midterm elections. (See “Top Stories of 2010: Haiti Earthquake, Gulf Oil Spill” Dec. 21, 2010.) In most cases, the public and news media’s priorities were in sync. At their peak intensity, each of these stories filled over 40% of the week’s newshole, according to PEJ’s News Coverage Index, and was the most closely followed story that week by more than 40% – and in several instances about 60% – of the public, according the Pew Research Center’s News Interest Index. But there were moments, and stories, when the public’s interests diverged substantially from the press’ coverage. And those discrepancies, moreover, tended to fit a broader pattern. In general, the public tended to maintain its interest in major breaking news stories considerably longer than the press did. And the press tended to maintain substantially more interest in Washington Beltway controversies than did its audience. Most notably, in the weeks following three of these major news events – the Haiti disaster, the passage of health care legislation, and the capping of the gulf oil spill – public interest remained high long after the news media’s focus had turned elsewhere. And while public interest in the 2010 midterm elections was on par with press coverage in the final stages of the campaign season, coverage far exceeded public interest earlier in the campaign cycle. Over the course of 2010, seven of nine cases in which coverage far exceeded public interest involved stories that had far greater resonance inside the Beltway than outside. These included the firing of General Stanley McChrystal, the release by WikiLeaks of classified State Department documents, Scott Brown’s winning the Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election, and the firing of Shirley Sherrod, a former U.S. agriculture department employee. Notably, several of these stories involved the media itself. These included: McChrystal and his staff’s being quoted criticizing the administration in Rolling Stone magazine, WikiLeaks raising questions about press responsibilities, and video of Sherrod being shown repeatedly out of its full context after being picked up from a conservative website. One story where the public and the media were often in sync was the economy. Coverage of economic news was consistently high from week to week and cumulatively represented the single largest story over the course of 2010. Public interest was also notably consistent. In every week public interest in economic news was measured, at least 30% of Americans said they were following reports about the condition of the economy very closely, and, aside from periods of peak interest in Haiti, the health care debate and the Gulf oil spill, at least 10% said the economy was the story they were following more closely than any other. Economic news received the most or second most public attention in 32 of the 45 weeks in which public attention to the topic was tracked. While the economy topped the news over the course of the whole year, 2010 was marked by a series of other major stories that received overwhelming levels of news coverage and public interest as well. The year began with a devastating earthquake in Haiti, followed by end game in the fight over sweeping health care legislation, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Republicans’ victories in the midterm elections. At their peak, each of these stories dominated press coverage – accounting for more than 40% of the newshole in a single week. And at these moments, public interest was commensurately high. Fully 66% of Americans said they were following the debate over health care more closely than any other news the week of March 22-28, and 63% were focused on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico the week of June 14-20. Immediately following the earthquake in Haiti, 57% of Americans followed news about the aftermath more closely than any other story, and in the week following the 2010 midterms, 43% of Americans said that was their top news interest. While press and public interests coincided at these peak moments, the news media and public did not concur continuously about the importance of these news stories. Most importantly, the public stayed focused on three of these stories – the disaster in Haiti, health care reform and the gulf oil spill – long after media attention had shifted to other emerging stories. Just three weeks after the most intense focus on the Haiti earthquake, coverage of the aftermath comprised just 8% of the newshole, replaced by press coverage of the economy and possible problems with Toyota vehicles. Yet the public continued to report more interest in news about the earthquake’s aftermath than either of these other topics – 38% said they were following news about Haiti more closely than anything else. Similarly, less than a month after the July 15th capping of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico, 44% of Americans continued to say they were following news about the spill and its aftermath more closely than any other topic. Yet just 3% of news coverage focused on the spill’s aftermath, as the press focus had turned toward the upcoming midterm elections. And within three weeks of President Obama signing major new health care legislation, the issue filled just 3% of news coverage; there was more coverage of a major mining accident in West Virginia, Obama’s push to place greater controls on the world’s nuclear weapons and Tiger Woods’ return to the PGA. Yet 33% of Americans said they were most interested in news about the new health care law, far more than any of these other stories. Other than stories that affect them personally – such as the debates over health care legislation and tax cuts – Americans often show less interest in political or Washington stories than does the media. That was the case in several instances in 2010, including the forced resignations of Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Shirley Sherrod. The week of June 21, for example, the media devoted 21% of coverage to the termination of McChrystal, then commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Yet fewer than one-in-ten Americans (7%) said they followed the news about McChrystal most closely that week. Instead, 53% of Americans were still focused mostly on developments in the Gulf of Mexico. The week of July 19, the media jumped on a story about the USDA firing an African American official for allegedly making racist comments in a speech. The department quickly changed course, offering Shirley Sherrod her job back, when it became clear her comments had been taken out of context. The story accounted for 14% of the newshole (33% on cable news channels), but just 8% of the public said this was the news they were following most closely. That week, half the public (51%) said they were following news about the Gulf oil spill most closely. Similarly, the political drama of the 2010 midterm elections often drew far more press than public attention. Though the public eventually took a strong interest in the Nov. 2 midterm elections in late October, there were instances earlier in 2010 in which coverage of the primaries significantly outweighed interest. During the week starting Sept. 13, the media devoted 30% of the newshole to election news (42% for cable news channels) – including Christine O’Donnell’s surprise win in the Delaware Republican Senate primary. That week, 11% of the public said they followed election news most closely, while more than twice as many (26%) rated news about the economy as most important to them. This gap between public interest and press coverage continued through September and October, as the election consumed over a quarter of the newshole, but was a second, or even third-tier story in terms of public interest. The elections did not become the top story for the public until the final week before Election Day, and remained the top story for the two weeks following. The ongoing U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq received modest press coverage and public attention over the course of 2010. Aside from spikes in press coverage related to Afghanistan surrounding General McChrystal’s resignation in June and the WikiLeaks release of secret military documents in August, events in Afghanistan and Afghanistan policy received modest press coverage in 2010 – 4% of the news measured by the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Across 18 weeks in which public interest on the topic was measured, roughly a quarter said they were following Afghanistan-related news “very closely”. But Afghanistan was the top news story for fewer than one-in-ten Americans in virtually all of those weeks. Similarly, over the entire course of 2010 1% of news coverage was devoted to Iraq events and policy debates, and in no week did Iraq consume more than 10% of the newshole. Public interest in Iraq news was also modest – in the ten weeks in which public interest in Iraq-related news was tested, roughly a quarter of Americans said they were following “very closely”, but about one-in-ten rated it as the top story they followed most closely. The exception to this came in early September, when 17% said they were following news about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq more closely than any other story. The graphic below plots out the interest and coverage levels for many top weekly stories of the year. For long-running stories, such as the economy or the Gulf oil spill, the numbers have been averaged and are represented by larger square dots. The bold diagonal line represents the typical relationship between coverage and interest across the entire year’s worth of weekly measurements (as defined by a simple regression analysis). Data points above the diagonal line represent stories in which public interest was high relative to the amount of press coverage. Those points below the line show stories in which press coverage was high relative to the amount of public interest. In both directions, the farther a story is from the line, the greater the gap between interest and coverage. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Monday through Sunday) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week. (For more information about the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, go to www.journalism.org.) The News Interest Index survey collects data from Thursday through Sunday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone and cell phone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a national sample of approximately 1,000 adults living in the continental United States, 18 years of age or older. Both the landline and cell phone samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2009 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample is also weighted to match current patterns of telephone status based on extrapolations from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","Similarly , over the entire course of 2010 1 % of news coverage was devoted to Iraq events and policy debates , and in no week did Iraq consume more than 10 % of the newshole .

The forum, originally established to ensure global financial stability, will feature discussions around eight main themes this year, including the global economy, women’s empowerment, and energy and the environment. Pew Research Center conducted public opinion surveys in many of the G20 member nations in 2018. Based on these surveys, here is a look at the way people in these countries view some of the central issues that will be addressed at this year’s summit. G20 leaders previously committed to a 25% reduction in the gap between the shares of men and women participating in their countries’ labor forces by 2025. At this year’s summit, the focus is on including more women in the labor force, enhancing STEM education for women and continuing engagement with women business leaders. Across the G20 nations surveyed in 2018, people are strongly in favor of increased gender equality in their country. The Center asked respondents whether they thought equality between men and women had increased or decreased in their country over the past two decades, followed by a question evaluating whether they saw this as a good or bad thing for their nation. (For more, see “How people around the world view gender equality in their countries.”) Around three-quarters favor more gender equality in India, Australia, South Korea and France. But many among the populations surveyed also see the gender equality landscape as unchanged over the past 20 years. In Japan, for instance, around one-third say that equality between men and women has remained unchanged over the past two decades. The labor force participation rate among women has risen in most G20 countries over the past two decades. In Brazil, for example, 54% of working-age women participated in the labor force in 2018, up from 48% in 1998. Still, in three G20 countries – including the United States – labor force participation among women has declined during this span. Overall, women’s participation in the labor force remains appreciably lower than men’s participation in all G20 members. G20 leaders are planning to discuss how best to address the economic and social impact of technological innovation. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the host of the summit, has expressed interest in using artificial intelligence, robots and big data to achieve a “Society 5.0,” which would involve the integration of cyber (or virtual) space and physical space. When asked whether robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans, roughly nine-in-ten Japanese (89%) said in the Center’s 2018 survey that most jobs will definitely or probably be automated by the year 2050 – a higher share than in many other G20 countries surveyed. The Japanese public also is more likely to see the economic benefits of an automated future: 74% of Japanese adults say the economy would become more efficient if robots and computers were able to do much of the work done by humans – 27 percentage points higher than the share who say this in the second-highest G20 public surveyed (Brazil). Accompanying technological advancements are greater digital security risks – another focus of the G20. People in most surveyed G20 countries say it is likely that cyberattacks will damage public infrastructure like power grids or internet systems. People in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. are especially concerned, with more than eight-in-ten adults in each country saying that such cyberattacks are likely. Assessments of governments’ preparedness for these digital attacks are more varied. Russians are the most confident among G20 nations surveyed in assessing their government’s preparedness, with two-thirds describing their country as being well-prepared to handle a large-scale cyberattack. People in Argentina are least confident, with just 9% saying their government is well-prepared. G20 leaders will also focus this year on climate change, sustainable energy and plastic litter in the ocean. This focus broadly matches public concerns about climate change in the nations surveyed by the Center. In fact, in all but one of the G20 countries surveyed – Russia – majorities say global climate change is a major threat to their nation. South Koreans are the most concerned, with 86% considering it a major threat. At the other end of the spectrum, 43% of Russians see global climate change as a major threat. While climate change ranks as a major threat across many G20 countries, most of the energy in most of these nations still comes from fossil fuels. As of 2014, only France gets less than half of its energy from fossil fuels, according to International Energy Agency Statistics. Fossil fuels also account for a relatively small proportion of Brazil’s energy use (59%). Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Russia and Mexico stand out among G20 nations for their comparatively heavy use of fossil fuels: In all these countries, over 90% of energy comes from fossil fuels, including nearly 100% in Saudi Arabia. The G20 summit details include the statement that international trade and investment are “important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development.” In many of the G20 countries, majorities of adults say that growing trade and business ties between their nations and others is a good thing. Views on the overall benefits of trade largely align across the surveyed G20 nations, though the Japanese public is less convinced of a positive effect of trade on employment. Only about two-in-ten adults in Japan (21%) believe trade creates jobs, while 40% believe trade does not have an impact on the creation of jobs. There is more certainty that trade creates jobs in the other G20 nations, with a median of 40% across 15 surveyed countries believing that trade generates jobs. However, only about two-in-ten among people in Italy and Argentina say that trade creates jobs, compared with about half who say trade destroys jobs in those countries.","G20 leaders will also focus this year on climate change , sustainable energy and plastic litter in the ocean .

The analysis also finds that when it comes to using the internet,1 the digital divide between Latinos and whites is smaller than what it had been just a few years ago. Between 2009 and 2012, the share of Latino adults who say they go online at least occasionally increased 14 percentage points, rising from 64% to 78%.2 Among whites, internet use rates also increased, but only by half as much—from 80% in 2009 to 87% in 2012. Over the same period, the gap in cellphone ownership between Latinos and other groups either diminished or disappeared. In 2012, 86% of Latinos said they owned a cellphone, up from 76% in 2009. Among the biggest drivers of these increases are spikes in technology adoption among foreign-born Latinos and Spanish-dominant Latinos, the surveys found. Both groups’ rates of going online and cellphone ownership increased sharply since 2009, helping to reduce the digital divide between Latinos and whites—and also reducing gaps within the Latino community itself. When it comes to owning a smartphone, going online from a mobile device and using social networking sites, Latinos are just as connected as other Americans. According to the Pew Research analysis: While Latinos use mobile and social networking technologies at rates similar to those of other groups, they lag whites when it comes to owning a desktop or laptop computer or accessing the internet (with or without a mobile device). According to the Pew Research analysis: Among Latinos, among whites and among blacks, three key demographic characteristics are correlated with technology adoption. Young people ages 18 to 29 have higher adoption rates than those ages 65 and older. Levels of educational attainment are also linked to adoption rates–those with some college experience have higher technology adoption rates than those with less than a high school diploma. And annual family income is correlated with technology adoption–those with higher incomes also have higher adoption rates than those with lower incomes. For example, smartphone ownership is correlated with age among Latinos and among whites.4 Among Latinos, 66% of those ages 18 to 29 say they own a smartphone while just 14% of those ages 65 and older say the same. Among whites, two-third (66%) of young people ages 18 to 29 own a smartphone while 17% of those ages 65 and older say they own one.5 This report is based on three Pew Research Center surveys. The first survey is the Pew Hispanic Center’s 2012 National Survey of Latinos (NSL). The 2012 NSL is a nationally representative bilingual telephone survey of 1,765 Latino adults with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The survey was fielded from Sept. 7 to Oct. 4, 2012. For a full description of the 2012 NSL’s survey methodology, see Appendix B. The second survey is the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press’ nationally representative Biennial Media Consumption Survey (2012b) of 3,003 adults conducted between May 9 and June 3, 2012. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence interval. The third survey is the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project 2012 Health Tracking Survey (Fox and Duggan, 2013). It is a nationally representative sample of 3,014 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence interval. Other key findings include: Going Online Going Online through a Mobile Device Cellphone Ownership Smartphone Ownership Computer Ownership Using Social Networking Sites Among native-born Latinos who use social networking sites, 86% do so mostly or only in English. By contrast, among immigrant Latinos who use social networking sites, more than half (55%) do so mostly or only in Spanish. This report explores social media, digital technology and mobile technology use among Latinos, whites and blacks in 2012. The data used in this report are derived primarily from the Pew Hispanic Center’s 2012 National Survey of Latinos (NSL), which was conducted from Sept. 7 through Oct. 4, 2012, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia among a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1,765 Latino adults. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish on cellular as well as landline telephones. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Interviews were conducted for the Pew Hispanic Center by Social Science Research Solutions (SSRS). The report also utilizes data from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press’ Biennial Media Consumption Survey (2012b), which was conducted between May 9 and June 3, 2012, among a nationally representative sample of 3,003 adults, including 2,202 whites and 281 blacks. It also utilizes data from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project’s Health Tracking Survey (Fox and Duggan, 2013), which was conducted between Aug. 7 and Sept. 6, 2012, among a nationally representative sample of 3,014 adults, including 1,864 whites and 497 blacks. This report was written by Associate Director Mark Hugo Lopez, Research Associate Ana Gonzalez-Barrera and Research Assistant Eileen Patten.

The author thanks Taylor, Keeter, Christian, Livingston, Patten, Rakesh Kochhar, Rich Morin, Seth Motel, Kim Parker and Antonio Rodriguez for guidance on the development of the survey instrument. Motel also provided research assistance. Livingston and Patten number-checked the report. Molly Rohal was the copy editor. The terms “Latino” and “Hispanic” are used interchangeably in this report. The terms “whites” and “blacks” are used to refer to the non-Hispanic components of their populations. “Native born” or “U.S. born” refers to persons born in the United States and those born in other countries to parents at least one of whom was a U.S. citizen. “Foreign born” refers to persons born outside of the United States to parents neither of whom was a U.S. citizen. Foreign born also refers to those born in Puerto Rico. Although individuals born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens by birth, they are included among the foreign born because they are born into a Spanish-dominant culture and because on many points their attitudes, views and beliefs are much closer to Hispanics born abroad than to Hispanics born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Language dominance is a composite measure based on self-described assessments of speaking and reading abilities. “Spanish-dominant” persons are more proficient in Spanish than in English, i.e., they speak and read Spanish “very well” or “pretty well” but rate their ability to speak and read English lower. “Bilingual” refers to persons who are proficient in both English and Spanish. “English-dominant” persons are more proficient in English than in Spanish.","The analysis also finds that when it comes to using the internet,1 the digital divide between Latinos and whites is smaller than what it had been just a few years ago .

This also comes at a time when President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants the U.S. to rejoin the Iran nuclear pact brokered under the Obama administration and from which President Trump withdrew two years ago. But that may be complicated by the Nov. 27 assassination of prominent Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was killed outside Tehran – for which Iranians have blamed Israel – as well as the killing of another top official, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. airstrike earlier this year. Iran is viewed negatively by people in many countries around the world. In a survey of 14 advanced economies from this summer, a median of about seven-in-ten expressed unfavorable views of Iran, while only about two-in-ten hold a favorable view. A median of roughly one-in-ten expressed no opinion. In all 14 countries surveyed, majorities had negative impressions of Iran. The Scandinavian publics polled have the most biting assessments of the Islamic Republic, with over eight-in-ten in both Sweden and Denmark expressing distaste. Spanish and Dutch opinions also are overwhelmingly critical, with about eight-in-ten in each country holding negative views of Iran. On the flip side, adults in the two East Asian countries included in the survey were the least likely to express dislike of Iran. About six-in-ten or fewer in Japan and South Korea hold Iran in low regard, shares about 10 points or more below the median. In Japan, roughly one-in-five did not weigh in on this question, nor did one-in-ten in South Korea. Iran received some of the lowest marks among the countries asked about in this year’s survey, which also included the U.S. and China. A 14-country median of 71% said they disliked Iran, making critical views of it more common than unfavorable opinions of the U.S. and about as common as negative assessments of China. In five of the 14 nations surveyed, Iran is the least popular country among those asked about, and in Germany it is tied with China for last place. In the Asia-Pacific region and Canada, assessments of China are more unfavorable than opinions of Iran by double-digit margins. In the European countries where the largest shares express negative views of China, these divides are smaller. In 11 of the nations polled, older people were more likely than younger people to give Iran poor marks. And in 10 of those countries, there are double-digit divides in views of Iran between older and younger adults. Political ideology and affiliation also influence opinions of Iran. In six of the nations surveyed, there were significant differences between those on the left and right of the ideological spectrum. In all countries where there are divides, those on the right had a more critical assessment of Iran than those on the left. In South Korea, those who lean right were 16 points more likely to dislike Iran than their counterparts on the left. Those who support different political parties also differed in their opinions of Iran. In the U.S., 82% of Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP viewed Iran negatively, compared with seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners. Despite shifts in U.S.- Iran relations since 2010, divides in assessments of Iran between parties have been largely stable over this time period. In some European countries, those who support left-wing populist parties were less critical of Iran. Supporters of Italy’s Five Star Movement (-19 percentage points), Spain’s Podemos (-9 points) and France’s France Insoumise (-8 points) are less likely than those who do not support these parties to hold negative views of Iran. Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.","Iran received some of the lowest marks among the countries asked about in this year ’s survey , which also included the U.S. and China .

Nearly four-in-ten (38%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy, up from 29% in February, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted March 3-6 among 1,006 adults. Just more than half (53%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, down from 64% in February. Relatively small numbers each month report hearing mostly good news about the economy (6% in February, 7% in March). Concern about prices –especially gas prices – appears to be a key factor in the more negative perceptions. Nine-in-ten (90%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas prices, up from an already high 77% in February. About six-in-ten (62%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about food and consumer prices in general. That’s up from 49% one month ago. On the other hand, public perceptions of news about the job situation are largely unchanged from last month, despite the March 4 release of a federal jobs report that showed significant job gains in February. Half (50%) say they have been hearing mostly bad news about the job situation, about the same as the 52% that said this in February. Those surveyed after the release of the federal unemployment report were less negative about job news than those surveyed just before its release; 47% of those surveyed March 4-6 say they are hearing mostly bad news about the jobs situation, while 55% of those contacted on March 3 – the day before the report was released – say the same. Meanwhile, perceptions of news about the overall economy did not shift significantly over the course of the survey period. News about the unrest in Libya – which has had a significant impact on oil prices – topped the public’s news interest last week; 23% say this was the news they followed more closely than any other story. Another 18% say they followed news about disputes between state governments and public employee unions most closely and 15% say they followed more general news about the economy that closely. Those same stories received the most coverage, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). In the first two months of 2011, the public saw more positive signs in economic news. In January, nearly seven-in-ten (68%) said they were hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, up from 55% in December. Now perceptions are comparable to the latter half of 2010. And those more negative perceptions cross partisan lines. More than four-in-ten Republicans (43%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy, up from 32% in February. A third of Democrats (33%) say the same, up from 23%. Among independents, 39% say they are hearing mostly bad news. That’s up from 28% one month earlier. There also were comparable drops in those saying they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy. Among Republicans, 50% now say this, down from 62% in February. Nearly six-in-ten Democrats (56%) agree, down from 69%, as well as 57% of independents, down from 67%. While more Americans now say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas and consumer prices, perceptions of news about other economic sectors have changed little since early February. For example, 46% say they are hearing mostly bad news about real estate values, not much different from the 51% that said this in February. Still, that is down sharply from the 62% that said this in December. The percent hearing a mix of good and bad news about this has been gradually increasing since December, when it stood at 28%. Currently, 36% say this. Looking at financial markets, 33% say they are hearing mostly bad news, while 47% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news. That is largely unchanged from February (31% mostly bad, 46% mix of good and bad). Perceptions of news about food and consumer prices have turned more negative since last summer. Six-in-ten (62%) now say they are hearing mostly bad news about prices, compared with 41% in December and 32% last July. Nearly half (48%) said they were hearing a mix of good and bad news about consumer prices last July. That dropped to 39% in February and now stands at 26%. The high percentages that say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas prices run across demographic and political groups. About nine-in-ten say this among Republicans (92%), Democrats (91%) and independents (89%). Nearly all of those with household incomes of $75,000 or more (96%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas prices, while nearly nine-in-ten (87%) of those with incomes of less than $30,000 say the same. The public divided its attention last week between the ongoing violence in Libya and economic concerns at home. The latter includes various state budget battles and general economic news from around the nation. News coverage last week was largely in sync with the public’s interests. More than two-in-ten Americans (23%) say they followed news about the events in Libya most closely, making this the public’s top story last week. Libya shared the top spot one week earlier with related news about the impact of Mid-East turmoil on domestic oil prices. About three-in-ten (31%) say they followed news about Libya very closely, down slightly from one week earlier (38%). Coverage of the situation in Libya accounted for 28% of the newshole, according to PEJ. Nearly two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about the disputes in Wisconsin and other states between lawmakers and public employee unions most closely. The state budget conflicts accounted for 13% of coverage. About three-in-ten (29%) say they followed news about these stories very closely, down from 36% the previous week. There is a significant age gap in attentiveness to this news. Among those 65 and older, 37% say they followed these stories very closely; few (12%) under 30 followed that closely. About half (51%) of young people did not follow this news at all closely. News about U.S. economic conditions was the most closely followed story for 15% of the public. Coverage – highlighted by news about fuel prices and new federal unemployment data – accounted for 6% of the newshole. Close to four-in-ten (37%) followed economic news very closely, comparable to the levels of interest in early January and early February of this year, but down from the 49% that said they were following this news very closely one week earlier. About one quarter (24%) say they very closely followed news about a Supreme Court decision that protects the free speech rights of protestors at military funerals. Interest was greater than in October, when 18% said they were very closely following the case about a Baptist Church that had organized anti-gay protests at the funerals of U.S. soldiers. The court’s ruling last week was the most closely followed story for 6% of the public and received 2% of coverage. The debate in Washington over the federal budget deficit was the most closely followed story for 5%. Last week, budget news centered on Congress approving a plan to temporarily avoid a government shutdown. About a quarter (26%) say they followed this news very closely. News about the budget debate accounted for 4% of coverage. More Republicans (33%) say they followed the budget debate very closely than either Democrats or independents (24% each). Reports that two U.S. airmen were shot and killed by a gunman outside the airport in Frankfurt, Germany was the most closely followed story for 3% of the public. Just 16% tracked this story very closely. This news accounted for about 1% of the newshole. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected February 28-March 6, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected March 3-6, from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults. The analysis in this report is based on telephone interviews conducted March 3-6, 2011 among a national sample of 1,006 adults 18 years of age or older living in the continental United States (674 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 332 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 144 who had no landline telephone). The survey was conducted by interviewers at Princeton Data Source under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International. A combination of landline and cell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English. Respondents in the landline sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at home. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that person was an adult 18 years of age or older. For detailed information about our survey methodology, see: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/methodology/detailed. The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, region, and population density to parameters from the March 2010 Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The sample also is weighted to match current patterns of telephone status and relative usage of landline and cell phones (for those with both), based on extrapolations from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size within the landline sample. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.","In the first two months of 2011 , the public saw more positive signs in economic news .

However, the partisan gap in sympathies, while little changed in recent years, is as large as it has been in more than three decades of polling. Discussion of the U.S.-Israeli relationship is likely to come to the fore with the nomination of former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel as President Obama’s new secretary of defense. The choice of Hagel has drawn criticism from some of his former Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill, who have questioned whether he has been supportive enough of Israel. In a Pew Research Center survey conducted last month (Dec. 5-9), 50% of adults said they sympathized more with Israel in its dispute with the Palestinians. Just 10% sympathized more with the Palestinians, while about as many (13%) volunteered that they sympathized with neither side. Attitudes toward Israel and the Palestinians have become more divided along partisan lines: In December, 70% of Republicans sympathized with more Israel, while just 2% sympathized more with the Palestinians and 7% said they sympathized with neither side. About four-in-ten Democrats (41%) sympathized more with Israel and 13% sympathized with the Palestinians. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to volunteer that they sympathized with neither side in the conflict (15% vs. 7% of Republicans) and to offer no opinion (27% vs. 18%). The 29-point partisan gap in the percentages sympathizing more with Israel is about the same as it has been in recent years. But differences were more modest a decade ago, and in 1978, shortly after the Israel-Egypt peace agreement, the gap was just five points. The differences have widened as Republican support for Israel has grown and Democratic opinion has been more stable. In December, 70% of Republicans sympathized more with Israel, compared with 56% in 2002 and 49% in 1978. Among Democrats, the most recent measure (41%) was little different from the percentage of Democrats who sympathized more with Israel in 2002 (37%) and 1978 (44%). Aside from the partisan gap in Mideast sympathies, there also are religious and age differences in these opinions. As in recent years, the December 2012 survey found that white evangelical Protestants were far more likely to sympathize more with Israel than were members of other religious groups. Fully 67% of white evangelical Protestants said they sympathized more with Israel than the Palestinians. By contrast, only about half of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics (47% each) sympathized more with Israel. Among the religiously unaffiliated, 40% said their sympathies were more with Israel than the Palestinians. Majorities of those 65 and older (58%) and those 50 to 64 (also 58%), sympathized more with Israel, compared with just 38% of those younger than 30. While there was a sizable partisan gap in Middle East sympathies, both parties were also internally divided. Three-quarters of conservative Republicans (75%) sympathized more with Israel, compared with 60% of moderate and liberal Republicans. Among Democrats, 46% of the party’s conservatives and moderates said they sympathized more with Israel, compared with 33% of liberals. Conservative Republicans also stand out for their belief that the United States has not been supportive enough of Israel. In a survey last October, fully 57% of conservative Republicans said the U.S. has not been supportive enough of Israel. Across other political groups, majorities or pluralities said U.S. support for Israel was about right. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, 46% said U.S. support for Israel was about right; just 21% viewed it as inadequate – less than half the percentage among conservative Republicans. Nearly half of white evangelical Protestants (46%) said that the United States had done too little to support Israel, by far the highest percentage of any religious group. No more than about a quarter in other religious groups said the United States was not supportive enough of Israel.

Four-in-ten Millennial workers ages 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor’s degree in 2016, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Current Population Survey data. That compares with 32% of Generation X workers and smaller shares of the Baby Boom and Silent generations when they were in the same age range. In 2016, almost half (46%) of employed Millennial women ages 25 to 29 had a bachelor’s degree or more, up substantially from 36% of Gen X women workers when they were the same age in 2000. Millennial men in the workforce are also more likely to hold a bachelor’s degree than their Gen X counterparts were as young adults. Among employed men ages 25 to 29, the share of college graduates rose from 29% in 2000 to 36% in 2016 – a considerable increase, but still smaller than that seen among young women. Consequently, the gender gap in college attainment among young workers grew to 10 percentage points in 2016. This gender gap is driven in part by the fact that young women are more likely to finish college than their male counterparts. In 2016, among 25- to 29-year-olds, women were 7 percentage points more likely than comparable men to have at least a bachelor’s degree. While education levels have increased among young workers across all major racial and ethnic groups, the large gaps that existed among Gen X workers in 2000 persist among Millennial workers today. Asian workers in the U.S. are the most likely to have completed at least a bachelor’s degree. In 2016, about two-thirds (65%) of Asian workers ages 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor’s degree, compared with 47% of white workers in this age group. And although the share of young black and Hispanic workers who are college educated has grown, just 27% of black Millennial workers and 21% of Hispanic Millennial workers held a bachelor’s degree in 2016. The Northeast region of the U.S. leads in the share of young workers who are college graduates. Half of Millennial workers ages 25 to 29 in Northeastern states had at least a bachelor’s degree in 2016, 12 percentage points higher than the share of Gen X workers in that region who had finished college in 2000 (38%). The share of young workers with a college degree in the Midwest, South and West also increased from 2000 to 2016, but to a lesser extent than in the Northeast. Young workers living in metropolitan areas are far more likely to have earned a bachelor’s degree than those in more rural communities. In 2016, 42% of young Millennial workers in metro areas held a bachelor’s degree, an increase from 34% of young Gen X workers in 2000. By contrast, just 24% of young workers in non-metro areas in 2016 had completed college, up from 20% in 2000. The increase in educational attainment among Millennials comes as the economic payoffs of a bachelor’s degree – particularly in terms of earnings – are greater now than they were in the past.","Asian workers in the U.S. are the most likely to have completed at least a bachelor ’s degree .

Just over half of all Hispanic adults in the U.S. worry that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported, a new nationwide survey of Latinos by the Pew Hispanic Center has found. Nearly two-thirds say the failure of Congress to enact an immigration reform bill has made life more difficult for all Latinos. Smaller numbers (ranging from about one-in-eight to one-in-four) say the heightened attention to immigration issues has had a specific negative effect on them personally. These effects include more difficulty finding work or housing; less likelihood of using government services or traveling abroad; and more likelihood of being asked to produce documents to prove their immigration status. However, when respondents were asked about changes in the overall situation of Latinos in this country in the past year, no consensus view emerged. About one-in-three say things have gotten worse, about one-in-four say things have gotten better, and about four-in-ten say there has been no change. Despite their concerns about the impact of the immigration debate, Hispanics are generally content with their own lives and upbeat about the long-term prospects for Latino children. Nearly eight-in-ten respondents, for example, say they are very (45%) or somewhat (33%) confident that Hispanic children growing up now will have better jobs and more money than they have. Hispanics are the nation’s largest minority group, numbering 47 million (about 15.5% of the total U.S. population). About a quarter of Hispanic adults are unauthorized immigrants, most of them arriving as part of a heavy wave of immigration that began gathering force in the 1970s.1 Twice in the past two years, the U.S. Congress tried but failed to pass comprehensive legislation to deal with the problem of illegal immigration. However, federal, state and local governments have pressed forward with hundreds of new enforcement bills, regulations and procedures—including stepped-up deportations, more workplace raids, and restrictions on access to driver’s licenses and other government services and benefits. (A summary of key trends in enforcement begins on page 6). The survey finds that Hispanics oppose these enforcement measures, often by lopsided margins. Three quarters (75%) disapprove of workplace raids; some 79% prefer that local police not take an active role in identifying illegal immigrants; and some 55% disapprove of states checking for immigration status before issuing driver’s licenses. By contrast, non-Hispanics are much more supportive of all these policies, with a slight majority favoring workplace raids and a heavy majority favoring driver’s license checks.2 In addition to this wide variance in views between Hispanics and non-Hispanics, the survey finds less pronounced—but still significant—gaps within the Hispanic community on a range of matters, from perceptions about discrimination to attitudes about illegal immigration to support for tougher enforcement measures. For example, on questions about enforcement policies, native-born Hispanics take positions that are closer to those of the rest of the U.S. population than do foreign-born Hispanics. Also, the native born are less likely than the foreign born to report a negative personal impact from the heightened attention to immigration issues. Likewise, Hispanics who are not citizens feel much more vulnerable in the current environment than do Hispanics who are citizens. They are about twice as likely as Hispanic citizens to worry about deportation and to feel a specific negative personal impact from the heightened attention to illegal immigration. (Non-citizens account for 44% of the total adult Hispanic population. Of these non-citizen Latino adults, an estimated 55% are undocumented immigrants and the other 45% are legal aliens). Hispanics also have widely varying assessments about the amount of attention that local officials and political leaders in their communities are paying to the issue of illegal immigration. A third say a lot, but four-in-ten say not too much, and one-in-five say none at all. These variances likely reflect the reality that immigration has become a politically heated local issue in some parts of the country but not in others. Whatever new vulnerability Hispanics feel in the present political and policy environment, the survey finds little evidence of a backlash against illegal immigration by Hispanics themselves. To the contrary, Hispanics generally see illegal immigrants as a plus – both for the Latino community itself and for the U.S. economy in general. Here, too, there are differences by nativity – with the foreign born significantly more positive than the native born in their views about the effects of illegal immigration. But even the native born are more positive than negative. And, as they assess the impact of illegal immigrants on the economy, native-born Latinos are more inclined to see a positive impact now (64%) than they were five years ago, when just 54% said the impact was positive. The Pew Hispanic Center survey was conducted by telephone from October 3 through November 9, 2007 among a randomly-selected, nationally-representative sample of 2,003 Hispanic adults ages 18 and over (with a margin of error of plus/minus 2.7 percentage points). A summary of its key findings: The terms “Latino” and “Hispanic” are used interchangeably in this report, as are the terms “foreign born” and “immigrant.” The terms “unauthorized immigrants”, “undocumented immigrants” and “illegal immigrants” are also used interchangeably. Native-born persons include those born in Puerto Rico. Citizens include citizens by birth and naturalization. Percents may not total 100 due to rounding or the omission of don’t know/refused responses. The 2007 National Survey of Latinos focuses on Hispanics’ views on the immigration debate and immigration enforcement, attitudes towards illegal immigrants, and perceptions of discrimination. The survey was conducted by telephone from October 3 through November 9, 2007 among a randomly-selected, nationally-representative sample of 2,003 Hispanic adults (with a margin of error of plus/minus 2.7%). Contributors to the report include April Clark, D’Vera Cohn, Richard Fry, Cary Funk, Felisa Gonzales, Rakesh Kochhar, Gretchen Livingston, Jeffrey Passel and Paul Taylor.","The survey finds that Hispanics oppose these enforcement measures , often by lopsided margins .

A smaller share of the public (38%) says abortion should be illegal in all (12%) or most cases (26%). The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted July 22-August 4 among 4,175 adults, also finds little support for overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman’s right to an abortion. Seven-in-ten say they do not want to see the Roe v. Wade decision completely overturned; 28% say they would like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn the 1973 decision. Consistent with these views, a majority of Americans say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult (59%) rather than too easy (39%) for people to be able to get an abortion. Partisan divides over abortion policy remain deep and the issue also exposes differences within the two parties, especially the GOP. Democrats broadly back access to legal abortion: About eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (82%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A somewhat larger share of liberal (91%) than conservative and moderate (75%) Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Democrats are ideologically divided over how far protections for legal abortion should extend: Conservative and moderate Democrats are more likely to say abortion should be legal in most cases (45%) than in all cases (30%). The balance of opinion is reversed among liberal Democrats: 51% say abortion should be legal in all cases, while 39% say it should be legal in most cases. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, significantly more say abortion should be illegal (62%) than legal (36%) in all or most cases. Republicans are deeply split on this question by ideology: 77% of conservative Republicans say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases; just 22% say it should be legal. By contrast, 57% of moderate and liberal Republicans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with a smaller share (41%) who say it should be illegal. When it comes to abortion policy, the public expresses somewhat more agreement with the Democratic Party’s policies than those of the Republican Party – though a sizable minority says they don’t agree with either party’s policies. Overall, 42% agree with the Democratic Party’s policies on abortion either strongly (28%) or somewhat (15%). A smaller share (32%) says they strongly (21%) or somewhat (11%) agree with the policies of the GOP. About a quarter (24%) says they don’t agree with either party on this issue. Most partisans agree with their own party’s stance on abortion policy, but moderates in both parties are especially likely to express some doubts about their own party’s policies on abortion. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 64% agree with the GOP’s stance on abortion, while 23% say they do not agree with either party and 12% say they agree with the Democratic Party’s policies. About eight-in-ten conservative Republicans (81%) agree with the GOP on abortion policy, compared with just 41% of moderate and liberal Republicans. A majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (59%) do not agree with either party (35%) or agree with the Democratic Party (24%) on abortion policy. Seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners say they agree with their own party on abortion policy; 22% say they do not agree with either party and just 7% agree with the GOP. Liberal Democrats (85%) are much more likely than conservatives and moderates (57%) to agree with the Democratic Party’s policies on abortion. Roughly a third of conservatives and moderates (32%) say they do not agree with either party’s policies; 9% say they agree with the GOP. While Republicans and Democrats have long differed in their views on abortion, the partisan gap today is larger than it has been in recent years. And the growing partisan gap has been driven largely by an increase in support for legal abortion among Democrats. In the current survey, Democrats and Democratic leaners are 46 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases (82% vs. 36%). This gap is wider than it has been in previous Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2007. For instance, in 2016, there was a 33-point gap between the shares of Democrats (72%) and Republicans (39%) who supported legal abortion in all or most cases. Differences in views on legal abortion extend beyond party affiliation; there are significant divides in views on the basis of religious affiliation, education and age. Notably, there are virtually no differences in the opinions of women and men. A majority of white mainline Protestants (60%) and black Protestants (64%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. By contrast, 77% of white evangelical Protestants say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Among Catholics, more say abortion should be legal (56%) than illegal (42%) in all or most cases. Those who are not affiliated with a religion are among the most supportive of legal abortion: 83% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Among all adults, those with higher levels of educational attainment are more supportive of legal abortion than those with less education. While 72% of those with postgraduate degrees say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a smaller majority of those who have not completed college (57%) say the same. Across age groups, those under 50 are more supportive of legal abortion than are those 50 and older. For example, 70% of those ages 18 to 29 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 55% of those ages 65 and older. Seven-in-ten say they do not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its Roe v. Wade decision, compared with 28% who want to see the decision completely overturned. Similar majorities of women (70%) and men (69%) do not want Roe v. Wade overturned. Republicans are divided in their views, reflecting internal ideological differences. Half of Republicans and Republican leaners do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade; nearly as many (48%) would like to see the decision overturned. By 61% to 37%, conservative Republicans say they would like Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Moderate and liberal Republicans take the opposite view: 70% do not want the Supreme Court to overturn the decision, while just 27% say they want this to happen. Nearly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (87%) do not want Roe v. Wade overturned, including 94% of liberal Democrats and 81% of conservative and moderate Democrats. Views on the Roe v. Wade decision are tied to overall views on whether abortion should be legal or illegal. For instance, 92% of those who say abortion should be legal in all or most cases do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. A majority of those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases (62%) want the decision overturned; however, a sizable minority (35%) of those who think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases do not want the court to completely overturn its 1973 decision. When asked whether they personally know someone who has had an abortion – such as a close friend, family member or the respondent themselves – 57% of the public says they know someone who has had an abortion; 42% say they do not. About half or more across most demographic groups say they know someone who has had an abortion. Women (63%) are 12 percentage points more likely than men (51%) to say they personally know someone who has had an abortion. Across age groups, the youngest adults ages 18 to 29 (48%) are less likely than older adults – particularly those ages 50 to 64 – to say they know someone who has had an abortion. The share who know someone who has had an abortion varies little across levels of educational attainment. Nearly identical shares of Democrats and Democratic leaners (58%) and Republicans and Republican leaners (57%) say they personally know someone who has had an abortion. Those who personally know someone who has had an abortion are only modestly more likely than those who do not to say abortion should be legal. Almost two-thirds of those who know someone who has had an abortion say abortion should be legal in all or most cases (64%). Among those who do not know someone who has had an abortion, support for legal abortion is slightly lower (57%). Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, those who know someone who has had an abortion are 7 percentage points more likely than those who don’t to support legal abortion (85% and 78%, respectively). There is only a 3-point difference among Republicans and Republicans leaners in support for legal abortion between those who know someone who has had an abortion (38%) and those who do not (35%). About six-in-ten Americans (59%) say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult for people to be able to get an abortion; 39% say their greater concern is that some states are making it too easy for people to be able to get an abortion. A majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (83%) say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult for people to get an abortion. By 65% to 33%, Republicans and Republican leaners say their greater concern is that some states are making it too easy for people to get an abortion. Views on this question are closely related to overall views on whether abortion should be legal or illegal. Almost nine-in-ten of those who say abortion should be legal in all or most cases (88%) say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult to get an abortion. Among those who think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, 83% say their greater concern is over states making it too easy for people to get an abortion. Demographic differences on this question are similar to those on whether abortion should be legal or illegal.","A majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 83 % ) say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult for people to get an abortion .

Represented among the 51.9 million Latinos in the United States are individuals who trace their heritage to more than 20 Spanish-speaking nations worldwide. But one group—Mexicans—dominates the nation’s Latino population. In 2011, nearly two-thirds (64.6%) of U.S. Hispanics, or 33.5 million, traced their family origins to Mexico, according to Pew Research Center tabulations of the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS). By comparison, Puerto Ricans, the nation’s second largest Hispanic-origin group, number about 5 million and make up 9.5% of the total Hispanic population in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.1 Following Mexicans and Puerto Ricans are Salvadorans, Cubans,2 Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Spaniards, Hondurans, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Argentineans. Together these 14 groups make up 95% of the U.S. Hispanic population.3 Among them, six Hispanic origin groups have populations greater than 1 million. Mexican-origin Hispanics have always been the largest Hispanic-origin group in the U.S. In 1860, for example, among the 155,000 Hispanics living in the U.S., 81% were of Mexican origin—a historic high. Since then the origins of the nation’s Hispanic population have diversified as growing numbers of immigrants from other Latin American nations and Puerto Rico settled in the U.S. For example, between 1930 and 1980, Hispanics from places other than Mexico nearly doubled their representation among U.S. Hispanics, from 22% to 41%. But with the arrival of large numbers of Mexican immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s, the Mexican share among Hispanics grew, rising to a recent peak of 66% in 2008. Since then it has declined slightly—to 65%—as Mexican migration to the U.S. has slowed (Passel, Cohn and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2012). The nation’s Hispanic-origin population differs in many other ways as well. For instance, U.S. Hispanics of Mexican origin have the lowest median age, at 25 years, while Hispanics of Cuban origin have the highest median age, at 40 years. Venezuelans are the most likely to have a college degree (51%) while Guatemalans and Salvadorans are among the least likely (7%). Argentineans have the highest annual median household income ($55,000) while Hondurans have the lowest ($31,000). Close to half (46%) of Hondurans and Guatemalans do not have health insurance while 15% of Puerto Ricans and Spaniards do not have health insurance. Further comparisons and rankings of the nation’s largest Hispanic-origin groups are shown in the appendix of this report. Hispanics are the nation’s largest minority group. Estimates released last week by the U.S. Census Bureau (2013) show that the Hispanic population in 2012 was 53 million, making up 17% of the U.S. population.4 By comparison, non-Hispanic blacks, who are the nation’s second largest minority group, represent 12% of the nation’s population and non-Hispanic Asians rank third at 5%.5 Hispanics are also the nation’s largest immigrant group and one of its fastest growing populations. According to the Census Bureau, Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2010 accounted for more than half of the nation’s population growth (Passel, Cohn and Lopez, 2011). Among the nation’s 40.4 million immigrants, nearly half (47%) are Hispanic (Motel and Patten, 2013). Accompanying this report are 14 statistical profiles—one for each of the 14 largest Hispanic-origin groups. Each statistical profile describes the demographic, employment and income characteristics of a Hispanic-origin population residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each origin group’s characteristics are compared with all Hispanics and the U.S. population overall.","In 2011 , nearly two - thirds ( 64.6 % ) of U.S. Hispanics , or 33.5 million , traced their family origins to Mexico , according to Pew Research Center tabulations of the 2011 American Community Survey ( ACS ) .

They believe that involvement in the global economy is good for the country and that Japan should help other nations, particularly developing ones, deal with their problems. After years of stagnating growth and start-stop economic recoveries, just three-in-ten Japanese believe economic conditions in their country are good, down 7 percentage points from last year. And roughly a third of the Japanese say Japan plays a less important role today than it did a decade ago. Nevertheless, nearly six-in-ten say international trade and investment is good for Japan because it creates new market opportunities and boosts growth. Roughly the same share of the public believes that Japan needs to assist other nations with their problems. Majorities want to increase investment in, trade with, and foreign aid to developing countries. And about half say Japan should take its allies’ concerns into account when making Japanese foreign policy. Yet Japanese embrace of the world has its limits. Despite quite negative views of China and the threat China’s emergence as a world power poses for Japan, the Japanese overwhelmingly reject a more robust military role for their country in the Asia-Pacific region. There is little support for more military spending, and the Japanese oppose using overwhelming military force to defeat terrorism. Moreover, the Japanese, like Europeans and Americans, are exclusionary in their view of national identity. For a person to be considered truly Japanese, around nine-in-ten believe that a person has to speak Japanese and share Japanese customs and traditions; nearly eight-in-ten say he or she must be born in Japan. And while a majority of the Japanese public maintains a favorable view of their longtime ally the United States, roughly half see U.S. power and influence as a major threat to Japan. An even larger share of the population (61%) sees America in decline, a harsher judgment of the U.S. than is found in China. These are among the key findings from a new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted among 1,000 respondents in Japan from April 26 to May 29, 2016. Among some of the leading nations of the world, the Japanese are the most likely to voice the view that their nation should help other countries deal with their problems: 59% of Japanese take this outward-looking stance compared with just 37% of Americans, a median of 40% across 10 EU nations and only 23% in India and 22% in China. The Japanese (58%) share with the Chinese (60%) and the Europeans (56%) a view that engagement with the global economy is good for their country. Only 44% of Americans hold that opinion. But the Japanese (24%) are far less likely than the Chinese (75%) and Indians (68%) to believe that their country has a more important role in the world today than it did 10 years ago. In this regard, Japanese sentiment is more like that shared in Europe (23%) and the U.S. (21%). Moreover, the Japanese public, less involved in the war on terror than their counterparts in other major nations surveyed, has far less faith in the use of military force to defeat terrorism. Japan has been on a long, dispiriting journey since the heady days of the late 1980s, when Japan’s economy was growing by leaps and bounds. The country has endured two and a half decades of anemic growth, averaging just 1.08% since 1990, according to the World Bank. Just 30% of the public believes the economy is in good shape; 68% believe the current economic situation is bad. The share that says things are good is down 7 percentage points from 2015. However, this gloomy perception needs to be seen in historical perspective. As recently as 2012, just 7% gave the economy a thumbs-up. Nevertheless, the Japanese are divided on the how things in general are going in the country: 47% are satisfied and 45% are dissatisfied. Satisfaction is up significantly from 34% in 2014. And, notably, contentment with the country’s direction today is higher than at any time since the Pew Research Center first asked the question in 2002. Those with more than a secondary school education (57%) are more likely to say things are going well than those with a secondary education or less (41%). Nearly four years into his second stint in office, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe draws generally positive, if somewhat muted, reviews. Roughly half the public (52%) approves of his handling of the economy, while 39% disapprove. Nearly three-quarters (74%) give a positive grade to Abe’s handling of relations with the United States. And more than half (54%) back his dealings with South Korea, while about a third (34%) disapprove. The public is less supportive of Abe’s handling of relations with China (46% approve, 40% disapprove). Men (58%) are more supportive than women (46%) of Abe’s handling of the economy. There is a 13-percentage-point difference in views between men (81%) and women (68%) about the prime minister’s handling of relations with the U.S. Japanese with more than a high school education are more supportive (53%) than those with a high school education or less (42%) of Abe’s dealings with China. And there is a similar division in views about his relations with South Korea (62% support from more highly educated Japanese, 50% from the less educated). The Japanese public sees cybersecurity, ISIS and climate change as the biggest threats to their country. About seven-in-ten Japanese (71%) say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to Japan. Roughly the same share of the public (69%) believes the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS represents a major threat. And a similar number (68%) cite global climate change as a major problem. Notably, it is older Japanese (75% of those ages 50 and older), not younger ones (59% ages 18 to 34), who are the most worried about global warming. Despite widespread antipathy toward Beijing, a smaller share of the public (63%) names China’s emergence as a world power as a major threat to Japan. And despite a largely favorable view of the United States, roughly half the Japanese public (52%) also names U.S. power and influence as a major international challenge for Japan. Young Japanese (63%), those ages 18 to 34, are more likely than those ages 50 and older (47%) to see the U.S. as a threat. Japan has the third-largest economy in the world, trailing only the United States and China. Its military does not rival that of the U.S, China and Russia, but ranks prominently among the second tier of strategic powers. And Japan is the fifth-largest exporter in the world. But the Japanese public has a mixed view of the trajectory of Japan’s role in the world. Only about a quarter (24%) believes Japan plays a more important role in the world today compared with 10 years ago. About a third (34%) says Japan plays a less important role. And 39% hold the view that Japan’s role is about as important today as it was a decade ago. (In comparison, 21% of Americans and 75% of Chinese think their country is more important.) Despite this uncertainty about their country’s place on the world stage, the Japanese are outward looking. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) say Japan should help other nations deal with their problems. This is a greater sense of public commitment to the rest of the world than in any of the other major nations surveyed in 2016. And a majority of Japanese also held such sentiment in Pew Research Center surveys conducted in both 2010 and 2011. Only about a third of the public (35%) believes that Japan should deal with its own challenges and let others deal with their own problems. Men (64%) more than women (55%) back Japan helping others, as do those with a high school education or more (64%) compared with those with a secondary education or less (56%). In one indicator of their commitment to help others, 73% of Japanese believe that Japanese companies should increase their investment in developing nations. Just 19% oppose such business activity. Roughly as many Japanese (71%) support importing more goods from developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Again, only a fifth of the public opposes such commercial help for poor nations. And 66% of Japanese back increasing foreign aid to developing countries, while 27% oppose boosting such assistance. (Currently, Japan commits 0.22% of its gross national income to foreign aid, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By comparison, the U.S. donates 0.17% and the UK 0.71%.) Notably, Japanese men (74%) are more likely than women (58%) to support increased foreign aid for developing countries.) In its conduct of foreign policy, roughly half (48%) of Japanese voice the view that Japan should take into account the interests of its allies, even if it means making compromises. Only 40% believe that Japan should follow its own national interests in international affairs, even when its allies strongly disagree. With regard to the goals of that foreign policy, roughly six-in-ten (62%) say improving human rights is important, but many other foreign policy objectives should be more important. Just 29% believe that improving human rights around the world should be one of Japan’s most important foreign policy goals. And only 3% dismiss human rights as a national foreign policy aim. More than one-third of the Japanese economy is accounted for by imports and exports of goods and services. And the Japanese public backs such global economic engagement. A majority (58%) believes that it is a good thing for Japan to be economically involved with the world because it provides the nation with new markets and opportunities for growth. Just a third (32%) say such engagement is a bad thing because it lowers wages and costs Japan jobs. Japanese with more than a high school education are more likely (67%) than those with a high school education or less (52%) to say involvement in the global economy is good for Japan. But the Japanese are under no illusion that they are the world’s leading economy. Just 6% of Japanese believe their country is the world’s economic superpower. Fully 61% say the leader is the United States, while 24% name China. The exercise of military force has been controversial in Japan since World War II. The Japanese Constitution outlaws war as a means for the state to settle international disputes. A majority (62%) of Japanese say Japan should limit its military role in the Asia-Pacific region. Just 29% voice the view that Japan should play a more active military role in regional affairs. Notably, support for a more active military role is up 6 percentage points since 2015. Among the minority of Japanese who believe Japan should take on more military responsibilities, men (36%) are more likely than women (22%) to hold this view. The Japanese public’s reluctance to endorse the use of military force can also be seen in their concern about how to defeat terrorism around the world. Nearly seven-in-ten Japanese (69%) see ISIS as a major threat. Yet roughly eight-in-ten (79%) believe that relying too much on military force will create hatred that leads to more terrorism. Only 14% back using overwhelming military force as the best way to defeat international terrorism. Japan spends roughly 1% of its economy on defense. But only 29% of the public wants to increase such outlays. About half (52%) favor keeping military spending the same. And 14% want to see the government decrease military expenditures. Among the minority of Japanese who want to increase defense spending, it is men more than women. Roughly seven-in-ten Japanese (72%) have a favorable view of the United States. Such sentiment is roughly consistent with Japanese public opinion about America going back a decade. Only in 2011, after U.S. aid in response to the tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident, did Japanese support for the U.S. briefly spike (85%). Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time ally’s trajectory on the world stage. About six-in-ten (61%) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago. Just 7% believe the U.S. plays a more important role, while 29% say Washington is as important as a decade ago. Such Japanese sentiment about a longtime ally is striking: Only 39% of the Chinese see the U.S. as less important than before. Japanese ages 50 and older (67%) are more likely than those ages 18 to 34 (51%) to believe that the United States plays a less important role on the world stage today, as do men (66%) more than women (57%) and Japanese with more than a high school education (70%) compared with those with a high school education or less (56%). Nevertheless, the Japanese retain confidence (78%) in U.S. President Barack Obama to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Japanese support for the American chief executive has been strong throughout his presidency. Seven-in-ten Japanese also express confidence in Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, much more faith in her than they had when she last ran for president in 2008 (47%). Only 9% of Japanese have confidence in Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. An overwhelming 82% express no confidence. The Japanese are not nearly as positive about China, their most powerful Asian neighbor. Roughly one-in-ten (11%) hold a favorable view of China, while 86% express an unfavorable opinion, including 42% who are very unfavorable. This was not always the case: In 2002, 55% of Japanese had a positive view of China. Current anti-Chinese sentiment is also reflected in the fact that just 12% have confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping. Such negative views of China and its leader may be one manifestation of Japanese fears of a military confrontation with China. Eight-in-ten Japanese believe that territorial disputes between China and its neighbors could lead to a military conflict. Nevertheless, the Japanese are divided on how best to deal with their superpower neighbor. In thinking about relations with China, 47% say having a strong economic relationship is the most important thing to do, while 45% believe the best way forward is to be tough on territorial disputes between Japan and China. Japanese views of South Korea are little better: Just 27% voice a favorable view, down from 56% in 2006. Today, 68% of Japanese hold an unfavorable opinion of South Korea, including one-in-four who have a very unfavorable view. Japanese have long held a much higher opinion of India. More than half (54%) have a favorable view of the South Asian nation. Notably, around one-in-five Japanese voice no opinion about India. At least half of Japanese have been positively disposed toward India for the last decade, but the current approval is down from its peak of 70% in 2012. Japan is not a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a consequence of having been on the losing side in World War II. But the Abe government aspires to such a seat. At the same time, Japanese public support for the United Nations is down after peaking in 2011. Just 45% of Japanese hold a favorable view of the UN today; in 2011, 61% viewed the UN favorably. Younger Japanese (55%) have a more positive opinion of the UN than older Japanese (44%).","Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long - time ally ’s trajectory on the world stage .

In recent years, the OPT program has surpassed the H-1B visa program as the nation’s largest source of new temporary high-skilled immigrant workers. In 2017, a record 276,500 foreign graduates received work permits under the OPT program, up from 257,100 in 2016, according to data obtained from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a public records request. However, growth has slowed considerably: The number of enrollees grew by 8% in 2017, compared with 34% in 2016. That’s the largest decline in the annual growth rate since 2004, the first year for which data on all foreign students are available. The slowed growth also follows a longer period of rapid expansion for the program. From 2014 to 2016, the number of enrollees nearly doubled in size, growing by 93%. Declining growth of the OPT program is due in part to a smaller increase last year in the program’s foreign graduates who majored in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2017, enrollment of STEM graduates in OPT grew by 13% over the previous year, compared with 48% annual growth in 2016. This slowdown happened despite the maximum length of employment increasing from 12 to 36 months in 2016 for foreign graduates with STEM degrees. (By contrast, an extension for STEM degree holders in 2008 did contribute to a large increase in OPT approvals.) The decline in 2017 also coincided with low unemployment rates for U.S. workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher. The Trump administration has tightened regulations that govern the OPT program. Under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rules posted online in January, foreign graduates working under OPT must now work at the employer’s place of business. (Previously, foreign workers could work at a third-party site, such as at a client’s office.) In addition, the administration has announced plans to roll back the 2016 employment extension for STEM graduates, though this change had not been implemented as of July 2018. OPT enrollment growth slowed substantially in 2017 among foreign students from India and China, the program’s two largest countries of origin. In fact, only France, Nepal and Nigeria saw their annual growth rates increase in 2017 (among nations with 10,000 or more foreign students enrolled in OPT from 2004 to 2017). Growth in the number of foreign graduates under OPT slowed in 2017 across all degree levels, but the trend was most pronounced among master’s degree holders. About 188,600 foreign students held master’s degrees in 2017, a 9% increase over the previous year – far lower than the 45% annual increase seen in 2016. This slowdown follows a period of rapid growth: From 2014 to 2015, the number of foreign students with master’s degrees jumped by 57%, the highest annual increase of any degree level since 2004. Note: The full methodology for this analysis can be found here. Also, see where foreign student graduates worked in the U.S. between 2004 and 2016 in our interactive.","Growth in the number of foreign graduates under OPT slowed in 2017 across all degree levels , but the trend was most pronounced among master ’s degree holders .

Just 8% say Trump’s election has led to better race relations, while 30% say it has not made a difference. Shortly after Trump’s victory last year, voters had less negative expectations for how his election would affect race relations. In November 2016, nearly half (46%) said it would lead to worse race relations, while 25% expected his election to lead to improved race relations (another 26% expected little change). In 2008, voters were more optimistic about how Barack Obama’s election would affect race relations than they were after Trump’s victory. In November 2008, 52% said Obama’s election would lead to better race relations in the country. A year later, fewer Americans (36%) said race relations had improved, but just 13% said Obama’s election had made race relations worse. That was little changed from November 2008, when 9% of voters said Obama’s election would lead to worse race relations. The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 4 among 1,503 adults, finds that the public has negative assessments of the overall state of race relations in the U.S. A majority (56%) says race relations are generally bad, while 38% say they are generally good. Since May 2016, there has been an increase in the share of Americans who say race relations are getting worse – from 38% then to 44% today. Over the same period, the share saying that too little attention is paid to race and racial issues also has risen. Today, 44% say too little attention is paid to racial issues, while 32% say there is too much focus on race; 19% say about the right amount of attention is paid to racial issues. In May 2016, the public was divided over whether racial issues had received too much (36%) or too little (35%) attention; about a quarter (26%) said they had received about the right amount of attention. The survey finds that a majority of Americans (65%) continue to say there are “very strong” or “strong” conflicts between blacks and whites in the U.S. However, far more (86%) say there are strong conflicts between Republicans and Democrats than say the same about conflicts between blacks and whites, young people and older adults, rich and poor people, and between those who live in rural and urban areas. (For a detailed look at these different conflicts, see “Far more Americans say there are strong conflicts between partisans than between other groups in society.”) Opinions about the overall state of race relations have grown more negative in recent years. Positive views reached a high shortly after Obama’s inauguration in 2009, when 66% said race relations were generally good. However, public views of race relations declined significantly in 2014 and 2015, following a number of high-profile shootings of unarmed black men. In August 2014, about as many said race relations were generally good (47%) as generally bad (44%). And by May 2015, views had grown even more negative: 61% called race relations generally bad, compared with just 34% who said they were generally good. A year later, in a major survey of the public’s attitudes about race and racial inequality, opinions about the state of race relations were divided (48% generally bad, 44% generally good). Today, a 56% majority expresses a negative view of race relations, while 38% say relations are generally good. As in the past, whites have a more positive view of race relations than do blacks or Hispanics. Currently, 40% of whites say race relations are generally good, compared with 28% of blacks and 33% of Hispanics who say this. The racial gap in views of race relations was similar a year ago: At that time, 46% of whites said race relations were good, as did 34% of blacks and 37% of Hispanics. Over the past year, there also has been a rise in the share of Americans who say race relations are “getting worse.” In this case, however, blacks’ views have changed more than the views of whites. Overall, more Americans now say race relations in the U.S. are getting worse (44%) than say they are staying about the same (37%); just 17% say they are getting better. By contrast, in May 2016, about as many thought relations were getting worse (38%) as said they were holding steady (41%); 19% said they were getting better. Among blacks, about half (51%) now say race relations are getting worse, up 14 percentage points since last year. Opinion among whites remains divided: While 41% think relations are getting worse, about as many (37%) say they are staying the same; 20% think race relations are getting better. There also have been partisan shifts in opinions about the trajectory of race relations. Nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (49%) say race relations are getting worse, compared with 32% in May 2016. Republicans and Republican leaners are now somewhat less likely to say race relations are getting worse (45% then, 38% today). Even so, about as many Republicans currently say race relations are getting worse (38%) as say they are staying the same (39%). Just 20% of Republicans say race relations are getting better, about the same share who said this in May 2016 (16%). This pattern holds for white Democrats and Republicans. Among white Democrats and Democratic leaners, 46% say relations are getting worse, up 15 percentage points from 2016 (31%) Fewer today say race relations are getting better than said this last year (15% now vs. 27% then). Among white Republicans and Republican leaners, about as many say relations are worsening (39%) as say they are staying the same (38%); 21% say they are improving, up seven percentage-points from 2016. Overall, 60% of Americans say Trump’s election has led to worse race relations in the U.S. In November 2016, in a callback survey of registered voters who said they voted in the election, 46% said they thought Trump’s election would lead to worse race relations. Most of the increase in negative opinions has come among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Today, 25% say Trump has made race relations worse, while 17% say he has made them better and 53% say he has not made a difference. In November, just 10% of Republican voters expected Trump’s election to make race relations worse, while nearly half (48%) expected his election to lead to improved race relations; 38% anticipated little change as a result of his victory. By contrast, there has been little change among Democrats and Democratic leaners. Shortly after the election, 81% of Democrats said Trump’s election would lead to worse race relations; today, 83% say his election has led to worse race relations. Views of Obama’s impact on race relations also grew less positive after he became president. In his case, the shift occurred across party lines. Before the election, 70% of Democratic voters said his election would lead to better race relations. About a year later, 52% of Democrats said his election had led to better race relations. There also was a decline among Republicans (from 33% before the election to 21% the following year). Nearly two-thirds of the public says there are either very strong (27%) or strong conflicts 38%) between blacks and whites in America today. About a quarter (26%) say there are “not very strong conflicts,” and just 4% say there are “not conflicts.” An even higher percentage (86%) says there are strong conflicts between Republicans and Democrats, including 64% who say these conflicts are very strong. Six-in-ten say there are strong or very strong conflicts between the rich and poor. Fewer describe conflicts between people who live in cities and those who live in rural areas, or between young people and older people as strong (37% and 35%, respectively). Views on group conflict in America are little changed from 2016. For instance, a year ago 85% said there were at least strong conflicts between Republicans and Democrats and 66% said this about blacks and whites. Most demographic and political groups see strong or very strong conflicts between whites and blacks, but there are significant differences across groups in how widely this view is held. More blacks than whites see at least strong conflicts between their two groups (76% vs. 61%), including close to twice as many who say they are very strong (38% vs. 21%). Nearly seven-in-ten Hispanics (69%) also see strong conflicts, including 42% who say they are very strong. About three-quarters (74%) of Democrats and Democratic leaners say conflicts between blacks and whites are strong or very strong. A smaller majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (54%) say the same. The partisan gap on conflicts holds among whites: White Democrats (70%) are more likely than white Republicans (54%) to say there are at least strong conflicts between blacks and whites in America today. And while at least 70% of Democrats across racial groups say there are strong conflicts between the two racial groups, there are differences by race in views of intensity: A greater share black Democrats (38%) than white Democrats (23%) say there are very strong conflicts between whites and blacks. An increasing share of the public thinks too little attention is paid to race and racial issues in the country today: 44% say this now, while 32% say race and racial issues receive too much attention and 19% think the amount of attention is about right. In May 2016, a smaller share (35%) said too little attention was being paid to race in the country. There are stark differences across demographic, partisan and ideological groups in attitudes about the level of attention on racial issues; still, across most groups, the share saying there is too little attention has grown since 2016. Whites are divided in their views of the level of attention paid to race and racial issues: While 36% think there is too much, about as many (38%) say there is too little. By contrast, fully 68% of blacks say there is too little attention paid to race today; just 15% say there is too much. A 55% majority of Hispanics also say there is too little attention on race. Young adults are more likely than older adults to think there’s too little attention paid to race and racial issues in the country: About half of those under 30 (53%) say this, compared with four-in-ten among those ages 65 and older. The partisan gap on attention to racial issues in the U.S. is wide: By about three-to-one, more Republicans than Democrats say there is too much attention paid to racial issues (53% vs. 18%). While conservative Republicans are somewhat more likely to say this than are moderate and liberal Republicans, pluralities across all ideological groups think too much attention is paid. By contrast, a 60% majority of Democrats think there is too little attention, including fully 70% of liberal Democrats. There are modest differences in views by levels of educational attainment: 50% of college graduates say there is too little attention to racial issues, compared with 42% of those with less education. The gap across education levels is wider among whites, and this gap has grown since 2016. A plurality of whites with a college degree (46%) say there is too little attention on race today, up 16 percentage points from 2016 (30%). By contrast, about a third of whites without a college degree (34%) think there is too little attention paid to race today; a quarter (25%) said the same last year.","Nearly a year into Donald Trump ’s presidency , a majority of Americans ( 60 % ) say his election has led to worse race relations in the United States .

The answer given by those who have graduated from college is that their feelings of personal satisfaction and economic well-being are about the same, no matter which type of institution they attended, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey. Majorities of each group were satisfied with their family life, financial situation and current job. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of those three measures on overall satisfaction, though private school graduates were somewhat more likely than public school graduates to say they were “very satisfied” with their personal financial situation (44% vs. 34%). A survey conducted by Gallup and Purdue University earlier this year, coming at the question a somewhat different way, found that the type of institution the student attended—public or private, selective or less selective—mattered less to their workplace engagement and well-being later in life than the experiences they had while they were in school, such as having an encouraging mentor or participating in an internship or work experience related to classroom learning. In the Pew Research survey, both private and public college graduates were likely to say that their education was worth what they and their family paid for it. Roughly equal shares of 83% among private school graduates and 86% among public school graduates said they had already seen a payoff. Small shares of each (5% of private graduates and 7% of public graduates) said they expect to see their educations pay off in the future. The remainder said it will not pay off, or they are not sure. Graduates from private colleges were somewhat more likely to say their education was useful in preparing them for a job or career than graduates from public colleges (61% of private college graduates said it was very useful, compared with 51% of public graduates). Yet they said it took them about equal lengths of time to find the type of job they wanted after graduating. Slightly less than half of both groups (42% of private school graduates and 46% of public school graduates) said they found a job while still in school or almost immediately after graduation. The Pew Research survey found that graduates from private colleges were more likely to say they took out loans to finance their education than public college graduates (56% vs. 47%). A recent analysis of Department of Education data from the New America Foundation finds the same pattern among recent college graduates. Among adults who completed a bachelor’s degree at a private, non-profit school in the 2011-2012 school year, 74% took out loans to pay for college. The share who borrowed was even higher among graduates of private, for-profit colleges (87%). By comparison, only 64% of public college graduates took out student loans. Bachelor’s degree recipients from private schools graduated with higher average debt than those with four-year degrees from public schools. A typical private non-profit college graduate in 2011-2012 who borrowed to complete their education graduated with $32,308 in loans (those graduating from private for-profit colleges owed even more, at about $40,038), compared with $25,640 among public university graduates the same year.","Bachelor ’s degree recipients from private schools graduated with higher average debt than those with four - year degrees from public schools .

Meanwhile, the overall U.S. population increased by only 12% from 2000 to 2012. Hispanic population growth accounted for more than half of the country’s growth in this time period. Much of the growth is occurring in a relatively small geographic area. A Pew Research Center analysis last year found that the 10 largest counties by Hispanic population accounted for 22% of the national Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2011. Half of these counties are located in California. Nationally, Mexicans are the largest Hispanic origin group but the composition of origin groups varies by geographic area. For example, while Mexicans represent a majority of Hispanics in all but 11 states, Puerto Ricans are the largest group in New York and New Jersey and Cubans are most populous in Florida. The demographics of each origin group vary significantly. For example, Hispanics of Mexican origin are the youngest out of the 14 largest origin groups, with a median age of 25, compared with Cubans’  median age of 40. Venezuelans are the most likely to have a college degree (51%), compared with 7% of both Guatemalans and Salvadorans.","The Hispanic population grew to 53 million in 2012 , a 50 % increase since 2000 and nearly six times the population in 1970 , according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data .

This report examines the latest research from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project regarding seven key appliances of the information age: These findings are based on a survey of 3,001 American adults (ages 18 and older) conducted between August 9 and September 13, 2010. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish, and the survey included 1,000 cell phone interviews. When it comes to personal communication devices, the cell phone remains the “gadget of choice” among Americans in 2010—fully 85% of all adults (and three-quarters of teens) now own a mobile phone. Computers are the second-most commonly owned piece of personal technology, as six in ten Americans own a desktop computer and half own a laptop. Just under half of all adults own an mp3 player (47%) or console gaming device (42%), while e-book readers and tablet computers are currently each owned by around one in twenty adults. Eight in ten American adults (78%) own two or more of these devices, and the median adult owns three of the seven gadgets we asked about in our survey. Among other factors, device ownership is highly correlated with age. For example, the typical adult under the age of 45 owns four devices, while the typical adult between the ages of 55 and 64 owns two and the typical senior (65 or older) owns just one. Those with high levels of income and education are also more likely to own a relatively large number of devices compared to those with lower income and education levels. As the internet has increasingly gone mobile, laptop computers have grown in popularity. Since 2006, the proportion of Americans who own a desktop computer has fallen slightly from 68% to 59%, while the proportion with a laptop computer has increased dramatically—from 30% in April 2006 to 52% in September 2010. 18-29 year olds are currently the only major demographic group for whom laptops are notably more commonplace than desktop computers. Nearly three-quarters of 18-29 year olds (72%) own a laptop computer, compared with 56% who have a desktop computer. Overall, computer ownership is most prevalent within higher-income households, as more than nine in ten households with an annual income of $50,000 or more contain a computer of some kind. Interestingly, rural residents are just as likely as non-rural residents to own a desktop computer (56% of rural residents and 61% of non-rural residents do so) but are significantly less likely than non-rural dwellers to own a laptop computer (39% vs. 55%). Cell phone ownership has become near-ubiquitous in recent years, as 85% of all adults—and a majority of adults within each major demographic cohort—now own a mobile phone of some kind. Cell phone ownership is especially prominent among young adults, as 96% of 18-29 year olds now own a mobile phone. Yet even among seniors ages 65 and older—a group not traditionally known for its high levels of technology use—nearly six in ten (58%) now own a mobile phone. Put another way, cell phones are as prevalent among seniors as game consoles or desktop computers are among 18-29 year olds. Indeed, seniors are roughly 50% more likely to own a cell phone than to use the internet (40% of seniors are internet users). Just under half of American adults have an iPod or other mp3 player, a figure that has quadrupled since early 2005 (at that time 11% of Americans owned this type of device). As with cell phones, young adults are especially likely to own an mp3 player—75% of 18-29 year olds do so. Game console ownership is highly correlated with age and parental status. While six in ten adults between the ages of 18 and 49 own a gaming device, this drops to one-quarter for 50-64 year olds and just 6% for those ages 65 and older. Similarly, adults with children living at home are nearly twice as likely as non-parents to own a game console (64% of parents do so, compared with 33% of non-parents). At the moment, ownership of e-book readers and tablet computers is concentrated among college graduates and those with relatively high household incomes. Around one in ten Americans with annual household incomes of $75,000 or more own a tablet PC or e-book reader, while fewer than 5% of households earning less than $50,000 per year contain one of these devices.","These findings are based on a survey of 3,001 American adults ( ages 18 and older ) conducted between August 9 and September 13 , 2010 .

About two-thirds of the Indian public is satisfied with the direction of the country and eight-in-ten think the economy is doing well. A similarly large proportion has a favorable view of Modi, a sentiment that is down slightly from 2015. Indians are positive about Modi’s handling of various challenges facing the nation, though there is a growing partisan divide over the prime minister’s record on various domestic issues. In addition to expressing positive views of their country, Indians believe it plays a growing role on the world stage. Roughly half are supportive of India’s burgeoning international economic engagement and are committed to their allies. At the same time, the public is wary of China and longtime rival Pakistan. They favor a militaristic stance against terrorism and support increased defense spending. But only about a quarter want their country to help other nations deal with their problems. These are among the main findings of a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 2,464 respondents in India from April 7 to May 24, 2016. The Indian public’s satisfaction with the direction of the country has increased 36 percentage points since 2013, the year before Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power. Views on the economy have improved by 23 points. And belief that today’s children will be better off financially than their parents is up 8 points. A strong majority (81%) of Indians hold a favorable view of Modi, including 57% who have a very favorable opinion of him. A similar proportion of the public (80%) expresses a positive view of the BJP. Modi and the BJP enjoy overwhelming support among men and women, from people of all ages, educational backgrounds and income levels, and among people in rural and urban areas. Even a majority of backers of the rival Indian National Congress party (INC) express a positive view of Modi and the BJP. About half or more of the public approves of Modi’s handling of a range of domestic problems facing the country: helping the poor and dealing with unemployment (both 62%), handling terrorism (61%) and dealing with corruption (59%). And roughly half or more of Indians in the survey approve of Modi’s leadership style: 56% believe he cares about people like them, 51% say he stands up for what he believes and 49% say he brings people together and gets things done. Views of Modi’s performance are increasingly partisan as the divide grows between how BJP supporters and Indian National Congress adherents judge his achievements. When it comes to views of his leadership, roughly six-in-ten Indians who identify with the BJP see Modi as a unifying figure who stands up for what he believes and gets things done. Only about four-in-ten Congress adherents agree. Majorities of those who identify with the BJP approve of Modi’s handling of various domestic issues. Less than half of Congress supporters share that view. BJP support of the prime minister’s actions has improved slightly in the past year. But Congress approval has fallen sharply. This has opened up double-digit partisan gaps on Modi’s handling of various problems: 35 percentage points on his handling of corruption, 28 points on unemployment, 27 points on his help for the poor. Two-thirds of the public sees the Indian National Congress party in a favorable light and accords two of the leaders of that party – Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi – similarly strong favorable ratings. Notably, roughly half of BJP supporters voice a favorable view of the Gandhis (both 52%) and a majority has a favorable view of Congress (56%). Roughly half of the public sees the Aam Aadmi Party (47%) and Arvind Kejriwal, the party’s national convenor (50%), favorably. By more than four-to-one (68% to 15%) Indians believe their country plays a more important rather than a less significant role in the world today than it did a decade ago. And by roughly two-to-one (52% to 25%) Indians voice the view that their involvement in the global economy is a good thing because it provides India with new markets and opportunities for growth. Indians also favor toughness in dealing with the world. A majority (62%) believes that using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world. Few (21%) worry that relying too much on such force creates hatred that leads to more terrorism. And 63% back increased defense spending. Nevertheless, Indians give priority to issues at home. By more than two-to-one (53% to 23%) they believe that India should deal with its own problems and let other nations deal with theirs. This public preference for a focus on domestic issues reflects ongoing concerns about a range of issues: Roughly eight-in-ten Indians believe crime, corrupt officials, a lack of employment opportunities and terrorism are very big national problems. Indians have little love for China. Only about a third (31%) of the public expresses a favorable opinion of their emerging Asian rival. These positive views are down 10 percentage points in the past year, but unchanged from 2014. Another 36% voice an unfavorable opinion and 32% have no opinion. Large majorities say Beijing poses serious challenges for India. Seven-in-ten of those surveyed believe that China’s economic impact on India is a serious problem, including 45% who voice the view that it is very serious. Nearly half (48%) of Indians think China’s relationship with Pakistan poses a very serious problem for India. Another 21% see this as a somewhat serious challenge. Fully 69% hold the view that China’s growing military power is a problem for India, including 46% who say this is a very serious issue. And the same proportion (69%) expresses the opinion that China’s territorial disputes with India are very or somewhat serious. Notably, with regard to problems posed by China, BJP adherents are more intensely worried than Congress backers. Indians are much more likely than Americans and Europeans to express no opinion about international threats. When it comes to their country’s role in the world, Indians, Americans and Europeans have some sharply differing perspectives. (For more on how Americans and Europeans see their place in the world, see “Public Uncertain, Divided Over America’s Place in the World” released May 5, 2016, and “Europeans Face the World Divided” released June 13, 2016.) Indians are far more likely than Americans and Europeans to see their nation’s star on the rise. Roughly two-thirds of the Indian public believes that India plays a more important role in the world today than it did 10 years ago. Only about a fifth of Americans and Europeans (a median of findings from a survey of 10 EU members in spring 2016) hold this view of their respective countries. Only the Germans (62%), among the trans-Atlantic nations surveyed, have a comparable sense of their country’s recent ascendancy. At the same time, Indians (23%) are less willing than Americans (37%) or Europeans (40%) to help other nations deal with their problems. Roughly six-in-ten Indians say the use of overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world. Less than half of Americans and Europeans agree. And about six-in-ten Indians back increased military spending. Only about a third of Americans and Europeans are willing to boost current defense budgets. Indians (49%) and Americans (51%) are more in accord about the value of working with allies, even if it means making compromises. Europeans (44%) are slightly less committed to such cooperation. And Indians generally share with Europeans a faith that global economic integration is good for their country. Americans (44%) are less certain.","Large majorities say Beijing poses serious challenges for India .

Here are five facts about how 18- to 29-year-olds view the coverage and messaging around several dominant stories – particularly the demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd in police custody and the coronavirus pandemic. 1Younger adults don’t follow election and pandemic news as closely as older ones, but that gap vanishes with the George Floyd demonstrations. Only about one-third of Americans ages 18 to 29 (35%) are following news about the 2020 presidential candidates very or fairly closely, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted June 4-10 as part of the American News Pathways project. That compares with 46% of those ages 30 to 49, 60% of those ages 50 to 64 and 74% of those 65 and older. There is a similar pattern with the coronavirus pandemic. While 75% of 18- to 29-year-olds follow that news very or fairly closely, that is less than the three older groups, where that number ranges from 83% to 94%. That gap closes when it comes to coverage of the protests following the police killing of George Floyd. About eight-in-ten of the youngest adults (83%) follow that news very or fairly closely – roughly on par with every other age group except those 65 and older (90%). In one respect, those ages 18 to 29 are more engaged than other age groups. Nearly half (46%) say they discuss the demonstrations with others almost all or most of the time – 10 percentage points higher than any other age group. 2Younger adults are most likely to say the coronavirus outbreak has been made a smaller deal than it really is. By nearly a 2-to-1 margin, Americans say the coronavirus pandemic has been exaggerated into a bigger deal than it really is (38%) rather than downplayed into a smaller deal than it really is (21%). Another 40% say the outbreak has been approached about right. About a third of 18- to 29-year-olds (35%) say the pandemic has been made a bigger deal than it really is, close to the overall average. But those youngest adults are more likely to say it has been made a smaller deal (32%) than any other age group. At the same time, fewer 18- to 29-year-olds say the outbreak has been approached about right (32%) than any other age group. 3Americans ages 18 to 29 offer the most critical evaluation of Donald Trump regarding the George Floyd demonstrations and coronavirus outbreak. While six-in-ten U.S. adults say Trump has been delivering a mostly or completely wrong message in response to the Floyd demonstrations, that number rises to 76% among 18- to 29-year-olds. The next harshest critics are those ages 30 to 49, at 63%, with that number falling to 53% among those ages 50 to 64 and to 49% among those 65 and older. About three-quarters of adults ages 18 to 29 (77%) also say Trump and his administration get their facts right about the coronavirus pandemic only some of the time or hardly ever. That number drops to 68%, 61% and 56%, respectively, among the three older groups. The youngest adults are also less likely than other age groups, especially those over age 50, to closely follow what Trump has been saying in regard to these two news stories, with around half very or fairly closely following his statements relating to the Floyd demonstrations (50%) and the coronavirus outbreak (52%). Among those 50 and older, the shares who very or fairly closely follow what Trump has been saying on the Floyd demonstrations range from 65% among ages 50 to 64 to 79% among adults 65 and older. On the president’s statements about COVID-19, those numbers are 78% and 84%, respectively. Those ages 30 to 49 fall in the middle on these topics. 4Adults under age 30 offer the most critical evaluation of the media regarding the George Floyd demonstrations and coronavirus outbreak. As with Trump’s messaging, the news media fare worst among those ages 18 to 29. Fewer than half of those adults (43%) say news organizations have done very or somewhat well in covering the George Floyd protests. The next lowest grade comes from those ages 30 to 49, at 56%. The public’s assessment of media coverage of the pandemic is more positive across the board, with 71% of all adults saying journalists have done very or somewhat well. But that percentage is lowest among 18- to 29-year-olds, at 63%. In addition, a solid majority of those 18 to 29 (61%) say the media in general only sometimes or hardly ever get their facts right about the coronavirus outbreak. For the other three age groups, that percentage ranges from 52% to 45%. One source for COVID-19 information that 18- to 29-year-olds find about as credible as the other age groups is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health organizations. Two-thirds (67%) of those younger adults say those organizations get their facts right almost all or most of the time, compared with 61% of those ages 30 to 49, 64% of those 50 to 64 and 67% of those 65 and older. 5Democrats ages 18 to 29 differ from other Democrats in views of the media, while Republicans under 30 differ from other Republicans on Trump. Democrats overall tend to express more favorable views of the media than Republicans, but the youngest Democrats have a considerably less favorable view than other age groups in the party. Large majorities of Democrats in older age groups – from 69% among 30- to 49-year-olds to 92% of those 65 and older – say journalists have done an excellent or good job covering the George Floyd protests. Among those ages 18 to 29, 46% agree with that assessment. With COVID-19 coverage, the percentage of Democrats in the older age groups who say the news media have done very or somewhat well ranges between 82% and 94%. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, it is 68%. And only 9% of the youngest Democrats say the media have done very well covering COVID-19. That is a small fraction of the Democrats between 50 and 64 (53%) and those 65 and older (61%) who say the media have done very well. On the Republican side, large majorities of those in the three older age groups — ranging from 70% to 83% – say Trump’s message on the Floyd protests has been completely or mostly right. But only about half of those between 18 and 29 (49%) give the president those high marks for messaging. In regard to the coronavirus outbreak, about one-third (31%) of Republicans ages 18 to 29 say Trump and his administration get their facts right almost all or most of the time. That is, by a substantial margin, the lowest percentage of any Republican age group and roughly half as many as among Republicans age 65 and older (69%) who say the same.

Our poll last November found that half of Americans (52%) said the U.S. should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own, a view held by only 30% in 2002. But since then, there have been a host of new foreign crises that have further shaped public opinion about the threats facing the U.S. and what role the nation should play in the world. Here are some key indicators of how Americans view U.S. standing in a time of turmoil abroad: 11 The American public is still wary about the U.S. getting too involved in military action. The public’s reluctance about U.S. engagement in foreign conflicts was evident in earlier surveys during the uprising against former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 and the lack of support for U.S. intervention in the civil war in Syria in 2012. Our August survey found that the public backed President Obama’s decision to launch air strikes against the militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by a 54% to 31% margin, but the sense of caution about new U.S. involvement was still there. About half (51%) of Americans expressed concern that the U.S. would go too far in getting involved militarily in the conflict with ISIS. 22While wary about U.S. global involvement, there has been a shift in Americans’ views since Russia’s challenge to the pro-Western government in Ukraine, and the rapid rise of ISIS in the conflict-ridden Middle East. Today, 39% of Americans say the U.S. is doing too much to solve world problems, a drop from the 51% who said the same last November. Those saying that the U.S. does too little to address global problems has nearly doubled, from 17% to 31%. 33ISIS is now on the American public’s radar as a top threat. Islamic extremist groups like al Qaeda have been at the top of the list for years in our surveys of what the public sees as major global threats to the U.S. About seven-in-ten (71%) Americans held that view in our latest poll, while 67% of Americans say that a major threat is ISIS, which a year ago was not even on the radar. The only other threats that have ranked as high as these two since 2009, at different points in time, have been North Korea’s nuclear program, Iran’s nuclear program, cyber attacks from other countries and the Taliban’s growing strength in Afghanistan. 44After months of confrontation with Russia over its actions in Ukraine, the share of Americans who view the Kremlin with concern has risen, but only modestly. About a quarter (26%) saw Russia as an adversary and another 49% as a serious problem, but not as an adversary, in a July survey. Those figures were little changed from our March poll, after Russia annexed Crimea. A survey in April again illustrated the public’s caution on involvement: 53% favored the use of increased economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia, but 62% opposed sending arms or military supplies to the Ukrainian government. 55More than half (54%) of Americans now see Obama as not tough enough on foreign affairs and national security, according to our August poll. Far more Republicans (77%) hold that view than independents (56%) or Democrats (34%). Aside from its assessment of the president, the public thinks the U.S. wields less influence as a world leader than in the past. Nearly half (48%) of Americans say the U.S. is less important and powerful as a world leader than a decade ago, while 34% believe it remains as important.","While wary about U.S. global involvement , there has been a shift in Americans ’ views since Russia ’s challenge to the pro - Western government in Ukraine , and the rapid rise of ISIS in the conflict - ridden Middle East .

Most Americans favor one of its key objectives, but the bill itself draws a mostly negative reaction from those who have heard about it. Just a third of those who have heard something about the bill favor it, while 41% are opposed, and a relatively large minority (26%) offers no opinion. Yet one of the bill’s primary goals – to provide a way for people who are in this country illegally to gain legal citizenship under certain conditions – wins broad and bipartisan support. Overall, 63% of the public – and nearly identical numbers of Republicans, Democrats and independents – favor such an approach if illegal immigrants “pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs.” The debate over immigration has focused in part on whether the bill currently before Congress amounts to a grant of amnesty for people who are in the U.S. illegally. In general, the public is less supportive of providing “amnesty” for illegal immigrants than it is of providing a way for illegal immigrants to gain citizenship. Even so, a majority of Americans (54%) say they favor amnesty for illegal immigrants already in the country if they pass background checks and meet other conditions. The way in which the issue is characterized has a significant effect on Republican views. While 62% of Republicans favor “providing a way for illegal immigrants currently in the country to gain legal citizenship,” support declines sharply when the concept of amnesty is raised. However, even when the policy is described as “providing amnesty” for illegal immigrants, about as many Republicans favor (47%) as oppose (48%) the idea. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted May 30-June 3 among 1,503 adults, finds a growing majority of Americans saying increased employer sanctions, as opposed to more border fences and patrols, can best reduce illegal immigration from Mexico. A 55% majority sees increased penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants as the most effective way to stem cross-border immigration, up from 49% a year ago. By comparison, just 25% say increasing the number of border patrol agents is the best solution, and even fewer (7%) see more border fences as the most effective solution. The survey finds that Americans are less impressed now by the Democratic congressional leadership than when the party took control of Congress in January. While approval of the job Democratic leaders are doing has dipped only slightly – from 39% in January to 34% today – disapproval has grown substantially from 34% to 49%. Independents, in particular, express a much more negative opinion of Democratic congressional leaders. Fully 58% disapprove of their job performance, up from 40% in January. Among Democrats, disapproval of Democratic leaders has approximately doubled since January (from 13% to 27%). Still, a solid majority of Democrats (58%) approve of the job the party’s congressional leaders are doing. Democratic leaders in Congress also are facing criticism from both the right and the left for their handling of Iraq policy. Liberal Democrats are increasingly of the view that Democratic congressional leaders have not gone far enough in challenging President Bush’s Iraq policies, while most Republicans say they have gone too far in confronting the president over Iraq. More generally, the proportion of Americans who favor removing troops from Iraq as soon as possible continues to increase. Overall, 56% favor a troop withdrawal as soon as possible – the most ever in a Pew Research Center survey – while 39% say the U.S. should keep troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized. In addition, public optimism about U.S. efforts to train Iraqi security forces so they can replace U.S. troops has slipped significantly – 42% believe the U.S. is making progress in this area while 36% believe it is losing ground. This has been an aspect of the Iraq effort where majorities felt that progress was being made.","The survey finds that Americans are less impressed now by the Democratic congressional leadership than when the party took control of Congress in January .

But for many Americans, the reality of the online experience is substantially different. Today nearly two-thirds of Americans own a smartphone, and 19% of Americans rely to some degree on a smartphone for accessing online services and information and for staying connected to the world around them — either because they lack broadband at home, or because they have few options for online access other than their cell phone. Indeed, 7% of Americans own a smartphone but have neither traditional broadband service at home, nor easily available alternatives for going online other than their cell phone. This report documents the unique circumstances of this “smartphone-dependent” population, and also explores the ways in which smartphone owners use their phones to engage in a wide range of activities. Below are some more details about these major findings on the state of smartphone ownership in America today, based on a series of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center in association with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation: Nearly two-thirds of Americans are now smartphone owners, and for many these devices are a key entry point to the online world 64% of \t\tAmerican adults now own a smartphone of some kind, up from 35% in the spring of 2011.  \t\t Smartphone ownership is especially high among younger Americans, as well as those with relatively high income and education levels. And for a number of Americans, smartphones serve as an essential connection to the broader world of online information. The survey measured reliance on smartphones for online access in two different ways — first, by asking smartphone owners whether or not they have traditional broadband service at home, and second, whether they have a reasonable number of options for accessing the internet in general from any location. It found that: In all, one-in-five American adults (19%) indicate that at least one of those conditions apply to them, and \t\t7% of the public says that both of these conditions apply  \t\t — that is, they do not have broadband access at home, and also have relatively few options for getting online other than their cell phone. Throughout this report, we refer to this latter group as “smartphone-dependent” users. Certain groups of Americans rely on smartphones for online access at elevated levels, in particular: Compared with smartphone owners who are less reliant on their mobile devices, these smartphone-dependent users are less likely to own some other type of computing device, less likely to have a bank account, less likely to be covered by health insurance, and more likely to rent or to live with a friend or family member rather than own their own home. Even as a substantial minority of Americans indicate that their phone plays a central role in their ability to access digital services and online content, for many users this access is often intermittent due to a combination of financial stresses and technical constraints. Nearly half \t\t(48%) of smartphone-dependent Americans have had to cancel or shut off their cell phone service for a period of time because the cost of maintaining that service was a financial hardship.  \t\t In addition, 30% of smartphone-dependent Americans say that they “frequently” reach the maximum amount of data that they are allowed to consume as part of their cell phone plan, and 51% say that this happens to them at least occasionally. Each of these figures is substantially higher than those reported by smartphone owners with more access options at their disposal. Smartphones are used for much more than calling, texting, or basic internet browsing. Users are turning to these mobile devices as they navigate a wide range of life events: Lower-income smartphone owners are especially likely to use their phone during a job search. Compared with smartphone owners from households earning $75,000 or more per year, those from households earning less than $30,000 annually are nearly twice as likely to use a smartphone to look for information about a job — and more than four times as likely to use their phone to actually submit a job application. Similarly, “smartphone-dependent” users are much more likely to use their smartphones to access career opportunities. 63% of these smartphone-dependent users have gotten job information on their phone in the last year, and 39% have used their phone to submit a job application. Young adults (85% of whom are smartphone owners) are also incorporating their mobile devices into a host of information seeking and transactional behaviors. About three-quarters of 18-29 year old smartphone owners have used their phone in the last year to get information about a health condition; about seven-in-ten have used their phone to do online banking or to look up information about job; 44% have consumed educational content on their phone; and 34% have used their phone to apply for a job. A substantial majority of smartphone owners use their phone to follow along with news events near and far, and to share details of local happenings with others: Each of these behaviors is common across a diverse group of smartphone owners. Mobile news consumption is common even among older smartphone owners, who tend to use these devices for more basic activities. Four-in-ten smartphone owners ages 65 and older use their phone at least occasionally to keep up with breaking news, half use it to share information about local happenings, and one-third use it to stay abreast of events and activities in their community. Smartphones also play an important role in helping their owners navigate their environment and get where they need to go, especially as a mobile GPS for real-time driving directions: Each of these behaviors is especially prevalent among younger smartphone owners: for instance, 17% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 use their phone to reserve a taxi or car service at least occasionally. Additionally, African American and Latino smartphone owners look up public transit information on their phones at higher rates than whites (37% of black smartphone owners, 30% of Latinos, and 21% of whites do this at least on occasion). When asked to choose from a series of statements representing how they feel about their phone, a substantial majority of smartphone owners feel that these devices are “helpful” rather than “annoying,” “connecting” rather than “distracting,” and that they represent “freedom” rather than a “leash.” At the same time, smartphone owners are relatively divided on the essential necessity of mobile connectivity: \t\t54% say that their phone is “not always needed,” while 46% say that it is something they “couldn’t live without.”  \t\t And while a substantial 80% majority of smartphone owners describe their phone as “worth the cost,” 19% — and 29% of those who pay more than $200 per month for service — describe it as a “financial burden.” In addition to the surveys of smartphone owners that form the main findings of this report, the Pew Research Center also conducted an “experience sampling” survey of smartphone owners as part of this project. In the experience sampling survey, smartphone owners were contacted twice a day over a period of one week and asked how they had used their phone in the hour prior to taking the survey. This analysis offers new insights into how smartphone owners interact with their mobile devices on a day-to-day basis: the features and apps they use; the locations where that use happens; the issues or problems they use their phones to solve; and the emotions they feel as a result. Fully 97% of smartphone owners used text messaging at least once over the course of the study period, making it the most widely-used basic feature or app; it is also the feature that is used most frequently, as the smartphone owners in this study reported having used text messaging in the past hour in an average of seven surveys (out of a maximum total of 14 across the one-week study period). Younger smartphone owners are especially avid users of text messaging, but this group has by no means abandoned voice calls — 93% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 used voice or video calling on at least one occasion during the study period, and reported doing so in an average of 3.9 surveys. Email has long ranked as one of the most common activities that users take part in online since the desktop/laptop era, and it continues to play a prominent role in the mobile era as well. Some 88% of smartphone owners used email on their phone at least once over the course of the study period, making email a more widely-used smartphone feature than social networking, watching video, or using maps and navigation, among others. Three smartphone features in particular — social networking, watching video, and listening to music or podcasts — are especially popular with younger users. Fully 91% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 used social networking on their phone at least once over the course of the study period, compared with 55% of those 50 and older (a 36-point difference). These young smartphone owners reported using social networking in an average of 5.6 surveys, tied with internet use as the second-most frequent smartphone behavior among young adults after text messaging. Features such as watching video and listening to music or podcasts are even more the domain of young smartphone owners. Three-quarters of younger smartphone owners (75%) indicated using their phone to watch videos at least once over the study period, compared with 31% of those 50 and older (a difference of 44 percentage points). And 64% of younger adults used their phones at one time or another to listen to music or podcasts — a 43-point difference compared with the 21% of older users who did so. Younger users stand out especially prominently when it comes to using their phone for two purposes in particular: avoiding boredom, and avoiding people around them. Fully 93% of 18-29 year old smartphone owners in the experience sampling study used their phone at least once to avoid being bored, with respondents in this age group reporting that they did so in average of 5.4 surveys over the one-week study period. Similarly, 47% of young smartphone owners used their phone to avoid interacting with the people around them at least once during the study period, roughly three times the proportion of older smartphone owners who did so. When it comes to the emotions that people experience as a result of having a smartphone, “productive” and “happy” lead the way — 79% and 77% of smartphone owners, respectively, indicated that their phone made them feel this way at least once over the course of the study period. But smartphones do not always inspire positive feelings, as 57% of smartphone owners reported feeling “distracted” thanks to their phone, and 36% reported that their phone made them feel “frustrated.” Younger smartphone owners tend to experience a wider range of these emotions compared with older users — they are more likely to report feeling positive emotions like “happy” or “grateful,” but also more likely to report negative emotions like “distracted” and “angry.” This report is based on data from three different sources, each of which is discussed in more detail below. Basic findings on smartphone ownership and demographics within the U.S. adult population (the first section of Chapter One) are based on telephone surveys conducted December 4-7 and 18-21, 2014 among 2,002 adults. These figures for overall smartphone ownership/usage were collected via telephone survey to make them consistent with past Pew Research Center measurements of smartphone adoption. The margin of error for the total sample of 2,002 adults is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix A. Findings about how smartphone owners use their phones (the remainder of Chapter One, and Chapter Two) are drawn from the October wave of the American Trends Panel, conducted October 3-27, 2014 among 3,181 respondents (2,875 by Web and 306 by mail), including 2,188 smartphone owners. The margin of sampling error for the total sample of 2,188 smartphone owners is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix B. Data about how smartphone owners use their phones over the course of one week (Chapter 3) is taken from the American Trends Panel “experience sampling” survey, conducted November 10-16, 2014 among 1,635 respondents. Respondents were asked to complete two surveys per day for seven days (14 in total), using either an app they had installed on their phone (n=697) or by completing a web survey (n=938). All findings in this report are based on respondents who completed 10 or more surveys over the course of the week-long study period (n=1,035). The margin of sampling error for smartphone owners who completed 10 or more surveys is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix C.","Nearly half ( 48 % ) of smartphone - dependent Americans have had to cancel or shut off their cell phone service for a period of time because the cost of maintaining that service was a financial hardship .

This year’s survey finds negative reactions around much of the world to Donald Trump’s presidency, and major changes in ratings for the U.S. Here are nine charts that highlight international perceptions of Trump. 1Globally, Trump is much less popular than his predecessor. Across 37 countries we surveyed in spring 2017, a median of just 22% said they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. In contrast, 64% expressed confidence in President Barack Obama in these same 37 nations during the final years of his presidency. And this shift in American leadership has clearly had an impact on how the world sees the U.S.: A median of 49% now give the U.S. a favorable rating, down from 64% in the Obama era. 2Only a few countries have positive views of Trump. In just eight of the 37 nations in the study, roughly half or more say they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. The president gets his best reviews in the Philippines, where 69% express trust in him (although this is down from the 94% Obama registered in 2015). Trump also gets mostly positive ratings in sub-Saharan Africa, as did both Obama and former President George W. Bush. Russia, Israel and Vietnam also have confidence in Trump’s ability to handle international relations. 3Trump’s ratings in Western Europe look a lot like Bush’s at the end of his tenure. While Obama was very popular in Western Europe, his presidency was bookended by two very unpopular Republican presidents. Major elements of George W. Bush’s foreign policies met with widespread opposition in the region, and by the time he left office, his ratings in countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain were quite low. Today, Trump gets similar marks as Bush in these four nations. 4Europeans who favor right-wing parties are generally more likely to have confidence in Trump. Those with a favorable view of right-wing parties in France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany tend to express more confidence in Trump. For example, in France, 39% of people with a positive view of Marine Le Pen’s National Front party have confidence in the U.S. president, compared with just 6% among those who have an unfavorable opinion of the National Front. Still, even among those who like right-wing parties, confidence in Trump is limited, and there is no Western European country in which a majority of right-wing party supporters offer a positive assessment of the American president’s leadership in world affairs. 5Trump gets more negative ratings globally than Merkel, Xi or Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the only world leader included in the survey who receives more positive than negative reviews. Across the 37 nations polled, a median of 42% express confidence in her, while 31% say they lack confidence. Ratings for Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are mostly negative, and Trump receives even more unfavorable assessments than both of them. 6Global publics oppose some of Trump’s major policies. We tested five of Trump’s major national security and foreign policy proposals – withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, placing tighter restrictions on people entering the U.S. from certain majority-Muslim nations, pulling out of international climate change agreements, withdrawing from trade deals and building a wall on the Mexican border – and with a few exceptions, they meet with broad disapproval around the world. 7Most say Trump is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, but a majority also sees him as a strong leader. Survey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics and asked whether each one describes Trump. Around the globe, people tend to associate the American leader with all of the negative characteristics tested: Most say he is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, while relatively few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people. Describing Trump as charismatic is more common, though global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic, either. They do, however, see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55% across the nations polled describe him this way. 8Trump gets his lowest ratings in Mexico. Over the past decade, U.S. presidents have gotten mixed or negative reviews in Mexico, but at 5%, Trump registers the lowest confidence rating of any U.S. leader in Mexico since Pew Research Center began surveying there. His rating in Mexico is also the lowest among the 37 nations polled in 2017. The proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high-profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president, and more than nine-in-ten Mexicans oppose it. U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico, and that remains the case this year – though the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015. 9Russians give Trump higher marks than they gave Obama or Bush. Amid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. and its president have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russians’ ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 – the last time the Center polled in Russia – favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common, and Trump gets better reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.","Globally , Trump is much less popular than his predecessor .

S. seen as leading economic power the which one of the following do you think is the world's leading economic power?","In President Barack Obama’s last year in office, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that views of the United States remain strongly favorable in key European and Asian nations. Compared with China, the U.S. is viewed more favorably and seen more often as the world’s leading economic power. Obama continues to receive high confidence ratings, and across the 15 countries surveyed, his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, gets considerably higher marks than Donald Trump. Here are key takeaways from the report. 1Views of the U.S. remain positive, especially when compared with China. Half or more in almost every nation surveyed have a favorable opinion of the U.S. The highest marks for the U.S. are found in Poland, Italy and Japan. About half or more of Indians and Chinese also have a positive view of America. The only country surveyed in which views are negative is Greece, where only 38% have a positive opinion of the U.S. China receives lower ratings than the U.S. in virtually every country surveyed. This includes positive ratings of just 11% from neighboring Japan, and 31% from India. European countries also see China negatively, with no country expressing majority support except Greece, where 57% have a positive view of China. 2As the U.S. economy has slowly grown and added jobs, and as China’s once astronomical growth rates have waned, the percentage of Europeans naming the U.S. as the world’s top economic power has increased, while the share naming China has declined. In 2016, many people across the nations polled say the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power. Australia stands out as the one nation polled where at least half (52%) say China is the top economy in the world, compared with 32% who say it is the U.S. Relatively few respondents in these 16 nations think Japan or the countries of the European Union are the globe’s leading economic power, although 25% of Germans say it is the EU countries. 3Across most nations surveyed, confidence ratings for Barack Obama are high. This includes over 80% confidence in his ability to handle international affairs from people in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Australia and Canada. Confidence in Obama’s international abilities is lower in China (52%) than in most of the other countries surveyed, but it is still positive. Meanwhile, Greeks are the most negative toward Obama, with 58% expressing no confidence in his ability to handle world affairs. Among Americans, about six-in-ten (58%) have confidence in Obama’s handling of world affairs, but views divide sharply along partisan lines: 92% of Democrats have confidence compared with only 21% of Republicans. 4Overall, people in most of the countries surveyed across Europe and Asia have confidence in Hillary Clinton and her ability to handle international affairs. Donald Trump, however, gets negative ratings in nearly every country surveyed. The most confidence in Clinton comes from many of the same places where Obama and the U.S. are broadly popular, such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Much smaller shares in Greece, India and China have confidence in her, although in many places where her confidence ratings are low it is because many people do not offer a response. Trump, on the other hand, is broadly unpopular in every country surveyed. His highest ratings are in China and Italy, yet even there they do not reach a quarter. Furthermore, in Sweden, fully 82% have no confidence at all in Trump. And in the UK, which Trump visited this past week after the momentous Brexit vote, 71% of the public have no confidence in him at all. (The survey was conducted from April to May and includes interviews conducted before Trump and Clinton became their respective parties’ presumptive nominees.) 5People in Europe and Asia see both good and bad qualities in the American people. On the positive side, half or more in 15 of 16 nations say Americans are optimistic, and majorities in 14 countries think Americans are hardworking. However, when it comes to tolerance, fewer than half in 11 countries say that they associate tolerance with the American people. Majorities in the U.S. describe Americans as hardworking (80%), optimistic (74%), and tolerant (65%). On the negative side, half or more in 10 countries think Americans are arrogant and many say they are greedy. And half or more in Australia, Greece, the UK, Spain, Canada and China say Americans are violent.

Our report earlier this year about how Americans think about privacy and sharing personal information was a capstone of this two-and-a-half-year effort that examined how people viewed not only government surveillance but also commercial transactions involving the capture of personal information. Soon after the Snowden leaks surfaced, Americans were almost equally divided in a 2014 survey over whether the leaks had served or harmed the public interest. And, at that time, a majority of Americans believed Snowden should be prosecuted. (A campaign, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, has since been organized to seek a pardon for him.) However much the Snowden revelations may have contributed to the debate over privacy versus anti-terrorism efforts, Americans today – after a series of terrorist events at home and abroad – are more concerned that anti-terrorist programs don’t go far enough than they are about restrictions on civil liberties. An August-September survey found that Americans held that view by a 49% to 33% margin. In this digital age, Americans’ awareness and concerns over issues of privacy also extend beyond the kinds of surveillance programs revealed by Snowden and include how their information is treated by companies with which they do business. Our research also has explored that subject in depth. Here are some of the important findings that emerged from this work: 1Overall, Americans are divided when it comes to their level of concern about surveillance programs. In a survey conducted November 2014-January 2015, 52% described themselves as “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” about government surveillance of Americans’ data and electronic communications, compared with 46% who described themselves as “not very concerned” or “not at all concerned” about the surveillance. Those who followed the news about the Snowden leaks and the ensuing debates were more anxious about privacy policy and their own privacy than those who did not. The public generally believes it is acceptable for the government to monitor many others, including foreign citizens, foreign leaders and American leaders. Yet 57% said it was unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens. At the same time, majorities supported monitoring of those particular individuals who use words like “explosives” and “automatic weapons” in their search engine queries (65% said that) and those who visit anti-American websites (67% said that). 2Some 86% of internet users have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints, but many say they would like to do more or are unaware of tools they could use. The actions that users have taken range from clearing cookies to encrypting their email, from avoiding using their name to using virtual networks that mask their internet protocol (IP) address. And 55% of internet users have taken steps to avoid observation by specific people, organizations or the government. Many say the purpose of their attempted anonymity is to avoid “social surveillance” by friends and colleagues, rather than the government or law enforcement. At the same time, many express a desire to take additional steps to protect their data online. When asked if they feel as though their own efforts to protect the privacy of their personal information online are sufficient, 61% say they feel they “would like to do more,” while 37% say they “already do enough.” Even after news broke about the NSA surveillance programs, few Americans took sophisticated steps to protect their data, and many were unaware of robust actions they could take to hide their online activities. Some 34% of those who said they  were aware of the NSA surveillance programs in a July 2013 survey (30% of all adults) had taken at least one step to hide or shield their information from the government. But most of those actions were simple steps, such as changing their privacy settings on social media or avoiding certain apps, rather than tools like email encryption programs, “don’t track” plug-ins for browsers or anonymity software. 3Americans express a consistent lack of confidence about the security of everyday communication channels and the organizations that control them – particularly when it comes to the use of online tools. And they exhibited a deep lack of faith in organizations of all kinds, public or private, in protecting the personal information they collect. Only tiny minorities say they are “very confident” that the records maintained by these organizations will remain private and secure. 4Some 74% say it is “very important” to them that they be in control of who can get information about them, and 65% say it is “very important” to them to control what information is collected about them. Personal control matters a lot to people. If the traditional American view of privacy is the “right to be left alone,” the 21st-century refinement of that idea is the right to control their identity and information. They understand that modern life won’t allow them to be “left alone” and untracked, but they do want to have a say in how their personal information is used. 5Many Americans struggle to understand the nature and scope of data collected about them. When it comes to their own role in managing their personal information, most adults are not sure what information is being collected or how it is being used. While half of those surveyed said they felt confident they understood how their information would be used, 47% said they were not, and many of these people felt confused, discouraged or impatient when trying to make decisions about sharing their personal information with companies. 6Fully 91% of adults agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control of how personal information is collected and used by companies. Half of internet users said they worry about the amount of information available about them online, and most said they knew about key pieces of their personal information that could be found on the internet. Only 9% say they feel they have “a lot” of control over how much information is collected about them and how it is used. Indeed, experts we canvassed about the future of privacy argued that privacy was no longer a “condition” of American life. Rather, they asserted that it was becoming a commodity to be purchased. 7For most Americans who are making decisions about sharing their information in return for a product, service or other benefit, the context and conditions of the transactions matter. When considering this basic digital era trade-off, many are in an “It depends” frame of mind. Risk-benefit calculations that enter people’s minds during the decision process include the terms of the deal; the circumstances of their lives; whether they consider the company or organization involved to be trustworthy; what happens to their data after they are collected, especially if the data are made available to third parties; and how long the data will be retained. For instance, 54% of Americans consider it an acceptable trade-off to have surveillance cameras in the office in order to improve workplace security and help reduce thefts. But a scenario involving the use of a “smart thermostat” in people’s homes that might save energy costs in return for insight about people’s comings and goings was deemed “acceptable” by only 27% of adults. It was seen as “not acceptable” by 55%. Indeed, most Americans assign different degrees of value to different pieces of information. Social Security numbers are ranked as the most sensitive information, while people’s purchasing habits ranked lowest as something they felt was very sensitive. 8Young adults generally are more focused than their elders when it comes to online privacy. Younger adults are more likely to know that personal information about them is available online and to have experienced privacy problems. By the same token, our surveys have found that those ages 18 to 29 are more likely than older adults to say they have paid attention to privacy issues, tried to protect their privacy and reported some kind of harm because of privacy problems. They are more likely to have limited the amount of personal information available about them online, changed privacy settings, deleted unwanted comments on social media, removed their name from photos in which they were tagged, and taken steps to mask their identities while online. It is also true that younger adults are more likely to have shared personal information online. 9A majority of the U.S. public believes changes in law could make a difference in protecting privacy – especially when it comes to policies on retention of their data. In the midst of all this uncertainty and angst about privacy, Americans are generally in favor of additional legal protections against abuses of their data. Some 68% of internet users believe current laws are not good enough in protecting people’s privacy online; and 64% believe the government should do more to regulate advertisers. Most expect at least some limits on retention policies by data collections. And a majority (64%) support more regulation of advertisers and the way they handle personal information. When asked about the data the government collects as part of anti-terrorism efforts, 65% of Americans say there are not adequate limits on “what telephone and internet data the government can collect.” 10Many technology experts predict that few individuals will have the energy or resources to protect themselves from “dataveillance” in the coming years and that privacy protection will likely become a luxury good. Another prediction from 2,511 experts we canvassed was that the prospect of achieving bygone notions of privacy will become more remote as the Internet of Things takes hold and people’s homes, workplaces and the objects around them will “tattle” on them. A more hopeful theme about privacy’s future was sounded by experts who argued that new technology tools would become available that would give consumers power to negotiate on equal footing with corporations about information sharing and also allow them to work around governments trying to collect data.

(%) Excited Relieved Disappointed Angry ","Voters who support Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offer a variety of reasons why they do so, ranging from the candidates’ issue positions to their personal backgrounds. But a major factor for both groups, beyond their candidate’s attributes, is who they are not: Asked in an open-ended format, 33% of Trump supporters and about as many Clinton supporters (32%) frame their vote at least partially in opposition to the other candidate, often using harsh language. Among Clinton supporters, only her experience, at 32%, is mentioned as frequently as opposition to Trump. For Trump supporters, opposition to Clinton is among the most frequently cited factors for supporting their candidate, with nearly as many citing his status as a political outsider (27%) or his policy stances (26%). This “opposition as support” takes place in the context of an election campaign that is far more likely to be viewed in negative than positive terms: Majorities of Americans describe themselves as “frustrated” and “disgusted” with the campaign, while few declare themselves “interested”, “optimistic” or “excited.” And these negative takes have only become more widespread over the course of the summer. The survey conducted August 16-September 12 online and by mail among 4,538 adults, including 3,941 registered voters, provides a unique perspective on voters’ feelings about the presidential candidates. Many voters have unqualified praise for their preferred candidate. A 78-year-old woman supporting Clinton describes her as “a seasoned veteran” who “can get things done,” and adds: “We need a woman!” A 43-year-old man who backs Trump says the main reason is that “he’s not a career politician, and he doesn’t owe politicians anything. He’s got real-world experience that most career politicians lack.” Yet sizable shares in both camps focus at least partly – or in many cases exclusively – on the flaws or shortcomings of the opposing candidate. Several voters, including a 41-year-old woman who is supporting Clinton, describe their choice as “the lesser of two evils.” A 49-year-old man who backs Trump says: “As bad as he is, I think Hillary is worse for our country.” Clinton and Trump supporters also were asked about concerns they have, if any, about their own candidate. Roughly six-in-ten Trump supporters (62%) and half of Clinton supporters (50%) offer a concern about the candidate they support (the remainder assert that they have no concerns or do not give an answer). For Trump supporters, the candidate’s character and personality is mentioned far more frequently than any other concern. Four-in-ten registered voters who support Trump point to his personality as their main concern – with 34% specifically referring to his temperament or speaking style. Some Trump supporters express blunt criticisms of their candidate. One 65-year-old woman describes him as a “temperamental child saying anything in an attempt to get what he wants.” A 40-year-old woman points to Trump’s “temper” as a concern, but adds that she likes “his honesty and hard-line beliefs.” Fewer Clinton supporters (18%) cite her character and personality as a concern, but most of those who do (17% of Clinton supporters overall) specifically refer to concerns about honesty or secrecy. An additional 16% cite Clinton’s past or some of her associations, such as her ties to Wall Street, her husband’s administration, the Clinton Foundation or actions associated with her time as Secretary of State (including her use of a private email server). A 45-year-old man who supports Clinton says she is “too guarded and not transparent enough. [She] doesn’t speak to the media” and “is naturally defensive when it comes to any criticism.” A 36-year-old woman says that while Clinton would make a “fine president,” she adds she is “concerned about her trustworthiness.” The new survey also finds that, no matter who wins on Nov. 8, few voters anticipate feeling excited about the outcome. Just 11% of all registered voters say they would be excited if Trump won, 26% say they would be relieved, while a majority says they would be disappointed (34%) or angry (25%). Just 12% overall would be excited if Clinton wins, while 36% would be relieved; nearly half would be disappointed (29%) or angry (20%). Far more Clinton and Trump supporters say they would feel relieved than excited if their candidate wins. Just a quarter of Clinton supporters (25%) and a similar share of Trump backers (28%) say they would be excited if their candidate were to win. As previous Pew Research Center surveys have found, voters have very negative feelings about the presidential campaign. Far more say they have been feeling frustrated (57%), disgusted (55%) or scared (43%) than say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) or excited (just 10%). Yet only 9% of voters say they feel indifferent about the campaign. Trump and Clinton supporters express similar levels of frustration (55% and 53%, respectively) and differ little in their feelings of disgust (53% vs. 48%) or fear (46% vs. 41%). Negative feelings about the campaign rose over the summer. The share of voters saying they’ve been feeling frustrated has risen 8 percentage points since earlier in the summer (from 49% to 57%). Similarly, a larger share now say they are disgusted (45% then, 55% now), while slightly more now say they are scared than said this two months ago (37% then, 43% now). There has been little change in the share expressing positive feelings about the campaign over the course of the summer. Voters offer thoughtful comments about why they support their candidate for president. Below are some illustrative examples of the more than 3,100 comments from voters in the nationally representative, randomly selected, American Trends Panel. Many backers of Trump and Clinton offer concerns they have about the candidate that they plan to vote for in November (though some supporters also take this opportunity to offer full-throated endorsements). Below is a sampling of voters concerns about their own candidates. When presented with a list of factors that might influence their vote choice, dislike of the opposition again ranks high for both Trump and Clinton supporters as a major reason for backing their candidate: Roughly two-thirds of voters who favor Donald Trump (67%) and Hillary Clinton (64%) say this. Among Trump supporters, only the candidate’s views on terrorism (78%) and the economy (76%) rank higher than dislike of Clinton on a list of major reasons for supporting him. And among Clinton supporters, only her experience in government (79%) ranks higher than dislike of Trump, though roughly as many of her backers cite her leadership ability (67%) as a major reason underlying their support. Clinton supporters are 30 percentage points less likely than Trump supporters to cite their candidate’s views on terrorism as a major reason for supporting them (48% vs. 78%). By contrast, nearly twice as many Clinton supporters (55%) as Trump supporters (28%) cite their candidate’s views on race relations as a major reason for support. While a sizable majority of Clinton supporters (79%) cite her experience as a major reason for why they back the former Secretary of State, nearly half of Trump supporters (47%) say his lack of prior government experience as a major reason they are voting for him. A greater share of Clinton backers than Trump supporters say loyalty to the party’s nominee is a major reason for their support: 43% of Clinton voters say they support her because she’s the Democratic Party’s nominee, but just 28% of Trump supporters say a major reason they back him is because he’s the Republican Party’s nominee. Neither side has many voters who say the candidates’ personalities are a major reason for their support (18% of Trump; 32% of Clinton). The historic nature of Clinton’s candidacy is not a major reason for her supporters to vote for her this fall. About three-in-ten (29%) say Clinton’s potential to become the first woman to win the White House is a major reason they support her. About four-in-ten Clinton supporters (41%) say her gender is not a reason at all for their support of her.","The new survey also finds that , no matter who wins on Nov. 8 , few voters anticipate feeling excited about the outcome .

About four-in-ten adults (38%) say they are “not too” or “not at all” confident that they will have enough income and assets for their retirement, according to a 2012 survey. That’s up 13 percentage points from the 25% who expressed that concern in a Pew Research survey in early 2009. An analysis of these surveys also shows that concerns about retirement financing are now more heavily concentrated among younger and middle-aged adults than among those closer to retirement age — a major shift in the pattern that had prevailed at the end of the recession. In 2009 it was “Gloomy Boomers” in their mid-50s who were the most worried that they would outlive their retirement nest eggs. In the more recent survey, retirement worries peak among adults in their late 30s – many of whom are the older sons and daughters of the Baby Boom generation. The 2012 survey finds that among adults between the ages of 36 and 40, 53% say they are either “not too” or “not at all” confident that their income and assets will last through retirement.

By nearly two-to-one (59% to 31%), the public favors building the pipeline, which would carry crude from Canadian oil sands to ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to a November 2014 survey. Yet overall support is down from March 2013 when 66% favored the project. Support has held firm among Republicans (83% in favor) but declined among Democrats (43%) and independents (58%). While Democratic support for building the pipeline has fallen, Democrats remain internally divided over its construction. Support for the increased use of fracking has declined. Overall, 41% favored the increased use of fracking to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations while 47% are opposed, according to last November’s poll. In March 2013, there was more support (48%) than opposition (38%) to increased use of the drilling technique. Republicans support increased fracking far more than Democrats, by a 62% to 29% margin. There was a particularly dramatic change of views in the Midwest where increased use of fracking is now opposed by a 47% to 39% margin compared with the majority who favored its use in 2013. The substantial growth in U.S. energy production has done little to change public attitudes about energy policies. In broad terms, developing alternative energy is viewed (by 60% to 30%) as a more important priority than expanding the exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas, according to a December 2014 survey. Yet when asked about specific policies to address the energy supply, a majority of Americans continue to support allowing more offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters (56%) and more mining and drilling on federally owned land (58%) — opinions largely unchanged from previous years. About eight-in-ten (81%) Americans support requirements for better fuel efficiency for cars and trucks. There is broad public support for stricter limits on power plant emissions. About two-thirds (64%) of the American public said in a November survey that they favored stricter limits on power plant emissions to mitigate climate change, while a 31% minority opposed stricter limits on emissions. Views on regulating emissions were divided along partisan lines. Democrats were far more supportive than Republicans of stricter emission limits on power plants to address climate change. Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats (77%) favored these measures compared with 67% of independents. Among Republicans, as many said they opposed as said they favored these efforts (47% each). There is strong public support for efforts to protect the environment, but many question the costs. Environmental protection draws more support in principle than when the issue of potential costs is raised. Among the public, 71% said the country “should do whatever it takes to protect the environment,” according to a January-March 2014 survey. But a smaller majority (56%) said “stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost.” Nearly four-in-ten (39%) said tougher environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy. There are sharp partisan divides on these questions. Democrats overwhelmingly, by eight-to-one, said that the country should do whatever it takes to safeguard the environment while Republicans are almost evenly divided. About seven-in-ten (71%) Democrats believe stricter environmental laws are worth the cost compared with just 37% of Republicans. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans (59%) said stricter environmental laws and regulations have a negative economic impact. Some of the largest partisan gaps when it comes to the public’s priorities are over the environment. The partisan divide over dealing with global warming is especially striking. A January survey found 54% of Democrats view this as a top priority for the president and Congress compared with just 15% of Republicans. Democrats also are 31 points more likely than Republicans to prioritize protecting the environment (66% of Democrats vs. 35% of Republicans).

This survey includes far more information about respondents than is found in a typical election poll: Their underlying attitudes on a wide range of political issues, drawn from the largest political survey in the Center’s history; a track of voter preferences over the course of 2014; and a link to their actual voting histories. The new wave of the panel survey was conducted Sept. 9-Oct. 3 with 3,154 adults who are part of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, a nationally representative group of randomly selected U.S. adults surveyed online and by mail. These respondents are a subset of the more than 10,000 adults interviewed earlier this year as part of a year-long series of reports on political polarization in the American public. Here are the key findings from the latest wave of the panel survey: The likely electorate is more polarized than the public. As we noted in our first major report on political polarization, the most ideologically-oriented Americans are also the most politically active, while many in the center “remain on the edges of the political playing field.” This is the case when it comes to which ideological groups are most likely to vote on Nov. 4. Those who are consistently conservative and liberal, who together make up only about one-in-five (22%) in the general public, make up 36% of those most likely to vote. By contrast, those with mixed opinions will be only 24% of the electorate, although they constitute 39% of the general public. (Click here for details about how ideological consistency is measured.) Although overall turnout among the public is likely to be around 40%, 73% of those who hold consistently conservative attitudes are likely to vote in the midterm, as are 52% of those with mostly conservative views. As other surveys have found, voters on the left are less politically engaged in this election: 58% of those with consistently liberal views and just 32% of those with mostly liberal attitudes are likely to turn out. And among those with about an equal mix of conservative and liberal attitudes, just 25% are likely to go to the polls. Hostility toward the opposing party is a key marker of polarization and a strong motivator for voting, especially among Republicans. Both Republicans and Democrats have long held negative views of the opposite party. But the level of partisan hostility has grown dramatically in the past 20 years. The new panel survey finds a strong link between having a highly negative reaction to the opposing party and likelihood of turning out to vote, particularly among Republicans. Among Republicans and Republican leaners with a very unfavorable view of the Democratic Party in the current survey, 65% are likely voters; among Republicans and GOP leaners who have mostly unfavorable views of the Democratic Party, just 40% are likely to vote. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 49% of those with very unfavorable opinions of the GOP are likely to vote, compared with 33% of those with mostly unfavorable views. Voting preferences have been fairly stable in this relatively low profile midterm election year. Roughly nine-in-ten respondents who said they were voting Democratic in June are still leaning Democrat; about as many Republicans say the same. Among likely voters, however, shifts among the relatively small number of undecided or third-party voters in June slightly favor the Republicans. Ticket splitting? Don’t expect much. The survey suggests that voters who split their ballot between Republicans and Democrats will be relatively rare in the states and districts where there are tickets to be split. An analysis of likely voters living in areas with two or three major political contests this fall suggests about eight-in-ten voters (81%) will vote a straight party ticket. Who voted in the primaries? Highest reported rate: consistent conservatives. Primaries often hold the key to the general election, in that they determine the choices available to voters. Is there polarization there? Absolutely. We find that 64% of consistent conservatives reported voting in a primary election this year, compared with 49% of consistent liberals. The self-reported turnout numbers are lower among those with ‘mostly’ conservative or liberal views, though the pattern of higher turnout on the right remains, with 46 percent of ‘mostly conservative’ voters having cast a primary ballot and 30 percent of ‘mostly liberal’ voters. Vote choices are strongly related to voters’ underlying political attitudes and values, as evidenced by the fact that ideologically consistent voters are nearly uniformly supportive of the candidates of their respective political parties. Among likely voters who are consistent conservatives, 97% say they will vote for the Republican candidate for U.S. House in their district; 91% of those with mostly conservative opinions will also do so. Among those with consistently liberal views, 94% say they will vote Democratic, followed by 84% among those with mostly liberal views. Likely voters with ideologically mixed views divide more evenly (49% Democratic, 40% Republican). Despite the intense campaign that has raged throughout 2014, and the national and international events that many observers believe have roiled the political landscape, preferences for Democratic or Republican candidates for Congress have remained unchanged for the vast majority of voters this year.1 Members of the American Trends Panel were first asked in February for their preference in the election for U.S. House, and again in June. Among registered voters in the current survey, very few report a difference choice today than in June or in February. Republicans retain 91% of those who said in the June survey that they would choose the Republican candidate for Congress, while 92% of voters who chose a Democrat for Congress in June remain committed to a Democratic candidate. About half of voters who chose a third party candidate or were not sure of their vote in June now support one of the two major parties in October, splitting about evenly between Republicans and Democrats (30% Republican, 24% Democratic). Among likely voters, however, shifts among third party or undecided voters have slightly favored the Republicans, adding perhaps one point to their advantage over the Democrats. Hostility to the opposing party is a key marker of polarization and is a strong motivator to vote, especially among conservatives and Republicans. Ideology and partisan antipathy are related: Those holding ideologically consistent opinions are far more likely than others to view the opposing party negatively, and even to view it as a threat to the nation’s well-being. Among Republicans and Republican leaners with a very unfavorable view of the Democratic Party in the current survey, 65% are likely voters, compared with only 49% among Democrats with a very unfavorable view of the Republican Party. Those who are less hostile to the opposite party are considerably less likely to vote. Among Republicans, 40% of those with a mostly unfavorable view of Democrats are likely to vote, and only 23% of those with positive views (or who offer no opinion) of the Democratic Party are likely to vote. On the other side, 33% of Democrats with a mostly unfavorable view of the Republican Party are forecasted to turn out, as are 19% of those with positive views of (or no opinion about) the GOP. As voters become more polarized ideologically, fewer opt to select candidates from more than one political party when they go to the polls. According to the American National Election Study, ticket-splitting reached an all-time low in 2012 with only 13% of voters selecting a different political party for the U.S. Senate than the U.S. House. An analysis of voters living in areas with two or three major political contests this November shows that only 12% of registered voters say they are splitting their vote between multiple political parties. About three-quarters of registered voters (74%) in these areas say they will select candidates from the same party for all major political races in their area, known as “straight ticket” voting.2 When narrowed to those most likely to vote in the November election, about eight-in-ten voters (81%) choose a straight party ticket. They are slightly more likely to select only Republican candidates than only Democratic candidates (43% to 36%). Majorities of Democratic (78%) and Republican (74%) registered voters are voting straight down their party’s ticket for major races. Even among self-identified independents who are registered to vote, 65% say they will vote a straight ticket. Independents are seven points slightly more likely to choose a straight Republican ticket than a straight Democratic ticket (33% to 26%). Voters who hold consistent ideological viewpoints are highly likely to vote a straight party ticket. Nearly nine-in-ten (87%) with consistently conservative views choose Republican candidates down the line, while 84% of those with consistently liberal views choose a straight Democratic ticket. Even among voters with ideologically mixed views, most (61%) still choose a slate of candidates from one party; 18% split their tickets between parties. Consistent conservatives are considerably more likely than consistent liberals and those in other groups to report voting in the 2014 primaries. Looking at the approximately 80% of panelists for whom a record exists in the voter file, the same pattern is true in 2010. Asked about voting in this year’s primary elections, 38% of those surveyed say they have voted. (Self-reported voting rates tend to be considerably higher than actual turnout.) This varies from 29% among those with ideologically mixed opinions to 64% among those with consistently conservative views. Among those with consistently liberal opinions, 49% say they voted in a primary. Among those with mostly conservative views, 46% say they voted in a primary. Among those with mostly liberal opinions, 30% say they voted. The pattern was very similar in the 2010 primaries, based on voter records, but the estimated level of turnout is considerably lower than 2014 self-reports (25% of those matched to the voter file were recorded as voting in a primary). Consistent conservatives again stand out, with 48% recorded as having voted in a primary in 2010, compared with 32% among consistent liberals, 29% among those with mostly conservative views, 22% among those with consistent liberal views and just 14% among those with mixed views. These patterns of turnout mean that conservatives and liberals make up a larger majority of primary voters than they do among all partisans in the general public. Among Republicans and those who lean Republican, 69% of 2014 primary voters (and 77% in 2010) are either consistently or mostly conservative in their views. Among Democrats and leaners, 64% in 2014 (and 75% in 2010) are consistently or mostly liberal. To be sure, most partisans tilt in the ideological direction of their party. But primaries exaggerate this tilt. Nonetheless, the most ideological voters still do not constitute a majority within their own party’s primary electorates. Among Republicans and those who lean Republican, consistent conservatives constitute 32% of self-reported 2014 primary voters and 37% of 2010 primary voters in the voter file, compared with 21% and 23% overall among Republicans. Similarly, among Democrats, consistent liberals make up 34% of those who say they voted in the 2014 primary and 42% among 2010 voters in the voter file; by comparison, they constitute 26% and 29% of all Democrats and leaners of the general public in 2014 and 2010, respectively. In a year where spending on political ad spending is poised to break $1 billion, with nearly half of that being spent on negative ads, more than a third of likely voters (36%) say that negativity toward the opposing party is driving their vote on Election Day. This number is about the same among supporters of Republican and Democratic candidates this November. About half of voters (48%) view their choice as a vote in favor of their own party. Ideologically consistent voters are more likely to see party as a factor in their vote this November; only 10% of each group say party is not a factor. Those voters who hold ideologically mixed viewpoints are less likely than the average to see their vote in partisan terms (26% say the parties are not a factor). A 46% plurality say that voting for their party is the driving factor in their vote, while 27% say they are voting against the other party. On both sides, the plurality reason of support for one’s party is shared values (38% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats say this). However, hostility towards the opposing party still seems to be a driving force in the vote, even for those who say their vote is for their own party. Among Republicans, the number two reason for voting in favor of their own party is disagreement with Democrats (17%). Similarly, 8% of Democrats say that disagreement with Republicans is a top reason to vote for the Democratic Party. Among Republican voters who are voting more against the Democrats, about one-in-four (26%) mainly say it’s because they do not share the same values. In addition, 14% mention the Democrats’ government mismanagement and 12% specifically name fiscal policies and disagreements about the size of government. The top issue for Democrats who consider their vote as against the Republicans is the GOP’s obstructionism and lack of compromise (29%). And two-in-ten (20%) each cite the Republican Party’s lack of support for the middle class and overall disagreement with the party’s platform.","In a year where spending on political ad spending is poised to break $ 1 billion , with nearly half of that being spent on negative ads , more than a third of likely voters ( 36 % ) say that negativity toward the opposing party is driving their vote on Election Day .

But among those who have children, there are notable differences in perceptions of who actually does more of the work around the house. More than half of married U.S. adults (56%) – both with and without children – say sharing household chores is “very important” to a successful marriage, according to the most recent report from Pew Research Center’s Religious Landscape Study. That ranks behind having shared interests (64%) and a satisfying sexual relationship (61%), but ahead of having children (43%) and having adequate income (42%). Among married adults, men are slightly more likely than women to say sharing household chores is very important to a successful marriage (63% vs. 58%). And those ages 18 to 29 (67%) and ages 30 to 49 (63%) are more likely to say sharing chores is very important, compared with 57% of those ages 50 to 64 and 56% of those 65 and older. According to a separate Pew Research Center survey of American parents conducted in 2015, half of married or cohabiting couples living with at least one child under age 18 say their household chores are split about equally. But 41% say the mother does more, while 8% say the father does more. The workload is seen as somewhat more equitable in households where both parents work full time: 59% of adults in this type of household say chores are divided about equally, while 31% say the mother does more and 9% say the father does more. To be sure, even among couples where both partners work full time, the number of hours worked may differ significantly, and this could in turn influence how household chores are distributed. Previous research  indicates that, among full-time working parents, fathers work more hours, on average, than mothers do. And indeed, personal earnings, which are linked to hours worked outside the home, are associated with how U.S. parents perceive the way their household chores are split. Those who earn about the same as their partner are more likely to say the division of household labor is about equal (65%) than those who earn less (52%) or more (51%). Among those parents who earn less than their partner, 41% say they personally take on more chores than their partner, while just 6% say their partner does more around the house. And among those who earn more than their partner, 29% say their partner does the larger share of chores, compared with 20% who say they personally do more. Perceptions about how chores are delegated differ significantly by gender. Fathers are more likely than mothers to say the chores are split about evenly between both partners in their household (56% vs. 46%). Fully half of mothers (50%) say they take up more responsibilities around the house than their partner, compared with just 12% of fathers who say they do more around the house. About one-third of fathers (32%) say their spouse or partner takes on more of the responsibility for chores in their household, compared with just 4% of mothers who say the father does more.","More than half of married U.S. adults ( 56 % ) – both with and without children – say sharing household chores is “ very important ” to a successful marriage , according to the most recent report from Pew Research Center ’s Religious Landscape Study .

A majority of registered voters (58%) say they have given at least some thought to candidates who may run for president in 2016, but that is 10 points lower than at a comparable point in the 2008 campaign – the last time both parties had contested nominations. Yet, even at this early stage, the vast majority of voters (87%) say they care a good deal about who wins the presidency, and 72% say they care which party prevails. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted March 25-29 among 1,500 adults, including 1,097 registered voters, finds stark differences in the way the possible Democratic and Republican fields are shaping up. Among the potential set of Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton has a wide lead over other possible contenders, with fully 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters saying there is a good chance they would vote for her (86% say there is at least some chance they would). By contrast, no Republican stands out among the party’s crowded field: Of 10 possible GOP contenders asked about in the current survey, no candidate garners solid support from more than a quarter of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters. Though Jeb Bush is widely known by Republican voters, just 23% say there is a good chance they would vote for him, while 41% say there is some chance; 25% say there is no chance they would vote for the former Florida governor. Mike Huckabee has similar levels of both recognition and support among Republican voters. By comparison, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Ben Carson are all less well known, yet about as many GOP voters say there is a good chance they would vote for each of them as say this about Bush. Walker and Carson, in particular, are relatively unfamiliar potential candidates in the GOP race, but they fare well among the subset of Republican voters who have heard of them. Just 57% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters have heard of Wisconsin Gov. Walker, yet 23% say there is a good chance they would vote for him and just 7% say there is no chance. And Carson has name recognition only among 48% of GOP voters, but 21% say there is a good chance he would get their vote while just 5% say there is no chance of this. Chris Christie sits on the other end of the spectrum. Though relatively well-known (83% of GOP voters have heard of the New Jersey governor), there is little potential support for a Christie candidacy: Just 9% of GOP voters say there is a good chance they would vote for him, while nearly four-in-ten (39%) say there is no chance. In contrast to the tight Republican field, Hillary Clinton enjoys broad support among Democratic voters. Potential rivals for her party’s nomination have much softer levels of support among Democrats. Fully 59% of Democratic voters say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton, while an additional 28% say there is some chance (just 10% say there is no chance). Though Joe Biden is similarly well-known, just 22% say there is a good chance they would vote for him, while 47% say there is some chance of this (23% say there is no chance). About two-in-ten (21%) also say there is a good chance they would vote for Elizabeth Warren, although only 63% of Democratic voters have heard of her. (Warren has frequently said she is not running for the office.) The remainder of the potential Democratic field is much less well-known, with fewer than half of Democratic voters having heard of Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb or Martin O’Malley. Though there is the prospect of having both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush — two candidates related to recent presidents — in the 2016 race, there is little sign that this is a concern among their respective constituencies. Three-quarters (75%) of Republican voters say it doesn’t really bother them that the Bush family continues to play a large role in the GOP, while fully 88% of Democratic voters say they aren’t bothered by the Clintons’ continued role in the Democratic Party. At this stage in the race, 52% of voters say it is more important to them that a presidential candidate will compromise with the other party than that he or she will stick to their core values and positions (41%). Democratic voters, in particular, place value on candidates who will make compromises: 63% say this, compared with 31% who prioritize sticking to core values. Republican voters, by contrast, are more likely to value candidates who stick to their core values (57% vs. 35%). Within the party coalitions there are differences on these measures among each candidate’s supporters, particularly within the GOP. Among Republican voters, those who say there is a good chance they would vote for Bush are more supportive of a candidate who would compromise with the other party than are supporters of Cruz, Carson, Walker, or Paul. And half of voters (50%) say “experience and a proven record” is more important to them than “new ideas and a different approach” (43%). Republicans (59%) are more likely than either Democrats (46%) or independents (48%) to prioritize a proven record. As the 114th Congress nears its 100-day mark, overall views of the institution remain at a near-record low: Today, just 22% of Americans have a favorable view of Congress. Views of the GOP Congressional leadership are little changed over the last few months as well; Mitch McConnell continues to be viewed more unfavorably (38%) than favorably (23%), though many Americans say they have no opinion of the Senate majority leader. And John Boehner — who is substantially better known than his Senate counterpart — is viewed much more unfavorably (51%) than favorably (22%). Overall views of Barack Obama are little changed since the beginning of the year. Currently 46% approve of his job performance, while 47% disapprove. About half (51%) have a favorable view of Obama personally, while 46% have an unfavorable impression. These ratings have changed little since the beginning of last year. With the 2016 election more than a year and a half away, most voters have yet to fully engage with it—just 26% say they have given a lot of thought to the 2016 candidates, while 58% say they have given at least some thought. Overall, there is less interest in the campaign today than there was in March 2007 (when 68% had given the candidates at least some thought). At that stage of the 2008 election, all of the major candidates from both parties had formally announced their candidacies. As of today, just one 2016 candidate—Ted Cruz—has formally declared an intention to run. Today, Democrats, Republicans, and independents are about equally likely to say they have given thought to 2016 candidates. In March 2007, Democratic voters were somewhat more attentive to the election than their Republican counterparts (71% said they had given it at least some thought, compared with 64% of GOP voters). Among all registered voters, Hillary Clinton registers the greatest share of support. One-third (33%) of voters say there is a good chance they would vote for her, while an additional 19% say there is at least some chance. No more than 13% say there is a good chance they would vote for any single other candidate. However, among the field of possible candidates beyond Clinton, there is little differentiation at this early stage. This is particularly the case when it comes to possible GOP contenders: Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Ben Carson all have about one-in-ten registered voters saying there is a good chance they would vote for them. At this stage, there is considerable variance in awareness of potential candidates. Virtually all voters have heard of Clinton, and Biden and Jeb Bush also are widely known. Among the other Republicans, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio are familiar to at least two-thirds of voters. But fewer than half of all voters have heard of Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson or Scott Walker. Among the other Democrats, just over half of voters have heard of Elizabeth Warren and less than a third say they are familiar with either Jim Webb or Martin O’Malley. No single GOP contender emerges as the clear preference of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters. Jeb Bush is by far the best known among GOP voters, followed by Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie and Rand Paul. Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee lead the pack, both in overall name recognition and in the proportion of GOP voters who say they would consider voting for each: 63% of Republican voters say there is at least some chance they would vote for Bush (23% good chance), with about as many (61%) saying this about Huckabee. Smaller majorities of GOP voters also say there is at least some chance they would vote for Rand Paul (57%), Marco Rubio (55%) and Ted Cruz (54%). Republican voters’ overall support for Scott Walker (44% at least some chance) and Ben Carson (39% at least some chance) lags behind these other candidates, but that is largely because of their relative unfamiliarity within the GOP base. Both men are known by fewer than six-in-ten Republicans; yet among those who are familiar with each candidate, both men have more support than other candidates. All of the possible Republican candidates asked about are better known among conservative Republican voters than among the party’s moderates and liberals. And most candidates draw more support among conservatives, although the differences are greater for some than others. For example, three-in-ten conservative Republican voters say there is a good chance they would vote for Ted Cruz (30%) or Scott Walker (30%), while just 10% of moderate and liberal Republicans say this about either man. About twice as many GOP conservatives (25%) as moderates and liberals (13%) say there is a good chance they would support Ben Carson. There is a narrower gap in support for Jeb Bush: 25% of conservative Republican voters and 17% of moderate and liberal Republican voters say there is a good chance they would vote for the former Florida governor. Chris Christie is relatively well known among both conservative and moderate and liberal Republican voters, but draws little support from either group. Just 11% of conservative Republicans and 6% of moderate and liberal Republicans say they see a good chance of supporting Christie; 40% and 37%, respectively, say there is no chance they would vote for the New Jersey governor. Currently, seven GOP presidential candidates draw potentially strong support from 20% or more Republican and Republican-leaning voters. At a slightly later point in the 2012 campaign (May 2011), there were only two candidates – Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin – for whom 20% or more GOP voters said there was a good chance of voting. Similarly, in February 2007, only two GOP candidates surpassed the 20% mark: 34% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said there was a good chance they would support Rudy Giuliani and 22% said the same about John McCain. In February 1999, about half of Republican voters saw a good chance of voting for George W. Bush (52%) in the 2000 election, and 35% said there was a good chance they would vote for Elizabeth Dole. An overwhelming majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters (86%) say there is either a good chance (59%) or some chance (28%) they would vote for Hillary Clinton. A majority (69%) of Democrats say there is at least some chance they would support Joe Biden, though just 22% say there is a good chance they would do so. About as many Democratic voters (21%) say there is a good chance they would vote for Senator Elizabeth Warren, despite being substantially less well known than the vice president. Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb and Martin O’Malley are little recognized, and fewer than a quarter of Democratic voters currently say there is any chance they would vote for them. Though support for Clinton is widespread among Democratic voters, there is a gender gap in the strength of her support among white Democratic voters. Overall, 62% of women and 54% of men say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton. But these differences are particularly evident among whites: 61% of white Democratic women say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton compared with 43% of white Democratic men. Conversely, more white Democratic men (45%) than women (26%) see some chance of voting for Clinton. Only about 10% in each group sees no chance of voting for her. Support for Clinton is greater among liberal Democratic voters (66% of whom say there is a good chance they would vote for her) than among conservative and moderate Democratic voters (53% say this). Still, large majorities of both groups (91% of liberal Democratic voters and 83% of conservative and moderate Democratic voters) say there is at least some chance they would cast a ballot for her. Joe Biden garners about equal levels of support from both liberals and moderates in the party, while Elizabeth Warren has greater support among the party’s liberals. Nearly a third (32%) of liberal Democratic and Democratic leaning voters say there is a good chance they’d vote for her, while just 14% of conservative and moderate Democratic voters say this. To some extent, this reflects liberals’ greater familiarity with Warren: 70% of liberal Democratic voters have heard of Warren, compared with 56% of conservative and moderate Democrats. Democrats’ early preferences for the 2016 election are similar to those at a comparable point in the 2008 election in one respect: A large share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say there is a good chance they would vote for Hillary Clinton. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say that today; 52% said that at a comparable point in the campaign eight years ago. But the Democratic field in 2007 was very different than it is today. Currently, about one-in-five Democrats say there is a good chance they would vote for Joe Biden (22%) if he were to decide to run and about as many say the same about Elizabeth Warren (21%), who has repeatedly indicated no interest in being a candidate. At about this point in 2007, Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards had all announced their candidacies; 32% of Democrats said there was a good chance they would support Obama and 22% said there was a good chance they would vote for Edwards. Long-standing partisan differences in attitudes about political compromise are reflected in views of important qualities for presidential candidates. Overall, 52% of registered voters say it is more important for a presidential candidate to compromise with the other party; 42% say it is more important that a candidate sticks to their core values and positions. By roughly two-to-one (63% to 31%), Democratic voters value a candidate who compromises. Republican voters, by 57% to 35%, prefer someone who adheres to core values and positions. In recent years, Democrats have been consistently more likely than Republicans to prefer elected officials who make compromises. (For a recent example, see our post-election survey, conducted after the GOP’s midterm victories.) Large majorities of both liberal Democratic voters (66%), and conservative and moderate Democratic voters (60%), say it is more important for a candidate to compromise than to stick to core positions. Republican voters are internally divided: 64% of conservative Republicans say it is more important for a candidate to stick to core values; just 30% prefer a candidate who makes compromises. Moderate and liberal Republican voters are split (44% stick to core values, 45% compromise). There also are differences among GOP voters based on candidate preferences. Among all Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters, those who say there is a good chance they will vote for Jeb Bush are divided over whether it is more important for a candidate to stick to core positions (48%) or compromise with the other party (46%). Majorities of those who say there is a good chance they will vote for Ted Cruz (75%), Scott Walker (69%), Rand Paul (68%), Ben Carson (66%), Mike Huckabee (61%) and Marco Rubio (58%) say it is more important for a candidate to stick to their positions than to compromise. Republican and Democratic voters also differ over whether it is more important for a presidential candidate to have experience and a proven record or new ideas and a different approach. In general, more GOP voters prefer a candidate who has experience (59%) to one who has news ideas and different approach (33%). Among Democrats, nearly identical percentages value new ideas (48%) and experience (46%). Age is a bigger factor than partisanship in opinions about the relative importance of experience and new ideas. Voters younger than 30 are the only age group to prefer a candidate with new ideas (56% say this, while 38% say they would prefer a candidate with experience and a proven record). There is little variance in these views among Democratic voters who express a good chance of voting for different candidates. For example, about half (47%) of those who see a good chance of voting for Hillary Clinton value experience over new ideas, as do 50% of those who say there would be a good chance of supporting Elizabeth Warren and 45% of those who see a good chance of voting for Joe Biden. Barack Obama’s approval rating remains divided, with 46% approving of his job performance and 47% disapproving of it. Obama’s approval rating is little changed since the start of the year. But through much of 2014, Obama’s job rating hovered around 44%. As has been the case for much of his presidency, Obama’s personal favorability ratings are somewhat more positive than views of his job performance. In the current poll, a somewhat greater share (51%) have a favorable opinion of Obama than approve of his job performance. The public’s views of Congress continue to hover near all-time lows. Just 22% have a favorable opinion of Congress — equal to its rating last December — while 72% feel unfavorably about Congress. The share giving Congress a positive rating dropped below 30% in March 2010 – coinciding with the passage of the Affordable Care Act — and has remained there nearly every survey since. With the GOP now in control of both houses of Congress, Republicans’ views of the institution are only slightly more positive than Democrats’: 29% of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Congress, compared with 22% of Democrats (and 19% of independents). About half of the public (51%) express unfavorable views of Speaker of the House John Boehner, while 22% have a favorable opinion of him (26% hold no opinion). A smaller share of the public has an opinion of Senate Majority Leader McConnell; however, about as many rate him favorably as Boehner (23%) and fewer (38%) have an unfavorable opinion of him (39% have no opinion). In a Pew Research survey last December, the Democratic congressional leaders also received negative ratings. Nearly half of the public (47%) had an unfavorable view of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and 27% were favorable, though Democrats rated her positively on balance. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who recently announced his upcoming retirement, was rated unfavorably by 41% of the public and favorably by 20%. In a change from late 2014, Boehner’s ratings among Republicans and Republican leaners are now more unfavorable (43%) than favorable (34%). Republicans and leaners had rated him either positively or about even in eight previous Pew Research Center surveys since the Republicans won back the House in November 2010.","Today , Democrats , Republicans , and independents are about equally likely to say they have given thought to 2016 candidates .

Passel Senior Demographer Pew Research Center Washington, DC March 26, 2015 Chairman Johnson, Ranking member Carper and members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to testify at this hearing about estimates of the numbers and trends of unauthorized immigrants, their distribution across states and their role in the labor force. I am appearing as the principal author of several recent Pew Research Center reports on these topics. The Pew Research Center does not take positions on policy issues. We are a nonpartisan “fact tank” that generates information we hope will be of value to policymakers. My testimony today summarizes some of the key findings of our research. In my written statement, I will cover a range of research findings about unauthorized immigrants: I start with national and state trends in the size and growth of the unauthorized immigrant population. These trends are analyzed with regard to the national origins of the unauthorized immigrants, focusing on those from Mexico. Then I turn to a discussion of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. labor force and changing patterns over time. Finally, I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants are represented with a discussion of differences across the states. This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last November (Passel and Cohn, 2014) and a new report we are releasing today (Passel and Cohn, 2015). The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990. After 2007, the trend changed abruptly and the numbers dropped dramatically by about 1 million over the next two years to 11.3 million in 2009 as the number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving plummeted and large numbers left the country. Since 2009, the national unauthorized immigrant population has remained essentially unchanged as arrivals and departures have come into rough balance. (See Figure 1.) From 1990 to 2007, the number of unauthorized immigrants increased in every state, but growth was slower in the six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations than in the rest of the nation as a whole. California, the state with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in all years, experienced the largest numerical growth, but its 88% increase from 1990 to 2007 was slower than that of other large states and nearly all smaller states. As a group, the other five largest states (Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas) experienced growth in their unauthorized immigrant population at the national average of 250% over the period. Meanwhile, the unauthorized immigrant population in the rest of the country increased almost sevenfold, from 700,000 in 1990 to 4.7 million in 2007. These growth differentials led to a marked shift in the distribution of unauthorized immigrants across the country. The share in California dropped to 23% in 2007 from 42% in 1990. The share in the other five large states was unchanged at 38%, but the share in the rest of the country essentially doubled, to 39% in 2007 from 20% in 1990. With the overall decreases in the unauthorized immigrant population since 2007, these shifts came to a halt. The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population has leveled off nationally after the Great Recession, but state trends have been more volatile. From 2009 to 2012, according to recent Pew Research Center estimates, the population of unauthorized immigrants rose in seven states and fell in 14.1 Five East Coast states were among those where the number of unauthorized immigrants grew from 2009 to 2012—Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Numbers also rose in Idaho and Nebraska, according to the center’s estimates. (See Map 1.) Six Western states are among those with declines in unauthorized immigrant populations from 2009 to 2012—Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon. Other states with decreases over that period are in the South (Alabama, Georgia and Kentucky), the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana and Kansas) and the Northeast (Massachusetts and New York). The differential growth across states is related to patterns of change in Mexican and non-Mexican unauthorized immigrant populations. According to a Pew Research analysis, the losses in 13 of the 14 states were due to drops in the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico, who make up the majority of unauthorized immigrants. The exception was Massachusetts, where the overall decrease was due to a decline in the number of unauthorized immigrants from other countries. In six of the seven states where populations of unauthorized immigrants grew from 2009 to 2012, it was because the number of non-Mexicans increased; the number of Mexicans declined or did not change. The exception was Nebraska, which had a small but statistically significant increase in Mexican unauthorized immigrants in those years. There is wide variety in state populations of unauthorized immigrants, according to the Pew Research estimates. More than half the 2012 unauthorized immigrant population (60%) lived in the six states with the largest numbers of such immigrants—California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. At the opposite end, six states (Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia), had fewer than 5,000 unauthorized immigrants each in 2012. Unauthorized immigrants accounted for 3.5% of the 2012 U.S. population of nearly 316 million and 26% of the nation’s 42.5 million foreign-born residents, according to the center’s estimates. Both shares were larger in 2007, the peak year for the nation’s unauthorized immigrant population, at 4.0% and 30%, respectively. Most of the states with the largest numbers of unauthorized immigrants also have relatively high shares of unauthorized immigrants. The six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations—California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas—are among the states with the 10 highest shares of unauthorized immigrants in their overall populations. (In addition to these six states, Nevada, where unauthorized immigrants account for 7.6% of the population, ranks first; Arizona, at 4.6%, is sixth; Maryland, 4.3%, is seventh; and Georgia, 3.9%, is eighth.) Similarly, states with relatively lower numbers of unauthorized immigrants tend to have lower shares in the overall population; in 27 states, unauthorized immigrants make up less than 2.5% of the population. (For all states, estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population, the number in the labor force, and their share of the total population and labor force can be found in Appendix Table A1.) In addition to unauthorized immigrants, the nation’s foreign-born population of 42.5 million people in 2012 consisted of 11.7 million legal permanent residents, 17.8 million naturalized citizens and 1.9 million legal residents with temporary status (including students, diplomats and “high-tech guest workers”). Mexicans are a majority of unauthorized immigrants (52% in 2012), but both their numbers and share have declined in recent years, according to Pew Research estimates. Although the U.S. population of unauthorized immigrants was stable from 2009 to 2012, the number of Mexicans in this population fell by about half a million people during those years. According to the Pew Research Center estimates, there were 5.9 million Mexican unauthorized immigrants in 2012, compared with 6.4 million in 2009 and 6.9 million in 2007. (See Figure A1 in Appendix A.) The decline likely resulted from both an increase in departures to Mexico and a decrease in arrivals from Mexico (Passel, Cohn and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2012). After top-ranked Mexico, there is a large drop in the numbers of unauthorized immigrants from other specific countries. El Salvador, with 675,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2012, is the second-largest source. It is followed by Guatemala (525,000), India (450,000), Honduras (350,000), China (300,000) and the Philippines (200,000). Rounding out the top 10 in 2012 are Korea (180,000), the Dominican Republic (170,000) and Colombia (150,000). As the Mexican numbers continued to drop between 2009 and 2012, unauthorized immigrant populations from South America and from a grouping of Europe and Canada held steady. Unauthorized immigrant populations from Asia, the Caribbean, Central America and the rest of the world grew slightly from 2009 to 2012. Among the 44 states (and District of Columbia) for which data about national origin are available,2 Mexicans make up the majority of all unauthorized immigrants in 26 of them. The four states where Mexicans make up more than eight-in-ten unauthorized immigrants are all in the West—New Mexico (89%), Arizona (84%), Idaho (83%) and Wyoming (82%). States with low shares of Mexicans include some in the Northeast: New Hampshire (7%), Rhode Island (6%) and Massachusetts (3%). Hawaii’s share was 7%. Even in states where Mexicans are not the majority of unauthorized immigrants, they are frequently the largest national origin group—36 states have more Mexicans than any other unauthorized immigrants. Mexicans are not the largest group in three New England states—New Hampshire, where India is the largest birth country; Massachusetts with El Salvador; and Rhode Island where Guatemala is the largest. In the area around the nation’s capital (the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia), unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador constitute the largest group. Hondurans outnumber Mexicans in Louisiana. In Alaska and Hawaii, unauthorized immigrants from the Philippines are the largest group, representing a majority of Alaska’s unauthorized immigrant population and almost half of Hawaii’s. The 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were working or looking for work in 2012 made up 5.1% of the labor force or about one-in-twenty U.S. workers. Both of those estimates are unchanged from 2009. The number in the labor force has remained between 8.1 million and 8.3 million since 2007. (See Figure A2 in Appendix A.) The share of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce peaked in 2007, at 5.4%. The share is markedly higher in some states, especially those with high shares of unauthorized immigrants in the population. Among adults ages 16 and older who are working or looking for work, unauthorized immigrants represent the highest share in Nevada (10.2% in 2012); Nevada also has the highest share of unauthorized immigrants in the overall population (7.6%). The share in the labor force also is relatively high in California (9.4%) and Texas (8.9%), which rank second and third in the unauthorized immigrant share of the total population. (Appendix Table A1 shows the number and share of unauthorized immigrants in the labor force for each state.) Unauthorized immigrants are more likely than the overall U.S. population to be of working age and less likely to be young or older (Passel and Cohn, 2009). That is one reason that the unauthorized immigrant share of the labor force is higher than its share of the population overall. Unauthorized immigrants of working age have substantially different patterns of labor force participation than do people born in the U.S. Unauthorized immigrant men of working age are considerably more likely to be in the workforce than U.S.-born men (91% versus 79%). For women, the opposite is true; only 61% of unauthorized immigrant women are in the labor force, compared with 72% of U.S.-born women. For both genders, substantial portions of the U.S.-born population of working age are not in the labor force because they are attending school, retired or disabled, but that is true for only a small share of unauthorized immigrants. A major difference for women is that a higher share of unauthorized immigrant women say they are not working and have young children at home (22%) compared with other immigrants (13%) and U.S.-born women (7%). While there have been some modest changes in labor force participation rates over the past 20 years, the participation of unauthorized immigrant men and women, relative to the U.S.-born population and legal immigrants, has remained essentially unchanged since 2005. Because unauthorized immigrants tend to have less education than people born in the U.S. or legal immigrants, they are more likely to hold low-skilled jobs and less likely to be in white-collar occupations; further, their status limits job opportunities. Consequently, unauthorized immigrants tend to be overrepresented in certain sectors of the economy. Of all unauthorized immigrant workers, 22% are in services (professional, business and other3), 18% in the leisure and hospitality sector and 16% in construction (Table 1). These three industry sectors encompass 55% of unauthorized workers but only 31% of U.S.-born workers. Manufacturing (13%) and agriculture (5%) also have relatively large shares of the unauthorized immigrant workforce. (Data on the composition of all major industries are shown in Appendix Table A8.) Looked at using another metric—the unauthorized-immigrant share of the total workforce—it becomes clear that they are particularly concentrated in some subsets of each major industry. In 2012, they represented 24% of workers in the landscaping industry, 23% of those in private household employment, 20% of those in apparel manufacturing, 20% in crop production, 19% in the dry cleaning and laundry industry and 19% of those in building maintenance. These figures are much larger than unauthorized immigrants’ share of the overall workforce—5.1%. (Figure 4 below shows major industry concentrations. A more extensive listing of detailed industries is shown in Appendix Table A7.) The industry concentrations of unauthorized immigrants vary across the states, depending, in part, on the countries of origin of the immigrants and the nature of each state’s economy. We produced estimates of the number of unauthorized immigrant workers by industry in 43 states and the District of Columbia where there are enough unauthorized immigrants in the workforce to provide reliable data. The leisure and hospitality industry has the most unauthorized immigrant workers in 14 states and the District of Columbia, construction does in 11 states and manufacturing does in 11 states. The states where leisure and hospitality is the largest sector for unauthorized immigrants tend to be in the West or Northeast (plus, not surprisingly, Florida). The states where manufacturing is the largest tend to be in the Midwest, and the construction-dominated states tend to be in the South. (Appendix Table A2 shows the largest three major industries in each state together with the share of the state’s unauthorized immigrant workers in the industry.) Looked at another way—using the unauthorized-immigrant share of each industry’s workforce—the picture of industry concentration changes somewhat. In almost half of the states (21 of 43), agriculture is the industry with the largest share of total workers who are unauthorized immigrants; in 10 other states, agriculture is the industry with the second largest share who are unauthorized immigrants. These 31 states are spread in all regions of the country. The agriculture industry ranks first in this regard in every Western state for which data are available, except Alaska and Nevada; in Nevada, it ranks second. The construction industry is also one where the share of workers who are unauthorized immigrants tends to be large (first in 10 states and the District of Columbia, second in 15 and third in nine). As with numbers of unauthorized immigrant workers, the states where the construction industry workforce has the largest share of unauthorized immigrants tend to be in the South. (Appendix Table A4 shows the three major industries in each state that have the largest shares of their workers who are unauthorized immigrants.) Industry classifications tend to contain occupations requiring a range of education levels, whereas occupation classifications tend to include jobs requiring similar skill levels or certifications. Because unauthorized immigrants tend to cluster in low-skilled jobs, they tend to be even more concentrated in specific occupation groups than in specific industries. Among unauthorized immigrants in the labor force, 33% are service workers, 15% are construction workers and 14% are production and installation workers. Almost two-thirds (62%) of unauthorized immigrant workers have occupations in these three broad categories; by contrast, only half that share (31%) of U.S.-born workers have such occupations. (See Table 2. Appendix Table A9 has data on the composition of all major occupation groups.) Because they are so concentrated in certain major occupation groups, unauthorized immigrants are a high proportion of workers in some more detailed categories. For example, 26% of farmworkers are unauthorized immigrants, as are 17% of building, groundskeeping and maintenance workers, and 14% of construction workers. Unauthorized immigrants also are overrepresented as a share of food preparation workers and servers (11%), production workers (9%) and transportation and material moving workers (7%) compared with their overall presence in the labor force. Within these categories, there are some specific, detailed occupations where unauthorized immigrants are even more highly concentrated. They are especially likely to hold certain low-skilled jobs in construction and service categories. For example, unauthorized immigrants are about one-third of drywall installers (34%) and farm laborers (30%). They represent about one-quarter of roofers (27%), maids (25%), painters (24%), masons (22%) and carpet and floor installers (22%). (See Appendix Table A6 for other detailed occupations with high shares of unauthorized immigrants.) At the state level, there is much less diversity in broad occupation groups than in broad industry groups. In 39 of 43 states and in the District of Columbia, service occupations account for the largest number (and share) of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce. Construction and production occupations also have large shares across many states, but these groups tend to have fewer unauthorized immigrant workers than service occupations. (Appendix Table A3 shows the top three major occupation groups in terms of the number of unauthorized immigrants together with their share of unauthorized workers in the state.) Again, the picture changes when we examine the occupation groups where unauthorized immigrants make up the largest share of workers in the group. In 34 states, the occupation group with the highest proportion of workers who are unauthorized immigrants is farming, fishing and forestry (i.e., agriculture). This occupation group’s total workforce has the highest share consisting of unauthorized immigrants nationally (26%). But because agriculture employs less than 1 percent of the U.S. workforce, there are very few states where these agricultural occupations represent a significant share of the unauthorized immigrant workforce. Construction jobs tend to have high shares of unauthorized immigrant workers. This occupation’s workforce has the highest share of unauthorized immigrants in six states and the District of Columbia, the second highest in 24 and the third highest in another five. Service occupations and production occupations tend to have relatively high shares of workers who are unauthorized immigrants, but at levels somewhat below agriculture and construction occupations. (Appendix Table A5 has the top three major occupation groups with the largest share of their workers who are unauthorized immigrants.)","States with low shares of Mexicans include some in the Northeast : New Hampshire ( 7 % ) , Rhode Island ( 6 % ) and Massachusetts ( 3 % ) .

On the one hand, this group, which makes up half of the adult U.S. Hispanic population, is less likely than other Americans to have ever visited a U.S. public library and is much less likely to say that they see it as “very easy” to do so. At the same time, Hispanic immigrants who have made their way to a public library stand out as the most appreciative of what libraries have to offer, from free books to research resources to the fact that libraries tend to offer a quiet, safe space. And they are more likely than other groups to say that closing their community library would have a major impact on their family. These are some of the findings of this latest installment of the Pew Research Center’s reporting on the Center’s landmark 2013 Library Services Survey. Seven-in-ten \t\t(72%) Latinos ages 16 and older say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person at one point or another in their lives,  \t\t the survey shows, a share below that of whites (83%) and blacks (80%). But this finding masks a large difference among Latinos. Fully \t\t83% of U.S.-born Latinos say they have visited a public library at some point in their lives—a share similar to that of whites and blacks. However, among immigrant Latinos, a smaller share—60%—say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person. Some public library services can also be accessed remotely through library websites. Here, too, though, the survey finds a gap in use between U.S.-born Latinos (49%), blacks (48%) and whites (45%) who say they have accessed a public library website and immigrant Latinos (27%) who say the same. This gap in use between foreign-born Hispanics and U.S.-born Hispanics, whites and blacks may reflect foreign-born Hispanics’ views of the relative ease of using public libraries. According to the survey, \t\tjust one-third of immigrant Hispanics say they would find it “very easy” to visit a public library in person if they wanted to do so.  \t\t By comparison, 60% of U.S.-born Hispanics, 67% of whites and 59% of blacks say it would be very easy to visit a public library in person. One reason immigrant Hispanics may find public libraries more difficult to use is their language use or skills—more than half are Spanish-dominant, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys of Hispanics.1 As a result, the availability of Spanish-language materials at public libraries may be a reason, though the 2013 library survey did not ask about either measure. When it comes to using public library websites, 24% of immigrant Hispanics say this would be “very easy” to do so, a share below that of U.S.-born Hispanics (42%), whites (51%) and blacks (47%) who same the same. This difference in use between foreign-born Latinos and U.S.-born Latinos, whites and blacks may reflect the gap in internet access between immigrant Latinos and others. According to the 2013 Library Services Survey, 75% of immigrant Latinos use the internet while 92% of U.S.-born Latinos, 87% of whites and 81% of blacks are internet users.2 There are more than 17,000 public libraries and bookmobiles nationwide, which together serve 96% of the U.S. population. In fiscal year 2010, libraries circulated some 2.5 billion materials, which include books along with many other materials such as DVDs and e-books (Swan et al., 2013). But public libraries have seen their role shift as they also become a community center and hub for technology (Zickuhr, Rainie and Purcell, 2013), offering a range of services for their users. The Pew Research library survey finds that among library users, that is, those who have ever used a public library, Hispanics are less likely than whites or blacks to know about the services offered by their local library. Six-in-ten (62%) Hispanic library users say they know about at least some of the library services their local public library offers. By comparison, 71% of white and 74% of black library users say the same about their public libraries. Nonetheless, Latinos who have ever used a library or have household members who have done so are more likely than whites to say that services libraries offer beyond book lending are important. This is especially true among immigrant Latinos, who are as much as three times as likely as whites to say this. For example, among library users, 85% of immigrant Latinos say that offering a quiet, safe place to spend time, read or study is a “very important” service offered by public libraries for themselves and their families. By contrast, 60% of U.S.-born Latinos, 71% of blacks and 43% of whites say the same. The gap between immigrant Latinos and whites is largest on services such as help finding and applying for a job and help applying for government programs, permits or licenses. Two-thirds (68%) of immigrant Latinos say each of these library services is very important for themselves and their families. Among whites, just 20% say the same about each service. Perhaps because of the importance of library services for Latino library patrons, Latinos overall are more likely than whites or blacks to say library closings would have a major impact on themselves and their families. Among those ages 16 and older, 40% of Latinos say this, compared with 26% of whites and 32% of blacks. But here, too, \t\tthe difference is driven entirely by foreign-born Latinos, half of whom say library closings would have a major impact on themselves and their families,  \t\t while U.S.-born Latinos’ response is much more like the rest of the population (29% say that the closing of their local public library would have a major impact on their family). When it comes to the impact the closing of their local public library would have on their community, two-thirds (65%) of Hispanics say the impact would be a major one, a similar share to that of whites (63%) and blacks (64%). However, immigrant Hispanics are the most likely to see an impact on their community. Some 73% say this, compared with 58% of U.S.-born Hispanics.3 Overall, Hispanics have strongly positive feelings about the role of libraries in their communities, just as other Americans do. However, Hispanics are more likely than others to say that public libraries are becoming obsolete as a tool for finding information. For example, eight-in-ten (80%) Hispanics “strongly agree” that libraries are important because they promote literacy and a love of reading, a share similar to that of blacks (83%), and somewhat higher than that of whites (76%), who say the same. All three groups also strongly agree that public libraries play an important role in giving everyone a chance to succeed because they provide free access to materials and resources, though again the share is somewhat higher among Hispanics (75%) and blacks (77%) than it is among whites (70%). And 71% of Hispanics, 69% of whites and 73% of blacks strongly agree that public libraries improve the quality of life in a community. Among Latinos, there are some differences between the U.S. born and immigrants in their views of the roles of public libraries. For example, while 44% of U.S.-born Latinos strongly agree that libraries provide many services hard to find elsewhere (a share similar to the 47% of whites who say the same), 63% of immigrant Latinos express the same views. When it comes to whether public libraries improve the quality of life in a community, 77% of immigrant Latinos strongly agree that they do, while 65% of U.S.-born Latinos strong agree. However, views about public libraries are not always positive among foreign-born Latinos—43% strongly agree that public libraries are not needed as much as they used to be because information can be found elsewhere. By contrast, 27% of U.S.-born Latinos say the same about public libraries, as do 21% of blacks and 19% of whites. The nation’s Hispanic population is its largest minority group. Today more than 54 million Hispanics live in the U.S., making up 17% of all Americans (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). Hispanics are also younger than other groups. Among Hispanics the median age is 27 years, which drops to 18 years among U.S.-born Hispanics (Brown and Patten, 2014). By comparison, the median age for non-Hispanic whites is 42 years. These findings are based on a nationally representative survey of 6,224 Americans ages 16 and older, including 739 Hispanics. It was fielded July 18-Sept. 30, 2013 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in English and Spanish on landline and cellular phones. The margin of error for the Hispanics sample is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

And as a new Pew Research Center survey highlights, the gap between rich and poor is seen as a major problem among all the publics polled in 44 nations across the globe. However, we found that people in the emerging and developing world are optimistic about the financial future of their children. It’s a different story in richer nations, where most believe prospects for the next generation are grim. Here are five key takeaways from a new Pew Research report on what the world thinks about opportunity and inequality. 1There is widespread pessimism in rich countries, with many saying that today’s young people will do worse economically than the generation that came before. Across the 10 economically advanced nations surveyed, a median of 65% believe that when children in their country grow up, they will be financially worse off than their parents. In the U.S., 65% say American children will be worse off, while just 30% think they will do better financially than their parents. 2A major reason why emerging and developing nations are more optimistic is that their economies have performed better in recent years. Overall, there is a strong relationship between economic growth and optimism for the next generation. People in countries that have had strong growth since 2008 – such as China, Vietnam and Ghana – are much more likely to say today’s children will be better off than their parents. In nations hit hard by the Great Recession – such as Greece, Spain and Italy – there is much less optimism. 3Across the globe, there is widespread support for free markets. Even though many people worry about the gap between rich and poor, majorities across the globe are willing to accept some inequality to have a free market system. A global median of 66% say most people are better off under capitalism, even if some people are rich and some are poor. Confidence in the free market system is especially strong in developing nations. 4Global publics agree that education is a key to success. When asked to rate, on a scale of 0-10, how important a good education is to getting ahead in life, a median of 60% across the 44 countries surveyed said “10.” None of the other factors tested – hard work, knowing the right people, luck, belonging to a wealthy family, being male or giving bribes – rated as highly. 5Individualism is often considered a central feature of American identity, and the survey highlights some of the ways in which Americans are more individualistic than many others around the world. For instance, Americans are especially likely to believe that hard work is a key to success and to think that success in life is not determined by forces beyond our control.","There is widespread pessimism in rich countries , with many saying that today ’s young people will do worse economically than the generation that came before .

By a margin of 70%-9%, Americans say most journalists want to see Obama, not John McCain, win on Nov. 4. Another 8% say journalists don’t favor either candidate, and 13% say they don’t know which candidate most reporters support. A separate study released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism looks at the media’s recent campaign coverage and finds that McCain received significantly more negative than positive coverage between the GOP convention and the final debate. The study says that press treatment of Obama has been somewhat more positive than negative, but not markedly so. [See “Winning the Media Campaign” released October 22, 2008.] In recent presidential campaigns, voters repeatedly have said they thought journalists favored the Democratic candidate over the Republican. But this year’s margin is particularly wide. At this stage of the 2004 campaign, 50% of voters said most journalists wanted to see John Kerry win the election, while 22% said most journalists favored George Bush. In October 2000, 47% of voters said journalists wanted to see Al Gore win and 23% said most journalists wanted Bush to win. In 1996, 59% said journalists were pulling for Bill Clinton. In the current campaign, Republicans, Democrats and independents all feel that the media wants to see Obama win the election. Republicans are almost unanimous in their opinion: 90% of GOP voters say most journalists are pulling for Obama. More than six-in-ten Democratic and independent voters (62% each) say the same. The latest Pew weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted October 17-20, shows that changing opinions of Obama have been more favorable than unfavorable in these waning days of the campaign, while just the opposite is true for changing views of McCain. A third of the public (33%) says their opinion of Obama has become more favorable in recent days, while 23% say their opinion of the Democratic nominee has become less favorable. By contrast, 34% say their opinion of McCain has become less favorable in recent days and 24% say their opinion of the GOP nominee has become more favorable. Changing views of McCain’s running mate are also more negative than positive: 35% say their opinion of Sarah Palin has become less favorable in recent days, while only 21% say their view of Palin has become more favorable. Views of Joe Biden have remained relatively stable. Most Americans (57%) say their opinion of Biden hasn’t changed recently. Over the past two months, the public has become much more familiar with the presidential candidates and their issue positions. Solid majorities now say they know at least a fair amount about John McCain’s positions on foreign policy and the economy. Similarly, a large majority say they know about Obama’s positions on the economy and most say they know about his foreign policy views. With so much attention on the international financial crisis in recent weeks, awareness of the candidates’ economic positions has increased most dramatically. In August, 56% said they knew a lot or a fair amount about Obama’s positions on the economy; today 73% say they know as much about where the Democratic nominee stands on the economy. Nearly as many (69%) now say they know a lot or a great deal about McCain’s economic positions, up from 54% in August. On foreign policy, a solid majority (64%) now says they know at least a fair amount about McCain’s positions, up from 54% in August. While awareness of Obama’s foreign policy positions also has increased, the Democrat still lags behind McCain on this measure. Today 58% say they know a lot or a great deal about Obama’s views on foreign policy (up from 48% in August). Republicans are more aware than Democrats of McCain’s policy positions, while Democrats know more than Republicans about where Obama stands on the issues. Independents say they know the two candidates’ economic policies equally well. Seven-in-ten say they know at least a fair amount about Obama’s economic policies, while 68% say the same of McCain’s. However, while 62% of independents know at least a far amount about McCain’s foreign policy positions, only 52% say they know as much about where Obama stands on foreign policy. The public also knows a good deal about the personal history of the candidates. More than three-quarters (78%) say they know a lot or a fair amount about McCain’s background and qualifications, and nearly as many (73%) say they know at least a fair amount about Obama’s background. The public’s appetite for presidential campaign news reached an all time high last week as Obama and McCain faced off in their third and final debate. Fully, 61% of Americans reported following news about the campaign very closely and another three-in-ten (28%) were following the race fairly closely. The campaign attracted significantly more attention than the previous week, when roughly half (52%) followed election news very closely. For its part, the national media devoted more newshole the campaign (51% of all coverage) than to any other story, including the nation’s financial crisis, according to the News Coverage Index conducted by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). The level of public interest in the campaign for mid-October is significantly higher than at the same point in 2004 (56% now vs. 46% then). An analysis comparing the last two News Interest Index surveys (conducted Oct. 10-13 and Oct. 17-20) with results from mid-October 2004 finds that interest in the campaign is up among many subgroups. There is much higher interest this year among African Americans (up 24 points), those with a high school degree or less education (up 18 points), Democrats (up 17 points) and those 65 years and older (up 16 points). Meanwhile, the percent of Republicans following campaign news very closely is the same (57%) as it was at this point in 2004. John McCain introduced a new character into the campaign dialogue last week, when during the presidential debate he repeatedly cited “Joe the plumber,” an Ohio man who had confronted Obama on the trail about his tax proposals. Almost two-thirds (64%) of the public heard a lot about “Joe the plumber” and another one-in-four heard a little about him. Discussions tied to “Joe” made for one of the most widely heard about events of the campaign, comparable to the percentage who heard a lot about McCain’s decision to temporarily suspend his campaign last month (65%) and Obama’s visit to the Middle East and Europe in late July (62%). According to PEJ’s Campaign Coverage Index, “Joe the plumber” was the third biggest campaign storyline last week, accounting for 8% of all campaign related news. Fewer Americans have heard a lot about Obama’s ties to ACORN, the community organizing group that has been accused of voter registration fraud. Still, roughly half (48%) have heard a lot about ACORN and ties to Obama and a third (34%) have heard a little about this story. A solid majority of Republicans (60%) have heard a lot about ACORN, compared with fewer than half of Democrats (46%) and independents (43%). Just under one-in-four (23%) heard a lot about McCain’s appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman and another 41% heard a little about this. More Democrats (30%) than Republicans (19%) reported hearing a lot about McCain on the Letterman show. A substantial majority of Americans (80%) tuned in to at least some portion of the presidential debate coverage. Only 20% say they didn’t watch any coverage of the three televised debates. By a more than three-to-one margin (66%-21%), those who watched the debates say Obama did a better job than McCain. Democrats overwhelmingly believe their nominee prevailed in the debates. About nine-in-ten (92%) of Democrats who watched the debates say Obama did the better job, while only 4% say McCain gave a stronger performance. While a plurality of Republicans (47%) say McCain won the debates, nearly a third (31%) say Obama did a better job. Among independents, 71% say Obama gave the better debate performance; only 18% choose McCain. The public has a positive impression of the presidential debates overall. Fully 77% of those who watched at least a little of the debate coverage say the debates were interesting. Nearly as many (70%) say they were informative. Views are more mixed with regard to how entertaining the debates were – 49% say they were entertaining, 50% say they were not. While Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to have watched the debates, Democrats reacted more positively to them. Fully 81% of Democrats say the debates were informative, but only 59% of Republicans agree. Similarly, 86% of Democrats found the debates to be interesting, compared with 71% of Republicans. A majority of Democrats (55%) found the debates entertaining; 48% of Republicans did as well. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collecte d from October 13-19 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected October 17-20 from a nationally representative sample of 1,003 adults. In addition to following campaign news last week, the public continued to closely track news about the economy. Fully 62% followed reports about the U.S. economy very closely and 54% paid very close attention to recent major ups and downs in the U.S. stock market. When asked to name the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week, 42% of the public listed either reports about the economy (24%) or changes in the stock market (18%). In addition, many Americans were following news about the falling price of gas and oil – 53% followed this story very closely and 11% listed this as their most closely followed news story of the week. With 38% of the public saying the presidential campaign was their most closely followed story last week, interest in economic news just edged out interest in the election. At the same time, the media clearly shifted its focus away from the economic crisis and back to the campaign. According to the Pew’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, 51% of the national newshole last week was devoted to the presidential campaign, while 23% of the newshole focused on the economy. Cable television news focused heavily on the campaign, with 80% of its coverage going to election news and only 12% to economic news. Relatively few Americans paid close attention to news about the California wildfires last week: 15% followed this story very closely and 2% listed this as their most closely followed story. News that Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie are divorcing attracted very little public attention. Only 3% of the public followed this story very closely, while 70% said they weren’t following it all. The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public’s interest in and reaction to major news events. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, an ongoing content analysis of the news. The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media: newspapers, network television, cable television, radio and the internet. Each week (from Sunday through Friday) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week. The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week. Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, conducted under the direction of ORC (Opinion Research Corporation). For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls, and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error.

Over a year after protests rocked Istanbul and other major cities in Turkey, the survey also finds many Turks disapprove of Erdogan’s handling of them. The anti-government demonstrations were in response to plans to build Ottoman-style military barracks with a shopping mall and luxury hotels within Gezi Park, a popular green space in Istanbul. In Turkey, only about half (51%) have a positive view of their prime minister, down 11 percentage points from 2013. In all, 55% disapprove of his handling of Gezi Park protests, while just 37% approve. Despite all this, Erdogan is a heavy favorite going into next month’s presidential election because of strong support from his dominant Justice and Development Party (AKP) and a long record of economic growth in Turkey. Amid continued unrest in Syria, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories, support for Erdogan has dropped significantly in four of the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed since last year. For example, last year, 75% in Jordan had a favorable view of Erdogan, but in the current poll it is only 60%. Support dropped even further in Egypt (-26 points). Turkey had been a strong supporter of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and his now outlawed Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. Opinions of Erdogan have held relatively steady in Tunisia and Lebanon since last year. In Lebanon, Erdogan’s support is bolstered by Sunni Muslims (76% favorable) and Christians (58%). Erdogan himself is a Sunni Muslim, as are the majority of Muslims in Turkey. Only one-in-ten Lebanese Shia Muslims have a positive view of him. In Israel, 16% have a positive opinion of Erdogan. This includes only 8% of Israeli Jews. On the other hand, 62% of Israeli Arabs have a favorable impression of Turkey’s leader. Turkish-Israeli relations have been strained in recent years by a 2010 raid on a flotilla trying to bring aid to Gaza and Turkey’s increasing support for Palestinian statehood. Still, support for Erdogan has also dropped in the Palestinian territories since 2013 (-19 points). Here are the topline results and survey methodology.","With a presidential election just over a week away , a new survey finds that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s support has declined sharply in his home country and around the Middle East .

Board of Education decision, holding that racial segregation in public schools violated the Constitution. But while schools have become more integrated, in part due to broad demographic trends, white students remain significantly less likely than minorities to attend diverse schools, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Education data by the Pew Research Center. In 2010, some 15.9% of whites attended a school where minorities made up at least half of all students. By comparison, more than three-quarters of Hispanics and blacks (and six-in-ten Asians) attended these “majority-minority” schools. White students, while still a majority in the nation’s public school classrooms, have shrunk in number. From 1990 to 2010, the number of white students decreased by 2.1 million. Meanwhile, the number of black, Hispanic and Asian students in those schools has increased by 8.9 million. White students in 2012 made up 51% of public school students, down from 68% in 1990. Fueled by these demographic trends, the share of white students enrolled in majority-minority schools has nearly doubled over the past two decades, from 8.4% in 1990 to 15.9% in 2010. The share of black, Hispanic and Asian students enrolled in majority-minority schools also increased during this time—for Hispanics, from 73% to 79%, for example. White students are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to attend school where a vast majority of students are of the same race or ethnicity. In 2006, the most recent year for which data was published, some 62% of white students attended a school where three-quarters or more of all students were white. By comparison, about one-in-three black and Hispanic students attended a school where at least three-quarters of students were of the same race or ethnicity. (Data on Asians was not available.) Among Latino students, segregation has grown most in the western U.S., according to a new report from the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2011, some 45% of Latinos in the West attended schools where at least nine-in-ten students were minorities, up from 29% in 1991. In the Northeast, about 44% of Latinos attended these schools in 2011, down from 47% in 1991. Among blacks, students in the South attend less-segregated schools than those in the Northeast, though segregation in the South has increased in recent decades, according to the report. In 2011, some 34% of blacks in the South attended schools where at least nine-in-ten students were minorities. While that’s up from 26% in 1991, it’s far lower than 78% of students in 1968 that attended “highly segregated” schools. In the Northeast, some 51% of blacks attended highly segregated schools in 2011, a slight increase from twenty years earlier.","Fueled by these demographic trends , the share of white students enrolled in majority - minority schools has nearly doubled over the past two decades , from 8.4 % in 1990 to 15.9 % in 2010 .

Just as support in Congress for the legislation was divided along party lines, there are wide partisan gaps among the public in expectations for the law’s personal and national impact. Within both parties, there are sizable differences based on family incomes. The new survey, conducted Jan. 10-15 among 1,503 adults, finds that 29% say the tax law will have a mostly positive effect on them and their families, while nearly as many (27%) say its effect will be mostly negative. A third say the law will not have much of a personal impact. Opinions also are divided about the tax law’s impact on the country as a whole: 35% say the law will have a mostly positive effect on the country, 40% a mostly negative effect and 15% say it will have little effect. The public’s general views of the tax law are similar to expectations for its long-term impact on the country. Overall, 37% of Americans approve of the law, while 46% disapprove; nearly one-in-five (17%) do not offer an opinion. Partisanship is a major factor in opinions about the tax law, but differences between Republicans and Democrats are much wider regarding the law’s impact on the country (and on overall approval) than on its expected personal impact. About half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (52%) say the tax law will have a mostly positive effect on them and their families in the years to come. Nearly a third (32%) say that it will not have much of an effect, while 7% say the effect will be mostly negative. Just 13% of Democrats and Democratic leaners expect the tax law to have a mostly positive personal impact, while 35% say it will not have much of an impact; 42% say they will be negatively affected in coming years. A large majority of Republicans (71%) say the law will have a mostly positive impact on the country in coming years. And a sizable but narrower majority of Democrats (63%) say its effects will be mostly negative. Assessments of the law over the coming years vary widely by income as well. People with family incomes of $75,000 or more say the tax law’s personal impact will be more positive than negative. Those with lower incomes have less favorable expectations for the law. Nearly four-in-ten (38%) of those with incomes of at least $100,000 say the law will have a mostly positive personal impact, while just 20% expect negative effects (35% say it will not have much effect). Among those with incomes of $75,000-$99,999, 44% say the law’s personal impact will be mostly positive compared with 19% who say it will be mostly negative; 30% expect not much of an effect. Among those with lower incomes – less than $75,000 – only about a quarter say the law will have mostly positive effects for them and their families. And about as many (or more in the case of those with incomes below $40,000) expect mostly negative personal effects. Income differences are more modest in views of the effect of the tax bill on the country as a whole. Among Republicans, in particular, there are sizable income differences in expectations for the law’s personal impact. A majority (62%) of Republicans and Republican leaners with incomes of $75,000 or more say the tax law will have a mostly positive impact on them and their families. That compares with 50% of Republicans with incomes between $40,000 and $74,999 and 43% of those with incomes below $40,000. Majorities of Republicans across income categories say the law will have a mostly positive impact on the country in coming years. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, those with lower family incomes (less than $75,000) are more likely than those with higher incomes to say the law will have mostly negative effects personally. And while majorities of Democrats across income categories say the law will negatively impact the country, this view is more pronounced among those with incomes of $75,000 or more (74% say this) than those with lower incomes (59% of less than $75,000). Most Americans say they feel they understand how the tax law might affect them and their families at least somewhat well: About two-thirds (65%) say this, though just 30% say they understand the law’s impact “very” well. Fewer feel they understand the law “not too well” (18%) or “not at all well” (13%). Overall, personal understanding of the tax law’s impact varies only modestly across demographic groups. However, those with more education feel they understand how the law might affect them better than those with less education. Partisan differences in understanding are modest: Republicans and Republican leaners (71%) are only somewhat more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners (65%) to say they understand very or somewhat well how the law might affect them. Among the majority of the public who say they understand at least somewhat well how the tax law might affect them, expectations of the law’s personal impact are more positive than negative: 37% say it will have a mostly positive effect over the coming years on them and their families while 28% say it will have a mostly negative effect; 32% say it won’t have much effect. Among those who feel less confident in their understanding of the law, 39% say it will not have much an effect on them personally; 27% say its effect will be mostly negative, while 15% say it will be mostly positive. Republicans who feel they understand how the law might affect them and their families at least somewhat well are far more likely than other Republicans to say it will have a positive impact on them, and on the country as a whole. Among Democrats, the balance of opinion about the personal impact of the tax law differs little between those who say they understand the law at least somewhat well and those who do not. But Democrats who say they understand the law are more negative about its impact on the country than those who say they do not have a good understanding of the law. Across most demographic groups, overall assessments of the tax law tilt more negative than positive. Still, there are significant differences in approval by race, age, education and partisanship. Nearly four-in-ten Americans (37%) say they approve of the tax law passed by Trump and Congress, while 46% disapprove; 17% do not offer an opinion of the legislation. While whites are somewhat more likely to approve than disapprove (45% vs. 39%), blacks (66%) and Hispanics (58%) widely disapprove. Young adults are far more likely than those older to disapprove of the tax law: 54% of those under 30 say they disapprove, compared with 39% of those 65 and older. And while those with at least a four-year college degree disapprove by roughly two-to-one margins, those with less education are roughly divided over the tax law. Nearly two-in-ten of those with less education, however, do not offer an opinion on the tax law. Fully three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners say they approve of the tax law, including 57% who approve strongly. Opinion is nearly the reverse among Democrats: 73% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they disapprove, including 58% who disapprove strongly.","The new survey , conducted Jan. 10 - 15 among 1,503 adults , finds that 29 % say the tax law will have a mostly positive effect on them and their families , while nearly as many ( 27 % ) say its effect will be mostly negative .

Fully 46% say they are hearing mostly bad news about the nation’s economy, up nine points since last month and the highest percentage since March 2009. Nearly as many now say they are hearing mostly bad economic news as a mix of good and bad news (46% vs. 50%). As recently as last month, 35% said they were hearing mostly bad economic news while far more (56%) said the news was mixed. The proportion hearing mostly good economic news, which has been in the single digits for most of the past three years, stands at just 2%. The latest News Interest Index survey of 1,006 adults, conducted June 2-5, finds that the economy topped the public’s news interest last week. One-in-five (20%) say the followed economic news most closely, compared with 12% who tracked the war in Afghanistan most closely and 11% each who followed the 2012 presidential candidates and the NBA finals most closely. The economy and the presidential election are the week’s most heavily covered stories, according to a separate analysis by the Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). Reports on the economy accounted for 13% of all news coverage while 12% of coverage was devoted to the campaign. That is the highest percentage of campaign coverage this year, according to PEJ. Overall, one-in-five Americans (20%) say they followed news about the 2012 presidential candidates very closely, a figure that has changed little over the past few months. However, the proportion following news about the candidates most closely – like the share of news coverage devoted to the campaign – is at its highest point this year, at 11%. During a week in which Mitt Romney officially launched his presidential campaign and Sarah Palin embarked on a highly publicized bus tour, both Romney and Palin increased their visibility among the public. Currently, 22% name Mitt Romney as the possible GOP candidate they have been hearing the most about, while 20% name Sarah Palin. Both Romney and Palin were barely on the public’s radar last month. In mid-May (May 12-15), the top two potential GOP candidates in terms of visibility were Donald Trump (16%) and Newt Gingrich (12%). In the new survey, just 5% say they heard the most about Trump and 2% Gingrich. While Palin matches Romney in visibility among the public, far more Republicans name Romney than Palin as the GOP candidate they are hearing the most about (34% to 20%). No other possible GOP candidate comes close. The survey finds that as public’s perceptions of economic news have grown more negative, so have views of news about specific economic sectors – notably jobs, real estate and the financial markets. Currently, 58% say they are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation, up seven points since mid-May and 15 points (from 43%) in early April. Twice as many say they are hearing mostly bad news as mixed news about real estate values (56% to 28%). From March through May, perceptions of news about housing were far less negative; in May, for instance, 45% said they were hearing mostly bad news while 35% said the news was a mix of good and bad. And the proportion saying they are hearing mostly bad news about financial markets (40%) is at its highest point all year. Moreover, the small share hearing mostly good news about financial markets, which stood at 17% in February and 11% last month, has fallen to 5% in the current survey. In contrast to news about other sectors, there has been a sizable decline in the percentage hearing mostly bad news about gas prices – from 84% in May to 68% currently. Still, more say they are hearing mostly negative news about gas prices than any other sector included in the survey. The view that news about the overall economy is mostly bad has increased sharply among more affluent people, as well as older Americans and political independents. Currently, half (50%) of those with family incomes of $75,000 or more say that news about the economy is mostly bad, up from just 31% less than a month ago. Since May, there also has been a 19-point increase in the percentage of those 65 and older who say that economic news is mostly bad (from 35% to 54%). Among those 50 to 64, 50% now see economic news as mostly negative, up from 37% in May. The partisan gap in perceptions of economic news also has widened since last month. Currently, 57% of Republicans say news about the economy is mostly bad, compared with 34% of Democrats. In May, 46% of Republicans and 29% of Democrats viewed economic news negatively. In the new survey, 49% of independents say news about the economy is mostly bad, up from just 33% last month. Independents’ views of economic news, which tracked closer to Democrats’ views in May, are now more similar to Republicans’. Americans followed news about the economy more closely than another other story, with 20% citing this as their top story of the week; 35% say they followed news about the condition of the economy very closely. This is virtually unchanged from recent weeks, but lower than interest from earlier this spring. The economy received more news coverage than any other topic of the week, 13%, according to PEJ. (NOTE: PEJ’s analysis includes coverage of the debt limit debate with news about the economy; total coverage for the two categories was 19%). News about the 2012 elections—including Mitt Romney’s announcement that he would seek the Republican nomination—drew 12% of news coverage, about as much as the economy. About one-in-five (21%) followed news about the 2012 candidates very closely, while 11% say they followed it most closely. Republicans (29%) are more likely than Democrats (20%) or independents (19%) to say they tracked news about the 2012 candidates very closely. Roughly one-in-five also say they followed news about the current situation and events in Afghanistan (20% very closely) and news about anti-government protests and violence in some Middle Eastern countries (18%). However, far more cited news about Afghanistan as their top story than said that about Middle East unrest (12% vs. 4%). Coverage of unrest in the Middle East accounted for 9% of coverage, while news about Afghanistan made up 3% of the newshole. Fewer Americans followed news about the NBA finals very closely (14%), while 11% say it was their top story. Three times as many African Americans as whites followed the basketball finals very closely (33% vs. 10%). In other political news, the debate in Washington over whether to raise the federal debt limit was the top story for just 7% of Americans; 23% of Americans say they followed news about this topic very closely. Debt limit news accounted for 6% of coverage last week, according to PEJ’s analysis. Republicans were the most interested in this story: 33% say they followed debt limit news very closely, while just 21% of independents and 18% of Democrats say the same. Eight-in-ten Americans say they had heard a lot (29%) or a little (52%) about an international health panel warning of a possible link between cell phone use and brain cancer. As is usually the case with health-related stories, women had heard more about this story than had men (33% heard a lot versus 25%). There are no significant differences in awareness of the cell phone warning between those who have cell phones and those who do not. And those who rely entirely on cell phones for personal calls are more likely to say they have heard nothing at all about this story (25%) than are those who do not (17%). Three-quarters of the public say they had heard a lot (35%) or a little (40%) about the Florida trial of Casey Anthony, a mother charged with killing her young daughter. More women than men have heard a lot about this story (40% vs. 30%). Fewer people had heard about an E. coli outbreak in Europe: 23% say they had heard a lot, 39% a little. More than half of Americans had heard a lot (23%) or a little (33%) about a controversy involving a sexually suggestive photo of Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-New York) sent out over Twitter. Republicans are more likely to have heard a lot about the Weiner story (33% heard a lot) than either Democrats (20%) or independents (22%). (This poll was conducted before Weiner’s June 6 press conference, in which he admitted to using social media to send inappropriate photos.) These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected May 30-June 5, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected June 2-5 from a nationally representative sample of 1,006 adults.","Eight - in - ten Americans say they had heard a lot ( 29 % ) or a little ( 52 % ) about an international health panel warning of a possible link between cell phone use and brain cancer .

In a Pew Research Center survey released Monday, 65% of people say jobs in their community are difficult to find — down from the record levels seen in early 2010, but far above pre-Great Recession levels. Only 27% say jobs are plentiful. The disconnect between public attitudes and the official joblessness data supports the idea that the unemployment rate — one of the most widely reported economic statistics, along with inflation and GDP  — isn’t fully capturing what’s happening in the U.S. economy. Part of the reason is simple arithmetic: Much of the decline in the unemployment rate comes not from more people finding work but from fewer people actively looking for it, and thus not counted as being in the labor force. (The labor-force participation rate last month, 62.8%, was as low as it’s been since early 1978.) But the jobs and unemployment numbers are net figures, and obscure much of the U.S. economy’s churn and change — which is the way people looking for work or considering switching jobs or careers actually experience it. Other, lower-profile measures do capture those dynamics; they show that something has changed in the U.S. labor market, and not for the better. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, provides estimates of vacancies, hires, voluntary quits and involuntary separations starting in December 2000. (The latest JOLTS numbers are from February; March numbers are due to be released this coming Friday.) The most immediately striking thing about the JOLTS numbers is how flat hiring has been for some time. February’s seasonally adjusted hiring rate — defined as hires as a percentage of total nonfarm employment — was 3.3%, the same as it’s been since October last year. In fact, there’s been no significant improvement in the hiring rate for nearly three years. By comparison, the hiring rate before the Great Recession typically was at or near 4%. The quits rate — the number people who voluntarily leave their jobs as a percentage of total employment — has improved somewhat from its 2009-10 lows, but at 1.7% is still well below pre-recession levels (typically 2% or higher). The quits rate is a good indicator of labor-market confidence, since people are more willing to leave their jobs when they’re confident they can find a better one. Job openings have, in fact, rebounded strongly from the recession, though not quite to their pre-crash levels. But even that silver lining comes with its own cloud: Unemployment is higher than one would expect, given the historical relationship between openings and unemployment. The job-openings rate — the estimated number of vacant positions as a percentage of total payroll employment plus openings, as gathered in a monthly survey of employers — typically moves in the opposite direction from the unemployment rate. This makes intuitive sense: When unemployment is low, there’s a smaller pool of readily available workers, so openings can take longer to fill; high unemployment means lots of available workers, presumably making it easier to fill any vacancies that occur. Plotting the two rates together creates what economists call the Beveridge curve. However, since the end of the Great Recession in 2009 the Beveridge curve has shifted upward and to the right, indicating that  even though U.S. employers have more job openings, they’re not tapping the pool of unemployed Americans to fill those vacancies as quickly as they used to. In February, for instance, the openings rate was 2.9% and unemployment was 6.7%. Back in July 2006, when the openings rate also was 2.9%, unemployment was just 4.7%. (As Federal Reserve researchers note, other countries have experienced similar shifts since the Great Recession.) This shift is reflected in the continuing high levels of long-term unemployment. In April nearly 3.5 million people, or 35.1% of all unemployed, had been out of work for more than 26 weeks. Economists have offered several explanations for the persistent long-term unemployment: an unintended consequence of extending jobless benefits; a mismatch between the skills unemployed workers have and what employers want; a breakdown in the efficiency of labor markets; or more workers living too far from the available jobs.","The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey , or JOLTS , provides estimates of vacancies , hires , voluntary quits and involuntary separations starting in December 2000 .

New findings in a national survey show: Still, 59% of internet users do not believe it is possible to be completely anonymous online, while 37% of them believe it is possible. A section of the survey looking at various security-related issues finds that notable numbers of internet users say they have experienced problems because others stole their personal information or otherwise took advantage of their visibility online—including hijacked email and social media accounts, stolen information such as Social Security numbers or credit card information, stalking or harassment, loss of reputation, or victimization by scammers. Some 68% of internet users believe current laws are not good enough in protecting people’s privacy online and 24% believe current laws provide reasonable protections. Most internet users know that key pieces of personal information about them are available online—such as photos and videos of them, their email addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, home addresses, and the groups to which they belong. And growing numbers of internet users (50%) say they are worried about the amount of personal information about them that is online—a figure that has jumped from 33% who expressed such worry in 2009. People would like control over their information, saying in many cases it is very important to them that only they or the people they authorize should be given access to such things as the content of their emails, the people to whom they are sending emails, the place where they are when they are online, and the content of the files they download. About this survey This survey by the Pew Research Center’s Internet Project was underwritten by Carnegie Mellon University. The findings in this report are based on data from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from July 11-14, among a sample of 1,002 adults ages 18 and older. Telephone interviews were conducted in English by landline and cell phone. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points and for the results from 792 internet and smartphone users in the sample, the margin of error is 3.8 percentage points. More information is available in the Methods section at the end of this report. 86% of internet users have tried to use the internet in ways to minimize the visibility of their digital footprints The chart below shows the variety of ways that internet users have tried to avoid being observed online. 55% of internet users have taken steps to hide from specific people or organizations Beyond their general hope that they can go online anonymously, the majority of internet users have tried to avoid observation by other people, groups, companies, and government agencies. Hackers, criminals and advertisers are at the top of the list of groups people wish to avoid. Users report that a wide range of their personal information is available online, but feel strongly about controlling who has access to certain kinds of behavioral data and communications content. Users know that there is a considerable amount of personal information about them available online. Among the list of items queried, photos were the most commonly reported content posted online; 66% of internet users reported that an image of them was available online. And half (50%) say that their birth date is available. Another set of questions focused on the kinds of “data exhaust” that is generated as a result of everyday forms of online communications, web surfing and application use. Respondents were asked how much they cared “that only you and those you authorize should have access” to certain kinds of behavioral data and communications content and there was notable variance in the answers. The content of email messages and the people with whom one communicates via email are considerably more sensitive pieces of information when compared with other online activities and associated data trails.","Another set of questions focused on the kinds of “ data exhaust ” that is generated as a result of everyday forms of online communications , web surfing and application use .

Some of the vice president’s statements on Christian persecution comport with data from a recent Pew Research Center report on global religious restrictions in 2015. Christians have been harassed in more countries than any other religious group and have suffered harassment in many of the heavily Muslim countries of the Middle East and North Africa. But the report also shows that this widespread harassment is due in part to the huge size and broad geographic dispersion of Christians around the world, and that the Middle East is just one of a number of regions where Christians have faced harassment. (The Center’s recent report tracks harassment against religious groups around the world, but it does not attempt to estimate the number of victims in each country. As a result, it does not speak to the intensity of harassment in each country.) Christians were harassed by governments or social groups in a total of 128 countries in 2015 – more countries than any other religious group, according to the report. But there also were 2.3 billion Christians in 2015, more than any other religious group. Large populations of Christians are present in all but a few parts of the world: Roughly two-thirds of the world’s countries, for example, have Christian majorities. By contrast, smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries. For instance, because of their dense concentration in a small number of countries, 99% of Jews and Hindus lived in nations where members of their groups were harassed. And despite being one of the most geographically dispersed religious groups, 97% of Muslims lived in countries where harassment of Muslims occurred in 2015. (By comparison, 78% of Christians lived in places where Christians were harassed.) Due in part to the large number of Christian-majority countries, Christians were actually harassed mostly in Christian-majority countries. In some of these countries, the Christian majority was itself harassed, often by the government. For example, in Nicaragua – where an estimated 59% of the population is Catholic – the Catholic Church reported that the government monitored its emails and telephone conversations and granted financial support for churches based on the clergy’s political affiliation. The church also reported that the Nicaraguan government used Catholic traditions and symbols when promoting political agendas, saying it undermined the church’s religious authority. In other Christian-majority countries, Christian minority denominations were targeted. For example, in Eritrea – where Eritrean Orthodox Christianity is the dominant faith – Jehovah’s Witnesses reported being unable to obtain official identification documents because of their faith. In addition, the majority of religious prisoners in Eritrea in 2015 were Protestants, namely Pentecostals and evangelical Christians. While Christians were harassed in countries far beyond the Middle East and North Africa, they faced significant harassment in this region, too. In Syria, for example, Christians reported that tolerance within society was on the decline as extremist groups gained influence. And in Egypt, Christians were killed for having converted from Islam or simply because they were Christian. For example, in January and February 2015, two Christian men were killed – one of these murders was claimed by the Islamic State – in the North Sinai city of Arish, according to a Christian advocacy group with a presence in the region.","By contrast , smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries .

Mosquitoes Country leaving the EU United Kingdom DOJ lead Russia investigator Mueller","The latest Pew Research Center News IQ quiz finds that many Americans struggle when it comes to identifying some major political figures, though a majority knows that Paul Ryan is speaker of the House of Representatives. On the other hand, there is broad awareness of details related to how the Zika virus is spread (86% know it is primarily spread by mosquitoes). In addition, 72% know that tap water in Flint, Michigan, is unsafe because it contains too much lead. While 62% correctly identify Paul Ryan as speaker of the House, fewer (45%) know that Neil Gorsuch is a Supreme Court justice. (Full question wording available here.) About half (47%) identify Robert Mueller as the person leading the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, while 44% know that the current secretary of state is Rex Tillerson. Public knowledge of international developments varies. Six-in-ten (60%) identify the United Kingdom as the country that has officially begun the process of leaving the European Union. However, just 37% identify Emmanuel Macron as president of France (the survey was conducted before President Donald Trump’s visit to France). The new survey, conducted June 22-25 among 1,002 adults, finds substantial age differences in knowledge about several Washington figures. For instance, a majority of those 50 and older (56%) know that Tillerson is secretary of state, compared with 32% of those younger than 50. Older adults also are more likely to know that Gorsuch is a Supreme Court justice, and that Mueller is leading the investigation into Russia’s involvement in the presidential campaign. However, majorities across age categories correctly identify Ryan as House speaker. There are no significant age differences in awareness of the United Kingdom as the country taking steps to leave the EU or in the share who correctly identify Macron as president of France. And large majorities, regardless of age, are able to correctly state that mosquitoes are the primary way the Zika virus is spread to humans and to identify lead as the reason the tap water in Flint, Michigan, is unsafe. There is little difference in news knowledge across partisan groups, with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Democrats and Democratic leaners answering about the same number of questions correctly on average (5.7 questions vs. 5.5 questions, respectively). Republicans are somewhat more likely than Democrats to correctly identify Paul Ryan as the speaker of the House (69% vs. 61%). There are only modest partisan differences on other questions in the survey. As in past surveys, college graduates perform better than those with less education on the News IQ quiz. Those with a bachelor’s degree or more education answer an average of 6.9 questions correctly, compared to 5.2 correct answers from those with some college experience and 4.3 from those with no more than a high school diploma. The educational divide is evident across all of the questions asked, but majorities regardless of educational attainment are able to correctly answer that the Zika virus is spread primarily by mosquitoes and that the tap water in Flint, Michigan, is unsafe due to lead.","On the other hand , there is broad awareness of details related to how the Zika virus is spread ( 86 % know it is primarily spread by mosquitoes ) .

Most notably, Americans are more individualistic and are less supportive of a strong safety net than are the publics of Britain, France, Germany and Spain. Americans are also considerably more religious than Western Europeans, and are more socially conservative with respect to homosexuality. Americans are somewhat more inclined than Western Europeans to say that it is sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world. Moreover, Americans more often than their Western European allies believe that obtaining UN approval before their country uses military force would make it too difficult to deal with an international threat. And Americans are less inclined than the Western Europeans, with the exception of the French, to help other nations. These differences between Americans and Western Europeans echo findings from previous surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center. However, the current polling shows the American public is coming closer to Europeans in not seeing their culture as superior to that of other nations. Today, only about half of Americans believe their culture is superior to others, compared with six-in-ten in 2002. And the polling finds younger Americans less apt than their elders to hold American exceptionalist attitudes. These are among the findings from a survey by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, conducted in the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Spain from March 21 to April 14 as part of the broader 23-nation poll in spring 2011. Three-quarters of Americans agree that it is sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world; this view is shared by seven-in-ten in Britain and narrower majorities in France and Spain (62% each). Germans are evenly divided, with half saying the use of force is sometimes necessary and half saying it is not. Germans are more supportive of the use of military force than they have been in recent years. For example, in 2007, just about four-in-ten (41%) Germans agreed that it was sometimes necessary, while 58% disagreed. Opinions have been more stable in the U.S., Britain and France. For the most part, opinions about the use of force do not vary considerably across demographic groups. In Germany and Spain, however, support for the use of military force is far more widespread among men than among women. Six-in-ten German men agree that it is sometimes necessary to use military force to maintain order in the world, compared with just 40% of women. And while majorities across gender groups in Spain believe the use of force may be necessary, more Spanish men than Spanish women say this is the case (68% vs. 56%). In Britain, France, Spain and the U.S., conservatives, or those on the political right, are more likely than liberals, or those on the left, to agree that the use of force is sometimes necessary to maintain world order. However, in the four countries, majorities across ideological groups express this view.1 When asked whether their country should have UN approval before using military force to deal with international threats, American opinion differs considerably from that of Western Europeans. Americans are almost evenly divided on the question, with 45% saying that the U.S. should have UN approval while 44% say this would make it too difficult to deal with threats; in contrast, solid majorities in the four Western European nations surveyed, including about three-quarters in Spain (74%) and Germany (76%) say their country should have UN approval before it takes military action. In Western Europe, those with a college degree are more likely than those with less education to say their country should have UN approval before using military force, although majorities across both groups share this view. For example, in Spain, 84% of those who graduated from college say UN approval should be obtained, compared with 70% of those who do not have a college degree. Double-digit differences are also evident in Britain (15 percentage points), Germany (11 points) and France (10 points). This is not the case in the U.S., where respondents across education groups offer nearly identical views. In Germany, gender differences are also notable; even though German men are more likely than women to say the use of military force is sometimes necessary, more men than women say their country should have UN approval before using force (83% vs. 70%). The view that their country should have UN approval before using military force to deal with threats is far more prevalent among American liberals than among conservatives. Close to six-in-ten (57%) liberals favor obtaining UN approval, while 33% say this would make it too difficult for the U.S. to deal with threats; in contrast, most conservatives (52%) say getting UN approval would make it too difficult to deal with threats, while 38% say this is an important step. Political moderates fall between the other two groups, with 49% saying the U.S. should seek the approval of the UN before using military force and 42% saying this would make it too difficult to deal with threats. The same ideological difference is generally not evident in Western Europe. About four-in-ten (39%) Americans say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems, while a narrow majority (52%) says the U.S. should deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their problems as best they can. In this regard, Americans are not drastically different from respondents in France, where 43% believe their country should help other countries and 57% say it should focus on its own problems. The British are nearly evenly divided; 45% say their country should help other countries deal with their problems and about the same number (48%) believe Britain should deal with its own problems. Compared with the U.S., France and Britain, Spain and Germany stand out as the only countries where majorities favor international engagement: 55% and 54%, respectively, say their countries should provide assistance to others, while 40% in Spain and 43% in Germany take the more isolationist view. Opinions about international engagement have changed somewhat in the U.S., France and Spain since last year, but while publics in the two Western European countries are now more in favor of helping others than they were in 2010, more Americans currently take an isolationist position. Last year, about the same number of Americans said their country should help other countries (45%) as said it should let other countries deal with their own problems (46%). Similarly, the Spanish were nearly evenly divided, with 49% favoring engagement and 47% taking an isolationist approach. In France, where a majority continues to take an isolationist view, even more (65%) did so a year ago. In the U.S. as well as in the four Western European countries surveyed, those with a college degree are far more likely than those with less education to offer an internationalist view. This is especially the case in Germany, where about three-quarters (73%) of those who graduated from college believe their country should help other countries deal with their problems, compared with a narrow majority (52%) of those without a college degree. Political ideology is also a factor in Germany, France and Spain. In these three countries, those on the right are more likely than those on the left to take the isolationist view when it comes to international engagement. For example, while about half (48%) of left-wing French say their country should deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with theirs as best they can, about six-in-ten (59%) on the right offer this opinion. About half of Americans (49%) and Germans (47%) agree with the statement, “Our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others;” 44% in Spain share this view. In Britain and France, only about a third or fewer (32% and 27%, respectively) think their culture is better than others. While opinions about cultural superiority have remained relatively stable over the years in the four Western European countries surveyed, Americans are now far less likely to say that their culture is better than others; six-in-ten Americans held this belief in 2002 and 55% did so in 2007. Belief in cultural superiority has declined among Americans across age, gender and education groups. As in past surveys, older Americans remain far more inclined than younger ones to believe that their culture is better than others. Six-in-ten Americans ages 50 or older share this view, while 34% disagree; those younger than 30 hold the opposite view, with just 37% saying American culture is superior and 61% saying it is not. Opinions are more divided among those ages 30 to 49; 44% in this group see American culture as superior and 50% do not. Similar age gaps are not as common in the Western European countries surveyed, with the exception of Spain, where majorities of older respondents, but not among younger ones, also think their culture is better than others; 55% of those ages 50 or older say this is the case, compared with 34% of those ages 30 to 49 and 39% of those younger than 30. As is the case on other measures, opinions about cultural superiority vary considerably by educational attainment. In the four Western European countries and in the U.S., those who did not graduate from college are more likely than those who did to agree that their culture is superior, even if their people are not perfect. For example, Germans with less education are about twice as likely as those with a college degree to believe their culture is superior (49% vs. 25%); double-digit differences are also present in France (20 percentage points), Spain (18 points) and Britain (11 points), while a less pronounced gap is evident in the U.S. (9 points). Finally, among Americans and Germans, political conservative are especially likely to believe their culture is superior to others. In the U.S., 63% of conservatives take this view, compared with 45% of moderates and just 34% of liberals. Similarly, a majority (54%) of right-wing Germans see their culture as superior, while 47% of moderates and 33% of those on the political left agree. American opinions continue to differ considerably from those of Western Europeans when it comes to views of individualism and the role of the state. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) Americans believe it is more important for everyone to be free to pursue their life’s goals without interference from the state, while just 35% say it is more important for the state to play an active role in society so as to guarantee that nobody is in need. In contrast, at least six-in-ten in Spain (67%), France (64%) and Germany (62%) and 55% in Britain say the state should ensure that nobody is in need; about four-in-ten or fewer consider being free from state interference a higher priority. In the U.S., Britain, France and Germany, views of the role of the state divide significantly across ideological lines. For example, three-quarters of American conservatives say individuals should be free to pursue their goals without interference from the state, while 21% say it is more important for the state to guarantee that nobody is in need; among liberals in the U.S., half would like the state to play an active role to help the needy, while 42% prefer a more limited role for the state. Those on the political right in Britain, France and Germany are also more likely than those on the left in these countries to prioritize freedom to pursue one’s goals without state interference. Unlike in the U.S., however, majorities of those on the right in France (57%) and Germany (56%) favor an active role for the state, as do more than four-in-ten (45%) conservatives in Britain. American opinions about the role of the state also vary considerably across age groups. About half (47%) of those younger than 30 prioritize the freedom to pursue life’s goals without interference from the state and a similar percentage (46%) say it is more important for the state to ensure that nobody is in need; among older Americans, however, about six-in-ten consider being free a higher priority, with just about three-in-ten saying the state should play an active role so that nobody is in need. No such age difference is evident in the four Western European countries surveyed. Asked if they agree that “success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control,” Americans again offer more individualistic views than those expressed by Western Europeans. Only 36% of Americans believe they have little control over their fate, compared with 50% in Spain, 57% in France and 72% in Germany; Britain is the only Western European country surveyed where fewer than half (41%) share this view. In the U.S. and in Western Europe, those without a college degree are less individualistic than those who have graduated from college; this is especially the case in the U.S. and Germany. About three-quarters (74%) of Germans in the less educated group believe that success in life is largely determined by forces beyond one’s control, compared with 55% of college graduates. Among Americans, 41% of those without a college degree say they have little control over their fate, while just 22% of college graduates share this view. Americans also distinguish themselves from Western Europeans on views about the importance of religion. Half of Americans deem religion very important in their lives; fewer than a quarter in Spain (22%), Germany (21%), Britain (17%) and France (13%) share this view. Moreover, Americans are far more inclined than Western Europeans to say it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values; 53% say this is the case in the U.S., compared with just one-third in Germany, 20% in Britain, 19% in Spain and 15% in France. In the U.S., women and older respondents place more importance on religion and are more likely than men and younger people to say that faith in God is a necessary foundation for morality and good values. About six-in-ten (59%) American women say religion is very important in their lives, compared with 41% of men; and while a majority (56%) of Americans ages 50 and older say religion is very important to them, 48% of those ages 30 to 49 and 41% of those younger than 30 place similar importance on religion. Similarly, while a majority of American women (58%) say it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values, men are nearly evenly divided, with 47% saying belief in God is a necessary foundation for morality and 51% saying it is not. Among Americans ages 50 and older, 58% say one must believe in God in order to be moral and have good values; 50% of those ages 30 to 49 and 46% of those younger than 30 share this view. Education also plays a role in views of religion in the U.S., to some extent. Although Americans with a college degree are about as likely as those without to say religion is very important to them (47% and 51%, respectively), the less educated are far more inclined to say that one must believe in God in order to be moral; 59% of those without a college degree say this, compared with 37% of those who have graduated from college. Views of religion and whether belief in God is a necessary foundation for morality vary little, if at all, across demographic groups in the Western European countries surveyed. In Spain, however, respondents ages 50 and older place more importance on religion than do younger people, although relatively few in this age group say it is very important to them; 33% say this is the case, compared with 16% of those ages 30 to 49 and 11% of those younger than 30. Politically, conservatives in the U.S., Spain and Germany are more likely than liberals to say it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values, but while solid majorities of conservatives in the U.S. (66%) take this position, fewer than half of conservatives in Spain (31%) and Germany (46%) share this view. Meanwhile, just 26% of liberals in the U.S., 11% in Spain and 19% in Germany say belief in God is a necessary foundation for morality. Conservatives in the U.S. are also far more likely than liberals to consider religion very important in their lives (67% vs. 29%); in Western Europe, few across ideological groups place high importance on religion. American Christians are more likely than their Western European counterparts to think of themselves first in terms of their religion rather than their nationality; 46% of Christians in the U.S. see themselves primarily as Christians and the same number consider themselves Americans first. In contrast, majorities of Christians in France (90%), Germany (70%), Britain (63%) and Spain (53%) identify primarily with their nationality rather than their religion. In Britain, France and Germany, more Christians now see themselves in terms of their nationality than did so five years ago, when national identification was already widespread in these countries. This change is especially notable in Germany, where the percentage seeing themselves first as Germans is up 11 percentage points, from 59% in 2006. Among Christians in the U.S., white evangelicals are especially inclined to identify first with their faith; 70% in this group see themselves first as Christians rather than as Americans, while 22% say they are primarily American. Among other American Christians, more identify with their nationality (55%) than with their religion (38%). Tolerance for homosexuality is widespread in the U.S. and Western Europe, but far more Western Europeans than Americans say homosexuality should be accepted by society; at least eight-in-ten in Spain (91%), Germany (87%), France (86%) and Britain (81%), compared with 60% in the U.S. Acceptance of homosexuality has increased in recent years, and the shift is especially notable in the U.S., where only slightly more said it should be accepted (49%) than said it should be rejected (41%) in 2007. Today, more Americans accept homosexuality than reject it by a 27-percentage point margin. While there are some differences in opinions of homosexuality across demographic groups in the Western European countries surveyed, overwhelming majorities across age, education and gender groups believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. In the U.S., however, these differences are somewhat more pronounced. For example, while 67% of American women believe homosexuality should be accepted, a much narrower majority of men (54%) share that view. Among Americans with college degrees, 71% accept homosexuality, compared with 56% of those with less education. Finally, about two-thirds (68%) of Americans younger than 30 say homosexuality should be accepted by society; 61% of those ages 30 to 40 and 55% of those ages 50 and older share this view. In addition to demographic differences, an ideological divide on views of homosexuality is also notable in the U.S., where more than eight-in-ten (85%) liberals and 65% of moderates express tolerant views, compared with 44% of conservatives. In the four Western European countries surveyed, at least three-quarters across ideological groups say homosexuality should be accepted by society.","About four - in - ten ( 39 % ) Americans say the U.S. should help other countries deal with their problems , while a narrow majority ( 52 % ) says the U.S. should deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their problems as best they can .

In our new survey examining the public’s attitudes about government, just 25% say that, “on the issues that matter,” their side has been winning more often than it has been losing. More than twice as many (64%) say their side loses more often than it wins. The feeling that political losses outnumber victories is widely shared across demographic groups. Substantial majorities of men (66%) and women (62%) feel like their side loses more than it wins. And there are only modest differences when it comes to race and ethnicity: 66% of whites, 65% of blacks and 59% of Hispanics all say their political side loses more often than it wins. Yet there are clear partisan differences – fully 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say their side loses more often than it wins, compared with 52% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. This is yet another indication of the broad dissatisfaction Republicans express toward politics, a feeling that extends to views of the GOP-led Congress and their own party. While Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate, favorable ratings for Congress – while extremely low among members of both parties – are lower among Republicans (23% favorable) than Democrats (31%). In addition, more Republicans than Democrats continue to view their own party unfavorably (31% vs. 19%). However, while Republicans generally feel like their side is “losing,” most Democrats do not feel like political “winners.” Overall, about half of Democrats and Democratic leaners say their side in politics loses more than it wins, and this sentiment is especially widespread among Democrats with lower levels of education. A majority of Democrats with no more than a high school education (59%), as well as those with some college experience (54%), say their side loses more than it prevails. Among the only groups who feel like they’re winning are well-educated Democrats. Those with at least a college degree are more likely to say they feel like their side is winning (51%) than say it’s losing (41%). In general, younger people are more likely than older people to feel their side is winning: About a third of those under 50 (30%) say their side wins more than it loses compared with 20% of those 50 and older. Older Republicans are more likely than younger Republicans to see their side as losing in politics today. Still, a majority of Republicans under 30 (69%) do hold this view, and they are much more likely to say this than their Democratic counterparts. Just half of young Democrats say this. What we found – perhaps not surprisingly – is that, in general, feelings of political “losing” are associated with higher levels of anger toward government. Among those who say their side loses more than it wins politically, 27% are angry at the federal government – three times the percentage among those who feel like their side wins more frequently (9%).","What we found – perhaps not surprisingly – is that , in general , feelings of political “ losing ” are associated with higher levels of anger toward government .

The public’s economic expectations, while hardly robust in the spring, have grown much more negative. Nearly four-in-ten (37%) think economic conditions will be worse a year from now, up from 24% in May and 18% in January. At the same time, higher energy prices are now having a major impact on Americans’ daily lives, with 70% saying they are driving less to save money on gas. As was the case in the spring, Americans are largely critical of the overall performance of both major parties. But the Republicans face greater political dangers. In an early test of strength on next year’s midterm elections, Republicans trail by 52%-40% among registered voters. Equally important, Democrats are favored on most major issues. Even on terrorism, which consistently has been a Republican strength, the GOP’s advantage has narrowed. Public support for the U.S. military effort in Iraq has held steady through the summer, despite ongoing violence in that country. Roughly half of Americans (51%) continue to support maintaining U.S. troops in Iraq until the situation there has stabilized. However, there is growing sentiment in favor of setting a timetable for withdrawing the troops ­ 57% favor that step now, up from 49% in July. Moreover, a steadily growing number of Americans feel Iraq will turn out to be another Vietnam. About four-in-ten (39%) express this view, compared with 29% a year ago. The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press of 1,523 Americans, conducted Sept. 8-11, finds that rising energy prices have affected American lifestyles in a variety of ways. Nearly three-in-ten (27%) report they have bought a car that gets better gas mileage. And with winter three months off, 64% of Americans say they are adjusting their home thermostats to reduce energy bills. The survey finds that the rise in energy prices also has had a perceptible impact on public views of the tradeoff between boosting the energy supply and protecting the environment. A solid majority (57%) now says it is more important to develop new energy sources than to protect the environment, up from 49% who expressed that view in March. Support for oil and gas drilling in the Alaskan Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) also has gained, from 42% in March to 50% currently. Democrats, in particular, are much more receptive to drilling in the Alaska refuge. Yet the public also overwhelmingly supports government efforts to require better fuel efficiency from cars, trucks and SUVs. Fully 86% favor the government requiring improved efficiency; there is virtually no partisan difference on this issue. Sizable but smaller majorities back several other possible policies to address the energy situation, including price controls on fuel and energy (69%). But despite growing concern over energy supplies and prices, most Americans oppose the government promoting the increased use of nuclear power. For the most part, the public blames energy producers for rising gas prices, but many also fault the president. More than a third (36%) blame major oil companies, while 27% point to President Bush and his administration. About one-in-five (18%) blame OPEC, Middle Eastern countries, and other foreign oil producers. Just 36% express confidence that the president is taking the right approach to solving the nation’s energy problems. Bush’s overall job approval rating stands at 40%, unchanged since last week (Sept. 6-7). Economic Perceptions More Americans hold a pessimistic outlook on the nation’s economic prospects than at any time during Bush’s presidency. By two-to-one (37%-18%), more believe the economy will be in worse shape a year from now than believe things will improve. In August 2004, just 9% said they expected the economy to worsen over the succeeding 12 months. That number doubled to 18% in January, and has doubled again (to 37%). The public’s assessments of current economic conditions, while negative, have not declined since May. About three-in-ten (31%) rate economic conditions as good or excellent, while about twice as many view things as only fair or poor (68%). Opinion was similar in May (32% good/excellent, 67% only fair/poor). Since January, pessimism about the direction of America’s economy has increased across the political spectrum, but has grown most among political independents. In January, somewhat more independents said the economy would get better over the following year than said it would get worse (24% vs. 17%). In the current survey, more than three times as many independents expect economic conditions to worsen over the next year as expect them to improve (42% vs. 12%). This generally negative outlook exists across the economic spectrum. Among both wealthy and poor, more see the economy over the next year getting worse, not better, by a margin of roughly two-to-one. The Democratic Party is widely seen as the party better able to handle a wide range of policy issues. In addition to favoring the Democratic Party on its traditional strengths such as reforming the health care system and protecting the environment, pluralities today also pick the Democrats to handle energy problems, Social Security, and education. On the important issues of the economy and Iraq, the public is more divided, with the Democrats holding only a slight edge. And on the issue of ensuring that the government can handle major disasters, 40% favor the Democrats, while 34% choose the Republicans. The single issue that still works to the Republican Party’s advantage is dealing with the terrorist threat at home ­ 45% say the Republicans can do a better job on this, while 34% choose the Democrats. But even here, the GOP’s edge has narrowed significantly as the Democrats have made gains. In the lead-up to the 2002 midterm the Republican Party held a two-to-one (44% vs. 22%) edge on this issue. Much of the Democrats’ overall issue advantage can be attributed to the views of independents, who decidedly favor the Democratic Party’s leadership across nearly all issues. For example, the Democrats’ narrow 44%-35% edge on education overall reflects a more substantial 48%-27% advantage among independents. Similarly, independents clearly favor the Democratic Party’s approach to dealing with energy problems, the economy, and the situation in Iraq. And even more notably, when it comes to environmental and health care issues, independents have more faith in the Democrats than the Republicans by margins of roughly three-to-one. The Democrats currently hold a 12-point advantage in the congressional horserace. While most partisans say they plan to stick with their party’s candidate, independent voters currently lean Democratic by two-to-one (55% to 27%). Despite their issue advantages, Democratic leaders in Congress receive only a 36% job approval rating overall, the same rating given to their GOP counterparts. The low mark for Democratic leaders reflects significant dissatisfaction among their own partisans. Just 49% of Democrats approve of the job their leaders are doing in Congress, down from 64% in May. By comparison, 72% of Republicans approve of the job their congressional leaders are doing. Independents , on balance, disapprove of both parties’ congressional leadership. Democrats have expressed a good deal of dissatisfaction with the direction of their party in Washington since George W. Bush took office, but this sentiment has become particularly widespread since the 2004 election. Currently, 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the party is doing only a fair or a poor job standing up for its traditional positions on such things as protecting the interests of minorities, helping the poor and needy, and representing working people. Barely a third give the party excellent (3%) or good (32%) marks. While less critical than the Democrats, Republicans, too, have become increasingly disillusioned with the job their party is doing standing up for its traditional positions on such things as reducing the size of government, cutting taxes and promoting conservative social values. The percentage of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who rate the party favorably has fallen from 61% just over a year ago to 48% today. This is the lowest level of GOP satisfaction on this question since before Bush took office. Overall, most registered voters (57%) say they would like to see their representative in Congress reelected in 2006, while 25% say they want their representative replaced. At the same time, only 36% say they want to see most members return for another term, while nearly half (48%) want to see most members of Congress voted out next year. The latter is among the highest levels of dissatisfaction with Congress measured by the Pew Research Center in the last decade, exceeded only by pre-election polls in 1994 when clear majorities wanted most members to lose their jobs. Much of the dissatisfaction behind these figures comes from Democrats and independents. By a 57% to 29% margin, a majority of Democrats say they want most of Congress replaced, and independents agree (by a 59% to 29% margin). Roughly half of Republicans (49%) say they want to see most members keep their jobs. But even among Republicans, nearly a third (32%) say they would like to see most incumbents voted out. A solid majority of Americans (57%) rate developing new energy sources as a higher priority than protecting the environment. That represents a modest change from recent years, when slightly fewer than half viewed developing energy sources as a greater priority. There has been a comparable shift in views on whether it is more important to expand energy exploration or increase conservation. Opinion tilts slightly in favor of conservation (by 48%-43%), but by a smaller margin than in 2002. Young people, in particular, now view developing new energy sources as a more important priority than protecting the environment. Currently, 58% of those ages 18-29 say developing new energy sources is a more important priority than protecting the environment; in March, a narrow majority of young people rated environmental protection as the more important priority. Similarly, 63% of college graduates now view energy development as a more important priority than environmental protection; in March, 50% expressed that view. On a related issue, most Americans (52%) say trying to find new energy supplies should take precedence over controlling rising gas prices and dealing with current energy shortages. But somewhat more rate controlling prices as a higher priority than did so in May 2001, when there was also intense focus on energy (36% now vs. 31% then). When the public is asked who is most to blame for rising gas prices, a plurality (36%) points to major oil companies. More than a quarter (27%) say the president or his administration is most to blame for the price hike. OPEC and other foreign oil producers also get a share of the blame (18%). About one-in-ten (9%) blame Hurricane Katrina, while about as many (8%) blame people who own SUVs and other low gas mileage vehicles. In another sign of public skepticism toward major oil companies, 73% of Americans say that the current high price of gas is the result of companies taking advantage of the situation, rather than because of real shortages in the oil supply. Roughly half of Americans (48%) say that, if the U.S. is to become less dependent on oil, it is very important for people now driving SUVs to switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles. That is slightly more than the number expressing that opinion in a November 2001 poll by Newsweek (42%). People ages 65 and older, in particular, feel it is very important for SUV drivers to shift to vehicles with better gas mileage. Nearly six-in-ten senior citizens say this, compared with about half of those ages 50-64 (51%) and fewer of those younger than 50 (44%). Democrats and independents also are much more likely than Republicans to place great importance on SUV drivers moving to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Overall, about three-in-ten Americans (27%) say that, in dealing with higher energy costs, they have bought a car that gets better gas mileage. Interestingly, there are only modest demographic differences on this measure, although Americans ages 65 and older are somewhat less likely than younger people to have done this. There are bigger differences among political groups, however. About four-in-ten liberal Democrats (39%) say they have bought a car that gets better gas mileage, the highest proportion in any political/ideological group. Despite a long summer with continued casualties, and a widely covered anti-war protest outside the president’s vacation ranch, public attitudes on the war in Iraq are remarkable for their overall stability. Most continue to see the military effort in Iraq going either very (12%) or fairly (41%) well, and the proportion that says taking military action there was the right decision has held steady at 49%, while 44% think it was the wrong decision. A slim 51% majority believes the U.S. should keep military troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized, while 45% want to bring troops home as soon as possible. An equal number believes that military action in Iraq has helped the war on terrorism as say it has hurt. This represents a slight improvement since July, but is consistent with most measures taken since mid-2004 that show the public divided on this question. But public optimism about the long-term continues to wane, and support for setting a timetable for when U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Iraq has risen notably. The proportion of Americans who think the situation in Iraq is likely to turn out to be like Vietnam rose from 29% a year ago to 35% this June to 39% today. This shift has been most pronounced among independents and younger people. A year ago, just 29% of independents saw Iraq turning into another Vietnam; today, a 46% plurality expresses this view. And the number of Americans under age 30 who foresee Iraq becoming another Vietnam has doubled from 22% to 42% over the same time period. In this regard, the most notable shift in public opinion about the situation in Iraq over the summer is increasing support for the idea of setting a timetable for troop withdrawal, from 49% in July to 57% today. The idea of a timetable has opened up a rare fissure among typically unified Republicans. Currently, a 58% majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say the U.S. should set a timetable for when troops will be withdrawn from Iraq, up from 36% two months ago. By comparison, a 58% majority of conservative Republicans oppose the idea of setting such a timetable. By two-to-one (63% to 30%), most Americans believe George W. Bush does not have a clear plan for bringing the situation in Iraq to a successful conclusion ­ but even fewer believe that Democratic leaders in Congress are providing a clear alternative. Just 18% say Democrats have a clear alternative for how to deal with the situation in Iraq, while 71% say they do not. While Bush rates better than Democrats, this is due to his strong backing among Republicans. Most independents are skeptical about the strategy offered by both Bush and the Democrats. Just 19% of independents say Bush has a clear plan for how to succeed, and only 16% say Democratic leaders in Congress have a clear alternative for how to deal with the situation. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (64%) express confidence in Bush’s plan, while barely a quarter of Democrats (26%) believe Democratic leaders have a clear alternative. Nearly half of Americans (49%) believe that U.S. troops in Iraq do not have the resources and equipment they need to fight the war effectively, while 44% say that they do. Not surprisingly, there is a wide partisan divide on the issue, with most Republicans expressing the view that supplies are adequate, and Democrats and independents agreeing that they are not. The public remains skeptical that democracy can succeed in Iraq if Islamic religious leaders are elected to positions of power. Nearly half (47%) say democracy will not take hold under these circumstances, up from 40% in February. Roughly a third (34%) believe democracy can succeed. Republicans are slightly more optimistic than Democrats and independents on this question, but the larger divide is generational. While pluralities in all age groups say democracy cannot succeed if Islamic religious leaders are elected to positions of power, 42% of Americans under age 30 believe democracy can work if this happens, compared with 36% of people age 30-49, 31% of people age 50-64 and just 24% of people age 65 and older. There are widely disparate views on how America should approach the issue of women’s rights in Iraq as the government there establishes its constitution and laws. One-in-five say the U.S. should insist that a new Iraqi government provide equal rights for women, while 29% believe we should not get involved in the issue at all. The more accepted option is a middle position ­ that the U.S. should encourage equal rights for women but leave it up to the Iraqis to decide. Interestingly, there is no gender gap on this question ­ men and women express nearly identical positions. Pluralities of Democrats and independents ­ and a solid majority of Republicans ­ feel the U.S. should encourage equal rights for women, but let the Iraqis decide the issue. But Democrats and independents are more likely than Republicans to say that the U.S. shouldn’t get involved.","By two - to - one ( 37%-18 % ) , more believe the economy will be in worse shape a year from now than believe things will improve .

But for many Americans, the reality of the online experience is substantially different. Today nearly two-thirds of Americans own a smartphone, and 19% of Americans rely to some degree on a smartphone for accessing online services and information and for staying connected to the world around them — either because they lack broadband at home, or because they have few options for online access other than their cell phone. Indeed, 7% of Americans own a smartphone but have neither traditional broadband service at home, nor easily available alternatives for going online other than their cell phone. This report documents the unique circumstances of this “smartphone-dependent” population, and also explores the ways in which smartphone owners use their phones to engage in a wide range of activities. Below are some more details about these major findings on the state of smartphone ownership in America today, based on a series of surveys conducted by Pew Research Center in association with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation: Nearly two-thirds of Americans are now smartphone owners, and for many these devices are a key entry point to the online world 64% of \t\tAmerican adults now own a smartphone of some kind, up from 35% in the spring of 2011.  \t\t Smartphone ownership is especially high among younger Americans, as well as those with relatively high income and education levels. And for a number of Americans, smartphones serve as an essential connection to the broader world of online information. The survey measured reliance on smartphones for online access in two different ways — first, by asking smartphone owners whether or not they have traditional broadband service at home, and second, whether they have a reasonable number of options for accessing the internet in general from any location. It found that: In all, one-in-five American adults (19%) indicate that at least one of those conditions apply to them, and \t\t7% of the public says that both of these conditions apply  \t\t — that is, they do not have broadband access at home, and also have relatively few options for getting online other than their cell phone. Throughout this report, we refer to this latter group as “smartphone-dependent” users. Certain groups of Americans rely on smartphones for online access at elevated levels, in particular: Compared with smartphone owners who are less reliant on their mobile devices, these smartphone-dependent users are less likely to own some other type of computing device, less likely to have a bank account, less likely to be covered by health insurance, and more likely to rent or to live with a friend or family member rather than own their own home. Even as a substantial minority of Americans indicate that their phone plays a central role in their ability to access digital services and online content, for many users this access is often intermittent due to a combination of financial stresses and technical constraints. Nearly half \t\t(48%) of smartphone-dependent Americans have had to cancel or shut off their cell phone service for a period of time because the cost of maintaining that service was a financial hardship.  \t\t In addition, 30% of smartphone-dependent Americans say that they “frequently” reach the maximum amount of data that they are allowed to consume as part of their cell phone plan, and 51% say that this happens to them at least occasionally. Each of these figures is substantially higher than those reported by smartphone owners with more access options at their disposal. Smartphones are used for much more than calling, texting, or basic internet browsing. Users are turning to these mobile devices as they navigate a wide range of life events: Lower-income smartphone owners are especially likely to use their phone during a job search. Compared with smartphone owners from households earning $75,000 or more per year, those from households earning less than $30,000 annually are nearly twice as likely to use a smartphone to look for information about a job — and more than four times as likely to use their phone to actually submit a job application. Similarly, “smartphone-dependent” users are much more likely to use their smartphones to access career opportunities. 63% of these smartphone-dependent users have gotten job information on their phone in the last year, and 39% have used their phone to submit a job application. Young adults (85% of whom are smartphone owners) are also incorporating their mobile devices into a host of information seeking and transactional behaviors. About three-quarters of 18-29 year old smartphone owners have used their phone in the last year to get information about a health condition; about seven-in-ten have used their phone to do online banking or to look up information about job; 44% have consumed educational content on their phone; and 34% have used their phone to apply for a job. A substantial majority of smartphone owners use their phone to follow along with news events near and far, and to share details of local happenings with others: Each of these behaviors is common across a diverse group of smartphone owners. Mobile news consumption is common even among older smartphone owners, who tend to use these devices for more basic activities. Four-in-ten smartphone owners ages 65 and older use their phone at least occasionally to keep up with breaking news, half use it to share information about local happenings, and one-third use it to stay abreast of events and activities in their community. Smartphones also play an important role in helping their owners navigate their environment and get where they need to go, especially as a mobile GPS for real-time driving directions: Each of these behaviors is especially prevalent among younger smartphone owners: for instance, 17% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 use their phone to reserve a taxi or car service at least occasionally. Additionally, African American and Latino smartphone owners look up public transit information on their phones at higher rates than whites (37% of black smartphone owners, 30% of Latinos, and 21% of whites do this at least on occasion). When asked to choose from a series of statements representing how they feel about their phone, a substantial majority of smartphone owners feel that these devices are “helpful” rather than “annoying,” “connecting” rather than “distracting,” and that they represent “freedom” rather than a “leash.” At the same time, smartphone owners are relatively divided on the essential necessity of mobile connectivity: \t\t54% say that their phone is “not always needed,” while 46% say that it is something they “couldn’t live without.”  \t\t And while a substantial 80% majority of smartphone owners describe their phone as “worth the cost,” 19% — and 29% of those who pay more than $200 per month for service — describe it as a “financial burden.” In addition to the surveys of smartphone owners that form the main findings of this report, the Pew Research Center also conducted an “experience sampling” survey of smartphone owners as part of this project. In the experience sampling survey, smartphone owners were contacted twice a day over a period of one week and asked how they had used their phone in the hour prior to taking the survey. This analysis offers new insights into how smartphone owners interact with their mobile devices on a day-to-day basis: the features and apps they use; the locations where that use happens; the issues or problems they use their phones to solve; and the emotions they feel as a result. Fully 97% of smartphone owners used text messaging at least once over the course of the study period, making it the most widely-used basic feature or app; it is also the feature that is used most frequently, as the smartphone owners in this study reported having used text messaging in the past hour in an average of seven surveys (out of a maximum total of 14 across the one-week study period). Younger smartphone owners are especially avid users of text messaging, but this group has by no means abandoned voice calls — 93% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 used voice or video calling on at least one occasion during the study period, and reported doing so in an average of 3.9 surveys. Email has long ranked as one of the most common activities that users take part in online since the desktop/laptop era, and it continues to play a prominent role in the mobile era as well. Some 88% of smartphone owners used email on their phone at least once over the course of the study period, making email a more widely-used smartphone feature than social networking, watching video, or using maps and navigation, among others. Three smartphone features in particular — social networking, watching video, and listening to music or podcasts — are especially popular with younger users. Fully 91% of smartphone owners ages 18-29 used social networking on their phone at least once over the course of the study period, compared with 55% of those 50 and older (a 36-point difference). These young smartphone owners reported using social networking in an average of 5.6 surveys, tied with internet use as the second-most frequent smartphone behavior among young adults after text messaging. Features such as watching video and listening to music or podcasts are even more the domain of young smartphone owners. Three-quarters of younger smartphone owners (75%) indicated using their phone to watch videos at least once over the study period, compared with 31% of those 50 and older (a difference of 44 percentage points). And 64% of younger adults used their phones at one time or another to listen to music or podcasts — a 43-point difference compared with the 21% of older users who did so. Younger users stand out especially prominently when it comes to using their phone for two purposes in particular: avoiding boredom, and avoiding people around them. Fully 93% of 18-29 year old smartphone owners in the experience sampling study used their phone at least once to avoid being bored, with respondents in this age group reporting that they did so in average of 5.4 surveys over the one-week study period. Similarly, 47% of young smartphone owners used their phone to avoid interacting with the people around them at least once during the study period, roughly three times the proportion of older smartphone owners who did so. When it comes to the emotions that people experience as a result of having a smartphone, “productive” and “happy” lead the way — 79% and 77% of smartphone owners, respectively, indicated that their phone made them feel this way at least once over the course of the study period. But smartphones do not always inspire positive feelings, as 57% of smartphone owners reported feeling “distracted” thanks to their phone, and 36% reported that their phone made them feel “frustrated.” Younger smartphone owners tend to experience a wider range of these emotions compared with older users — they are more likely to report feeling positive emotions like “happy” or “grateful,” but also more likely to report negative emotions like “distracted” and “angry.” This report is based on data from three different sources, each of which is discussed in more detail below. Basic findings on smartphone ownership and demographics within the U.S. adult population (the first section of Chapter One) are based on telephone surveys conducted December 4-7 and 18-21, 2014 among 2,002 adults. These figures for overall smartphone ownership/usage were collected via telephone survey to make them consistent with past Pew Research Center measurements of smartphone adoption. The margin of error for the total sample of 2,002 adults is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix A. Findings about how smartphone owners use their phones (the remainder of Chapter One, and Chapter Two) are drawn from the October wave of the American Trends Panel, conducted October 3-27, 2014 among 3,181 respondents (2,875 by Web and 306 by mail), including 2,188 smartphone owners. The margin of sampling error for the total sample of 2,188 smartphone owners is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix B. Data about how smartphone owners use their phones over the course of one week (Chapter 3) is taken from the American Trends Panel “experience sampling” survey, conducted November 10-16, 2014 among 1,635 respondents. Respondents were asked to complete two surveys per day for seven days (14 in total), using either an app they had installed on their phone (n=697) or by completing a web survey (n=938). All findings in this report are based on respondents who completed 10 or more surveys over the course of the week-long study period (n=1,035). The margin of sampling error for smartphone owners who completed 10 or more surveys is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. For more details about this survey, see Appendix C.","At the same time , smartphone owners are relatively divided on the essential necessity of mobile connectivity : 54 % say that their phone is “ not always needed , ” while 46 % say that it is something they “ could n’t live without . ”","How do Americans perceive the importance of the smartphone in their lives?","Smartphone owners are relatively divided on the essential necessity of mobile connectivity : 54 % say that their phone is “ not always needed , ” while 46 % say that it is something they “ could n’t live without . ”","smartphone owners are relatively divided on the essential necessity of mobile connectivity : 54 % say that their phone is “ not always needed , ” while 46 % say that it is something they “ could n’t live without . ”"]}
