Compared with seniors, younger adults are more inclined to like trying new technology products.

And while men and women have similar preferences, index scores suggest that men under age 50 are more likely than either older men or women at any age to prefer new technology products. Technology products have typically come on the market with a high price tag that is out of reach for many consumers.

Changes in unemployment during the recession reveal a rapidly worsening situation for foreign - born Hispanics, native - born Hispanics and blacks in the labor market. The unemployment rates for these groups increased by similar amounts from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008.

( For example, about 10 % of members in the first and much smaller Congress of 1789 - 91 were foreign born. About a century later, in the 50th Congress of 1887 - 89, 8 % of members were born abroad, according to a previous analysis. ) The current share of foreign - born lawmakers in Congress is also far below the foreign - born share of the United States as a whole, which was 13.5 % as of 2016.
