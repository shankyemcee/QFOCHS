7017,"Question: What is the difference in the immigration rate of Mexicans to the United States between the periods 1995 to 2000 and 2005 to 2010? Context: The sharp downward trend in net migration from Mexico began about five years ago and has led to the first significant decrease in at least two decades in the unauthorized Mexican population . As of 2011 , some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. , down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007 , according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Over the same period , the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly , from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011 . The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five - year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five - year period of 1995 to 2000 . Meantime , the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million , roughly double the number who had done so in the five - year period a decade before . While it is not possible to say so with certainty , the trend lines within this latest five - year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two . <s> Figure 1.2  <s> Five- Mexico, Year Migration Flows Between the U.S. and  <s> Mexico, (in thousands) 1995- 2000 and 2005- 2010  <s> Mexico, (in thousands) 1995-  <s> su, to Mexico Mexico to U.S.  <s> 1995 to 2000  <s> 2005 to 2000  <s> 2,940  <s> 1,390  <s> 1,370  <s> 670  <s> Note: Estimates are for February 1995 through February 2000 and June 2005  <s> throug the U, S.1 I June and 2010 elsewhere; Migration Mexico from U.S U.S to includes Mexico Mexican-born includes persons persons born in Mexico,  <s> throug the U, S.1 June and 2010 elsewhere; Migration Mexico from to U.S U.S to includes Mexico Mexican-born includes persons persons born only. in Mexico,  <s> Source: U.S to Mexico: Pew Hispanic les ofMexican Center estimates of from 2000 population, and 2010; Mexico household  <s> Source: and U, S.I migrant U.S micro to Pew Mexico: data Hispanic samp Pew Hispanic les Center ofMexican Center censuses estimates Figure of from 2000 1.3 from population, and 2010; Mexico household to  <s> U, S.I Methodology Based on Pew Hispanic Center estimates in Figure 1.3 from various sources;  <s> see Methodology  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years .

Context: Although he has only been in office a few months , Donald Trump ’s presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States . Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe , and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations . According to a new Pew Research Center survey spanning 37 nations , a median of just 22 % has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs . This stands in contrast to the final years of Barack Obama ’s presidency , when a median of 64 % expressed confidence in Trump ’s predecessor to direct America ’s role in the world . The sharp decline in how much global publics trust the U.S. president on the world stage is especially pronounced among some of America ’s closest allies in Europe and Asia , as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada . Across the 37 nations polled , Trump gets higher marks than Obama in only two countries : Russia and Israel . In countries where confidence in the U.S. president fell most , America ’s overall image has also tended to suffer more .

Context: As Congress comes to a decision on whether to give President Barack Obama broad negotiating powers on trade , our new Pew Research Center report shows that while Americans favor the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , they are among the least likely to support it in the nine TPP nations surveyed . And , as with many issues in the U.S. , there is a partisan divide on support for TPP . Overall , 49 % of Americans say that TPP would be a good thing for their country , while 29 % think it would be a bad thing . When the survey was administered in April and May , the debate over giving Obama fast - track authority — which would enhance his ability to negotiate TPP without fear of it being modified by Congress — had not yet gained the full attention of Americans . Consequently , 12 % volunteered that they had not heard enough about TPP to make a judgment , and a further 9 % did not answer the question . In general , Americans see free trade agreements as good for the country . However , support for this free trade agreement is much more robust in most other TPP nations surveyed . This includes two - thirds or more of Vietnamese ( 89 % good thing ) , Peruvians ( 70 % ) and Chileans ( 67 % ) . And at least half or more in Mexico ( 61 % ) , Japan ( 53 % ) , Australia ( 52 % ) and Canada ( 52 % ) also support the deal .

6386,"Question: Describe the surge in holiday jobs. Context: Much of that increase , however , is concentrated in a handful of retail sectors . Last year , for example , nearly a third of the retail employment surge ( 202,400 jobs ) occurred at clothing and accessories stores , and more than a quarter ( 177,400 jobs ) at department stores . The pattern appeared to continue last month : Clothiers and department stores accounted for more than half of November ’s retail job gains , adding 121,600 and 114,700 jobs respectively . Other good places to seek holiday employment were general merchandise stores ( 78,600 jobs added between October and December 2013 , about 13 % of the total increase ) and sporting goods , hobby , book and music retailers ( 65,800 jobs , or 11 % of last season ’s total increase ) . Those patterns have n’t changed much over the past decade , though department stores account for less of the seasonal surge than they used to ( as well as a smaller share of retail employment generally ) and clothing / accessories stores account for more . While the pre - holiday hiring surge is impressive , the post - holiday drop is even more dramatic . Retail payrolls typically fall 5 % to 6 % between December and February , as retailers with disappointing holiday sales lay off staff and close unprofitable stores . ( This past year , retailers shed a combined 880,000 jobs in the two months after Christmas . ) For some struggling retailers , a bad holiday season can be the final push over the ledge : Circuit City announced in January 2009 it was closing down ; Borders filed for bankruptcy in February 2011 . <s> Where the Holiday Jobs Are  <s> Change in number of retail sector jobs Oct. 2013-Feb 2014, by subsector (in thousands)  <s> OCT-DEC  <s> DEC --FEB  <s> Clothing and clothing accessories stores  <s> 202. 4  <s> 234.1  <s> 177 4  <s> Department stores  <s> -197 3  <s> General merchanise stores  <s> 78.6  <s> 96.4  <s> 65.8  <s> Sporting goods hobby, book and music stores  <s> 98.5  <s> Food and beverage stores  <s> 52.9  <s> 36.1  <s> Electronics and appliance stores  <s> 29.2  <s> --42.6  <s> Nonstore reta ilers  <s> 26.9  <s> 40.9  <s> Furniture and home furnishings stores  <s> 23.8  <s> 30.3  <s> 17.6  <s> 39. 3  <s> Health and personal care stores  <s> 2.0  <s> Automo bile dealers  <s> 1.3  <s> Motor vehicle and parts dealers  <s> 5.6  <s> 4.0  <s> Miscellaneous store retailers  <s> 4.2  <s> 23.5  <s> Gasoline stations  <s> -7.9  <s> -14.6  <s> Building material and garden supply stores  <s> --6 8  <s> -14.0  <s> TOTAL  <s> +626.2  <s> --888.0  <s> Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","nearly a third of the retail employment surge ( 202,400 jobs ) occurred at clothing and accessories stores , and more than a quarter ( 177,400 jobs ) at department stores .

Context: Driven in part by a highly competitive presidential primary season , cable news saw its viewership jump 8 % , to an average of 3.1 million viewers in prime time ( according to Pew Research Center analysis of Nielsen Media Research data , used under license ) .

2371,"Question: Compare the trust Americans have in various societal groups? Context: It is important to keep in mind that public beliefs about science and scientists are n’t necessarily indicators of trust , per se . One example involves public support for the products of scientific and technological innovation . A Pew Research Center survey found that about two - thirds of people see the effects of science on society as mostly positive , which is consistent with some 35 years of data from the General Social Survey . Looking at the components of trust in science across these three scientific areas — vaccines , climate change , and GM food — two patterns stand out . First , public trust in scientists is stronger , by comparison , than it is for several other groups in society . For example , many more people report trust in information from medical scientists , climate scientists , and GM food scientists than information from industry leaders , the news media , and elected officials . On the other hand , no more than about half of people hold strongly trusting views of scientists in any of these domains . For example , only 47 % of people say that medical scientists understand the health effects of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine “ very well . ” Some 43 % hold soft positive views of medical understanding about the MMR vaccine , saying medical scientists understand this issue “ fairly well . ” Public confidence in scientists is relatively strong compared with trust in other institutional groups . Only the military earns more confidence from the public . Still , people seem guarded . No more than a third of people report a “ great deal ” of confidence in any of these groups to act in the public interest . Overall , more people express positive than negative confidence in scientists , but a 55 % majority express only a soft confidence in scientists to act in the public interest . Public trust in scientists as sources of information is generally higher than it is for any of several other groups in society . For example , far more people trust medical scientists to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of childhood vaccines than they trust information from pharmaceutical industry leaders , the news media , or elected officials . The same pattern occurs for public trust in information from climate scientists and from GM food scientists . <s> Americans' trust in military, scientists relatively high;  <s> trust in media, business leaders, elected officials low  <s> % of USS adults who say they have of confidence in each of the  <s> following groups to act in the best interests of the public  <s> Not too No  <s> great deal  <s> a fair amount  <s> much confidence  <s> The military  <s> 33%  <s> 46%  <s> 15%  <s> Scientists  <s> 21  <s> 18  <s> 55  <s> K-12 principals and  <s> 13  <s> 27  <s> 53  <s> superintendents  <s> Religious leaders  <s> 13  <s> 32  <s> 39  <s> 14  <s> The news media  <s> 33  <s> 40  <s> 21  <s> Business leaders  <s> 37  <s> 44  <s> 14  <s> Elected officials  <s> 19  <s> 24  <s> 54  <s> Note: Those who gave other responses or who did not give an answer are not shown  <s> Source: Survey of U.S adults conducted May 10-June 6, 2016  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","No more than a third of people report a “ great deal ” of confidence in any of these groups to act in the public interest .

Context: New data show that median household income has stagnated for the longest period since the government began collecting such data in 1967 . In 2012 the median household income was $ 51,017 , still below the pre - recession 2007 level ( $ 55,627 ) and also below the all - time peak level reached in 1999 ( $ 56,080 ) . So the typical American household had 9 % less income in 2012 than it did 13 years earlier ( all figures adjusted for inflation ) . The 2012 level is just above where it had stood as of 1995 ( $ 50,978 ) . Households headed by those 65 and older are faring relatively better since the recession . The income patterns of younger and older households have moved in opposite directions in recent years . The median incomes of households headed by those 65 and older have risen during the recession and recovery , continuing their steady rise over more than four decades .

Context: The controversy over the firing of eight U.S. attorneys is not attracting strong public interest in spite of intense media coverage of the story . In fact , the story evokes a typical response from the public when compared with news interest in past Washington scandals . Amid calls for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’ resignation , the news media ’s coverage of the story outstripped public interest .

The news media devoted 16 % of its coverage overall to the firings – an eight - fold increase over the week of March 5 – making it the most covered story of the week .

Nearly as many ( 31 % ) followed news about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and more general stories about problems with medical care for wounded soldiers returning from Iraq .

6513,"Question: Compare the projected population shares of Muslims and Hindus in India. Context: Muslims are expected to grow faster than Hindus because they have the youngest median age and the highest fertility rates among major religious groups in India . In 2010 , the median age of Indian Muslims was 22 , compared with 26 for Hindus and 28 for Christians . Likewise , Muslim women have an average of 3.2 children per woman , compared with 2.5 for Hindus and 2.3 for Christians . Due to these factors , India ’s Muslim community will expand faster than its Hindu population , rising from 14.4 % in 2010 to 18.4 % in 2050 . But , even with this increase , Hindus will make up more than three - in - four Indians ( 76.7 % ) in 2050 . Indeed , the number of Hindus in India will still be larger than the five largest Muslim populations in the world ’s biggest Muslim countries ( India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Nigeria and Bangladesh ) combined . India also has a number of smaller religious minorities . In 2010 , approximately 2.5 % of the country ’s population was Christian , including members of Scheduled Castes ( historically referred to as Untouchables or Dalits ) who sometimes identify as Hindu when completing official forms . Christians are expected to make up 2.2 % of India ’s population in 2050 . Religious turmoil ( between Muslims and Hindus , but also involving Sikhs , Christians and others ) has long been a fact of life in India . The year the country won its independence from Britain , the Indian subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines , into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India . Even though the separation was intended to ease religious tensions , it led to a spasm of violence that left up to a million dead and more than 10 million displaced . <s> Religious Composition of India  <s> Projected share of the population, 2010-2050  <s> 100%  <s> Hindu  <s> 80  <s> 76.7%  <s> 60  <s> 40  <s> Muslim  <s> 18.4%  <s> 20  <s> Other  <s> 2.7%  <s> Christian  <s> '50 Christian 2.2%  <s> 2010  <s> 20  <s> 30  <s> '40  <s> Note: Other includes Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains Jews, adherents  <s> of folk religions and those with no re ligious affiliation.  <s> Source: The Future of World Re ligions: Population Growth  <s> Projections, 2010-2050.  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","India ’s Muslim community will expand faster than its Hindu population , rising from 14.4 % in 2010 to 18.4 % in 2050 .

7660,"Question: Whose news was mostly shown among the presidential candidates and explain it? Context: Throughout the first three months of the year , Obama and Clinton have been far more visible than the other presidential candidates , and this overwhelming focus on the Democratic contest continues . In the current poll , Obama is by far the candidate that the public has been hearing the most about in the news . Fully , 70 % have heard more about Obama in the last week than any other candidate . This is consistent with the balance of the press coverage , according to the Campaign Coverage Index conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism . Last week , Obama was the featured news maker in 72 % of all campaign news stories , his highest coverage level this year . Only 15 % said that Sen. Clinton was the candidate they have been hearing the most about . The gap between Obama ’s and Clinton ’s visibility has grown substantially over the last two weeks from roughly equal visibility in early March , when 38 % had been hearing most about Obama , 37 % about Clinton . The drop in Clinton ’s public visibility is also consistent with the amount of coverage her campaign received in recent weeks . The share of campaign coverage in which Clinton was the featured candidate fell from 60 % three weeks ago to 51 % in the following week and down to 30 % this past week , according to the Campaign Coverage Index conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism . Though John McCain has sewn up the Republican nomination , he continues to lag far behind Obama and Clinton in public visibility . Only 3 % of the public named John McCain as the candidate they heard most about in the news recently .

Context: The employment landscape in the U.S. has undergone profound changes , and the public is adapting to the new realities of the workplace and rethinking the skills they need to compete . A new Pew Research Center survey , conducted in association with the Markle Foundation , and analysis of government data finds that employment in occupations requiring more education and training is on the rise , and many workers are realizing that retraining and upgrading their skills needs to be a lifetime commitment .

Employment in these jobs increased from 50 million to 65 million over the same time period . Employment and wages have increased most in occupations that require higher social or analytical skills . While employment grew by 50 % over all occupations from 1980 to 2015 , this growth was much higher among jobs that require average or above average social skills ( 83 % ) , such as interpersonal , management and communication skills , and those that require higher levels of analytical skills ( 77 % ) , such as critical thinking and computer skills .

Context: But perhaps just as striking is that the geographic distribution of the poor has changed dramatically , too . A new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that the South continues to be home to many of America ’s poor , though to a lesser degree than a half - century ago . In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South . By 2010 , that share had dropped to 41 % . Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period . As rural areas , such as in the Midwest , have become less impoverished since the 1960s , those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall . At the same time , urban centers have gained in total population and hold a greater share of the U.S. population overall . <s> Nation's Poor Population Is Less  <s> Southern, More Urban Than in 1960  <s> Share of nation's impoverished population  <s> BY CENSUS REGION  <s> South  <s> West  <s> Midwest Northeast  <s> 2010  <s> 41%  <s> 23%  <s> 21%  <s> 15%  <s> 1960  <s> 49  <s> 11  <s> 23  <s> 16  <s> BY COUNTY POPULATION  <s> <100K  <s> 100K-1M  <s> 1M or more  <s> 25%  <s> 47%  <s> 28%  <s> 2010  <s> 1960  <s> 53  <s> 34  <s> 12  <s> Note: Figures may not add to 100% beca use of rounding  <s> Source: Pew Research Conter analysis of 2012 rounding American  <s> Community Survey (5 year estimates) and 1960 decennial  <s> census  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South ."

Context: With a presidential election just over a week away , a new survey finds that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s support has declined sharply in his home country and around the Middle East . Over a year after protests rocked Istanbul and other major cities in Turkey , the survey also finds many Turks disapprove of Erdogan ’s handling of them . The anti - government demonstrations were in response to plans to build Ottoman - style military barracks with a shopping mall and luxury hotels within Gezi Park , a popular green space in Istanbul . In Turkey , only about half ( 51 % ) have a positive view of their prime minister , down 11 percentage points from 2013 . In all , 55 % disapprove of his handling of Gezi Park protests , while just 37 % approve . Despite all this , Erdogan is a heavy favorite going into next month ’s presidential election because of strong support from his dominant Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) and a long record of economic growth in Turkey . Amid continued unrest in Syria , Iraq , Israel and the Palestinian territories , support for Erdogan has dropped significantly in four of the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed since last year . For example , last year , 75 % in Jordan had a favorable view of Erdogan , but in the current poll it is only 60 % . Support dropped even further in Egypt ( -26 points ) .

CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four - in - ten web - using U.S. adults .

Context: New Zealand has some of the lowest levels of government restrictions on religion in the world , with a score in 2016 of just 0.48 out of 10 on Pew Research Center ’s Government Restrictions Index ( GRI ) . Still , while New Zealand ’s GRI score has been low since we first began measuring it in 2007 , it did tick upwards slightly in 2016 . This recent increase is due in part to derogatory statements made by Winston Peters , leader of the New Zealand First Party , when he said in June 2016 that certain countries “ treat their women like cattle , ” and suggested that all immigrants should be screened for unacceptable attitudes before being permitted to enter the country . Some media reports said he specifically referred to Muslim immigrants , which he denied . New Zealand had “ low ” levels of social hostilities involving religion in 2016 ( with a Social Hostilities Index score of 0.9 out of 10 ) . There have been incidents of religiously motivated violence and hostilities in the past , although these cases have been relatively rare .

About 75 % of college - educated 25- to 35 - year - olds ( 75 % for men and 74 % for women ) had worked for their employer at least 13 months in 2016 . Back in 2000 , somewhat fewer college - educated Gen X women ( 70 % ) had been on the job that long . Among college - educated Gen X men , 72 % had similar tenure . The increasing job tenure of college - educated Millennials is consistent with a decline in employer switching among all working - age adults since the 1980s . The reasons for the decline are not well understood . Recent research indicates that the rise of dual - career households , the decline in middle - skill jobs , occupational licensing and the need for employees to retain health insurance can not account for much of the decline in job - switching .

Context: Republicans have recently turned negative in their assessments of the impact of colleges and universities , and a new survey finds that they also have a skeptical view of college professors . More Republicans offer a cold than warm view of professors on a “ feeling thermometer ” scale ranging from 0 to 100 , with an average rating of 46 . The Pew Research Center survey , conducted on the American Trends Panel in August , asks the public to rate a number of groups on a “ feeling thermometer ” from 0 to 100 , where 0 is the coldest , most negative rating and 100 is the warmest , most positive . Overall , about half of the public ( 49 % ) gives college professors at least a somewhat warm rating , including a third ( 33 % ) who rate professors very warmly . Fewer ( 24 % ) give professors a cold rating , while 26 % have a neutral view of professors . Democrats have a broadly positive view of college professors . About two - thirds ( 66 % ) give professors a warm rating , while just 7 % offer a cold rating and 24 % express a neutral view . Liberal Democrats are more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to rate professors warmly , though majorities of both groups do so ( 76 % and 56 % , respectively ) . Views among Republicans are much chillier : 43 % give cold ratings to college professors , including about a quarter ( 27 % ) who give a very cold rating .

Context: A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time . But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies , Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago . Roughly three - quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day . These shares are identical to those reported by Facebook users in the Center ’s 2018 social media use survey . Majorities of Snapchat and Instagram users also say they visit these sites daily , though they are slightly less likely than Facebook users to do so . The shares of young adults using these platforms daily are especially large . Roughly eight - in - ten Snapchat users ages 18 to 29 ( 77 % ) say they use the app every day , including 68 % who say they do so multiple times day . Similarly , 76 % of Instagram users in this age group visit the site on a daily basis , with 60 % reporting that they do so several times per day .

Context: The gender gap in 2008 – the seven - point difference between women and men in support for the Democratic candidate – was comparable to the gap in most elections since 1980 . Even when Democratic candidates failed to garner a majority of the women ’s vote – as in 1980 , 1984 and 1988 – they still drew more support from women than from men . The election of 1992 was unusual because of Ross Perot ’s popular third - party campaign . Still , the gender gap was significant : Women backed Bill Clinton over George H.W. Bush , 45 % to 37 % , with 17 % supporting Perot .

6245,"Question: Describe the distribution of political party registration among Florida Hispanic registered voters in 2016. Context: Florida has long been a battleground state in presidential elections , with Hispanic voters playing a growing role in determining the outcome of the state ’s presidential vote . Hispanic voters this year make up an even larger share of the state ’s registered voters than in past years , but the profile of the Latino electorate has shifted over the past decade or so , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state voter registration data . Due to the state ’s large Cuban voting bloc , the Latino vote had been reliably Republican . For example , President George W. Bush won both the Hispanic vote and the state in 2004 . But 2008 represented a tipping point : More Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans , and the gap has only widened since then . This has led to the growing influence of Democrats among the state ’s Hispanic voters in 2008 and 2012 , two presidential elections in which Barack Obama carried both Hispanics and the state . At the same time , the number of Latino registered voters in Florida who indicate no party affiliation has also grown rapidly during this time , and by 2012 had surpassed Republican registrations . Among all Floridians , registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in 2016 . This is due in part to Hispanics , who accounted for 88 % of growth in the number of registered Democrats between 2006 and 2016 . During this time , the number of Hispanic registered voters increased by 61 % , while the number of Hispanics identifying as Democrats increased by 83 % and those having no party affiliation increased by 95 % . The number of Hispanic Republican registered voters has grown too – but much more slowly ( just 16 % ) . As a result , among Hispanic registered voters in 2016 , 678,000 were registered as Democrats , 610,000 indicated no party affiliation and 479,000 were registered as Republicans . ( It ’s worth noting that not all registered voters cast a ballot , and voter turnout has a large impact in swing states like Florida . ) <s> Democrats hold voter  <s> registration advantage  <s> among Florida Hispanics  <s> Political party registrations,  <s> in thousands  <s> 678  <s> Democrats  <s> 610  <s> 479  <s> 414  <s> Republicans  <s> 370  <s> No affiliation party  <s> 313  <s> affiliation  <s> '06 '08 '10 '12 '14 '16  <s> Note: 2016 data reflect presidential  <s> primary book-closing numbers; presidential 2014  <s> and book-closing earlier data re flect general election  <s> book-closing numbers.

Context: President Donald Trump ’s prolific Twitter output has become source material for news outlets covering him – and during the early days of his administration , stories that included his tweets stood out from those that did not . They were more likely to have a negative assessment of the administration ’s words and actions and to include a challenge by the journalist to something Trump or a member of his administration said , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of more than 3,000 stories across 24 media outlets . A recent report from the Center found that about one - in - six news stories about the president or the administration ( 16 % ) during the first 100 days of Trump ’s presidency included one of his tweets . Another element measured in the study was whether statements from the journalist or statements cited in a story gave an overall positive or negative evaluation of the Trump administration ’s words or actions – or fell somewhere in between . This deeper analysis reveals that the stories that included a direct tweet from Trump were more likely than others to have an overall negative assessment of him or his administration – that is , had at least twice as many negative as positive statements .

6521,"Question: Describe the partisan advantages of various generations. Context: But generations cover a long period of time . Generations typically encompass a cohort of people born over a 15- to-18 - year span ; for example , the Baby Boom generation includes people born between 1946 and 1964 . As a result , the formative political experiences of the youngest and oldest members of each generation can differ considerably , and these differences may be reflected in divergent political attitudes and partisanship within generations .

6255,"Question: Describe the ethnic demographics of U.S. babies. Context: Two years ago , the Census Bureau announced the nation had reached a new demographic tipping point : The share of U.S. babies who were a racial or ethnic minority had edged past the 50 % mark for the first time . The finding was widely covered as a dramatic illustration of the agency ’s projections that the U.S. will become a majority - minority nation within three decades . But that tipping point may not have arrived yet , according to preliminary 2013 birth data released last week by the National Center for Health Statistics . The center ’s numbers indicate that non - Hispanic white mothers still account for 54 % of births — as they had in 2012 and 2011 . The Census Bureau ’s initial announcement was that members of minority groups — defined as anyone who is not non - Hispanic white — accounted for 50.4 % of the U.S. population younger than age 1 on July 1 , 2011 . The bureau ’s annual population estimates for July 1 , 2012 , placed the minority share at 50.1 % . The agency ’s annual population estimate for July 1 , 2013 , is to be released June 26 . In recent decades , non - Hispanic whites have been a shrinking share of newborns in data produced by both agencies . To some extent , the data discrepancy between them reflects differences in what each agency measures : The Census Bureau classifies the children based on the race and Hispanic origin of both parents , while the National Center for Health Statistics reports only the mother ’s race . The two agencies also use somewhat different methods to categorize race . But the bottom line is that people who want to know whether a new era in the nursery has arrived may be scratching their heads wondering which interpretation is correct . <s> Data Differences on Minority Births  <s> % of people younger than age 1 who were in 2012  <s> minorities  <s> non-Hispanic white  <s> U.S. Census Bureau  <s> 49 9%  <s> 50.1%  <s> % of babies born to  <s> non-Hispanic  <s> minority mothers  <s> white mothers  <s> National Center  <s> 46 0%  <s> 54 0%  <s> for Health Statistics  <s> Sources: U.S. Census Bureau; National Center for Health Statistics  <s> U.S Census Bureau data are foryear ending July 1, 2012; NCHS data  <s> are for calendar year 2012.  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ",The share of U.S. babies who were a racial or ethnic minority had edged past the 50 % .

5438,"Question: Describe the shares of adults living in middle-income households among Wester Europe's six largest economies. Context: For the analysis – which covers the period from 1991 to 2010 and includes comparisons with changes in the United States – “ middle - class ” or “ middle - income ” adults in a country are those who live in households with disposable ( after - tax ) incomes ranging from two - thirds to double the country ’s median disposable household income . Thus , the income it takes to be middle class varies across countries . Also , estimates in the new report will not match those in the Center ’s previous reports , which were based on a household ’s gross ( pretax ) income . Among Western Europe ’s six largest economies , the shares of adults living in middle - income households increased in France , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , but they shrank in Germany , Italy and Spain . From 1991 to 2010 , the middle - class share in the UK increased from 61 % to 67 % , but it decreased from 78 % to 72 % in Germany . Among the 11 Western European countries examined , the expansion in the UK was second only to the increase in Ireland , where the share increased from 60 % in 1991 to 69 % in 2010 . The decrease in Germany was the second largest after Finland , where the middle - class share fell from 82 % to 75 % over the same period . Overall , the middle - class share of the adult population fell in seven of the 11 Western European countries examined , mirroring the long - term shrinking of the middle class in the U.S. In most countries studied , decreasing shares of middle - income populations led to rising shares of adults in lower- and upper - income tiers . These shifts signal a sharpening of economic divisions among households in many Western European countries and the U.S. However , there is also a general improvement in the economic status of adults because the movement up the income ladder was greater than the movement downward in most countries from 1991 to 2010 . Compared with Western Europe , the U.S. middle class is smaller . Among the countries examined , the U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six - in - ten adults were in the middle class in 2010 . Meanwhile , compared with many Western European countries , greater shares of Americans were either lower income ( 26 % ) or upper income ( 15 % ) . Thus , U.S. households were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries analyzed . In the Western European countries , middle - class shares in 2010 ranged from 64 % in Spain to 80 % in Denmark and Norway . The share of adults who were lower income was lowest in the Netherlands ( 13 % ) and highest in Spain ( 24 % ) , and upper - income shares ranged from 6 % in Norway to 14 % in the UK . <s> The shares of adults living in middle-income  <s> households fell in many countries in Western Europe  <s> % of adults living in middle- -income households in1991 and 2010  <s> 82%  <s> 81 29  <s> 80 Norway  <s> a 79 Netherlands  <s> 80 Denmark  <s> 75 Luxembourg 76  <s> 074 France  <s> 75 Finland  <s> 720  <s> 72 Germany  <s> 69 69  <s> 069 Ireland  <s> 067 UK  <s> 67 Intaly  <s> 64 Spain  <s> 62  <s> 61  <s> 60  <s> 59 U.S.  <s> 1991  <s> 2010  <s> 1991  <s> 2010  <s> Note: Middle-income households havedisposable incomes thatare two -thirds to doublethe  <s> national median disposal bbe income, after incomes have been adjusted for household size  <s> For some countries disposal the 1991 estimates are from the following survey years Denmark-  <s> 1992 France 1989.

Context: Older Americans are strong supporters of requiring childhood vaccinations – 79 % say they hold that view , compared with 59 % of those under 30 . One possible reason that older groups might be more supportive of mandatory vaccinations is that many among them remember when diseases like measles were common .

Today , measles cases are extremely rare , but the CDC reported a spike in 2014 , with more than 600 measles cases , the first such jump in more than a decade .

However , there is less consensus about the importance of other aspects of a strong democracy – notably , the freedom of news organizations to criticize political leaders . The survey by Pew Research Center , conducted Feb. 7 - 12 among 1,503 adults , finds that 89 % say fair and open national elections are very important to maintaining a strong democracy , while 83 % say the same about a system of checks and balances dividing power between the president , Congress and the courts . As in past surveys , most also view the right to nonviolent protest ( 79 % ) and protecting the rights of those with unpopular views ( 74 % ) as very important components of a strong democracy .

2021,"Question: Describe the accuracy level of telephone survey data. Context: Researchers are , of course , interested in the extent to which nonresponse bias is getting worse over time . Comparing current levels to those measured roughly four years ago , we find that , on average , the accuracy of telephone survey data is at least as high as it was in 2012 . On 13 demographic , lifestyle and health questions11that have high response rate benchmark survey data , the average ( absolute ) difference between the Center telephone estimates and the benchmark survey estimates was 2.7 percentage points in 2016 , compared with 2.8 points in 2012 . In general , accuracy as measured by these benchmarks was lower among certain demographic groups such as young adults and minorities . But there is no indication that the biases within groups got worse over time . Most major subgroups – defined by age , gender , race or education – saw the accuracy of their estimates from phone surveys either stay level or slightly improve . For example , across the 13 lifestyle , health and demographic questions with high response rate comparisons , the average difference between the Hispanic adult estimate from Pew Research Center phone surveys and the same Hispanic estimate from the benchmark survey was 5.5 percentage points in 2016 as compared with 6.7 in 2012 . The average change in accuracy from 2012 to 2016 was similar for non - Hispanic white . For blacks , however , their phone survey estimates differed from benchmark survey estimates by an average of 5.1 percentage points in 2016 versus 4.2 points in 2012 . <s> Accuracy of telephone estimates has held steady  <s> among demographic subgroups  <s> Average absolute difference between weighted telephone survey  <s> estimates from 2012 and 2016 compared to federal benchmark  <s> estimate for the respective years  <s> 2012  <s> 2.8  <s> All adults  <s> 2016  <s> 2.7  <s> 6. 5  <s> 18-29  <s> 3.1  <s> 30-64  <s> 3.4  <s> 3.2  <s> 65+  <s> 2.0  <s> 2012  <s> 2.3  <s> White  <s> 2016  <s> 2.0  <s> 2  <s> Black  <s> Hispanic  <s> 5.5  <s> 2012  <s> HS or less  <s> 2016  <s> 5  <s> 3. 6  <s> Some college  <s> 1.9  <s> College grad  <s> 2.3  <s> 0 Benchmark  <s> Notes: Values reported represent the average of the absolute values of the  <s> differe nces be tween the tele phone survey estimate fand the benchmark survey  <s> estimate on 13 questions  <s> Source: Pew Research Center Surveys in 2012 and 2016.

In the days after the school shooting in Newtown , Conn. last December , more prioritized gun control than gun rights ( 49 % vs. 42 % ) , the first time this had occurred since Barack Obama became president . Roughly five months later , the public is again evenly divided over whether in general it is more important to control gun ownership ( 50 % ) or to protect the rights of Americans to own guns ( 48 % ) .

Context: In Latin America , where nearly 40 % of the world ’s Catholics live , Protestant populations have risen sharply . In a survey conducted in the region in 2014 , 9 % of respondents across 19 Latin American countries said they were raised as Protestants , while 19 % identified Protestant ( or evangelical ) Christianity as their current religion . Net gains for Protestants in Latin America have meant net losses for Catholics . While 84 % of respondents were raised as Catholic , only 69 % identified their current religion as Catholic . Protestants across Latin America also are significantly more religious than Catholics . And they are more likely to take conservative positions on issues such as divorce , abortion , gay marriage and gender norms . One relatively recent and distinctive Protestant movement that has gained ground globally is Pentecostalism . While practices vary , Pentecostal churches often emphasize the “ gifts of the Holy Spirit , ” such as divine healing , speaking in tongues and receiving direct revelations from God . These practices are common among Protestants in sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America and even in Asia .

The share of Democrats who say they sympathize more with Israel is down 10 points from April 2016 .

5818,"Question: What is the opinion of U.S adults about transgender individuals using public restrooms ? Context: As the visibility of transgender Americans has increased in recent years , it has been accompanied by a contentious political debate over the rights of the estimated 0.6 % of U.S. adults who identify as transgender – in particular , which public restrooms they should legally be allowed to enter . About half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) say transgender individuals should be allowed to use public restrooms that correspond with the gender they currently identify with , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . But nearly as many ( 46 % ) take the opposite position – on the side of the North Carolina law – and say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms that match the gender they were born into . Religion , age , gender and politics are all connected with views on this issue . For instance , a majority of Americans who say they attend religious services at least weekly – especially white evangelicals – say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms of their gender at birth , while most of those who attend services less often ( particularly people who do not identify with any religion ) take the more liberal position that such individuals should be allowed to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity . Also , more women than men take the liberal stance ( 55 % vs. 45 % ) as do young adults when compared with older Americans ( 67 % of those ages 18 to 29 , compared with about half or fewer in older age groups ) . In addition , those who are Democrats or who lean Democratic are far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners ( 68 % vs. 30 % ) to say transgender people should be able to use the bathroom that fits their gender identity . <s> Most young adults favor allowing transgender people  <s> to use restrooms of their current gender identity  <s> If you had to choose, which comes closest to your view?  <s> Transgender people should be  <s> allowed to muse the  <s> required to use  <s> public restrooms of  <s> public restrooms of  <s> they public gender with which identify  <s> public gender they were  <s> No  <s> they currently identify  <s> born finto  <s> answer  <s> Total  <s> 51%  <s> 46%  <s> 3%  <s> 45  <s> 52  <s> Men  <s> Women  <s> 55  <s> 40  <s> White  <s> 51  <s> 46  <s> Black  <s> 50  <s> 44  <s> Hispanic  <s> 47  <s> 48  <s> Ages 18-29  <s> 67  <s> 32  <s> 30-49  <s> 49  <s> 49  <s> 50-64  <s> 44  <s> 52  <s> 65+  <s> 45  <s> 48  <s> Note: Whites and blacks include only those who are not Hispanic.
