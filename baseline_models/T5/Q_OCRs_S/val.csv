Context: The survey finds that majorities of both whites and blacks say Baltimore City State ’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby made the right decision in bringing criminal charges against some Baltimore police officers , including a charge of second - degree murder against one of the officers . Overall , 65 % say the decision by the state ’s attorney to charge the officers was right , while 16 % see it as the wrong decision ; 18 % do not offer an opinion . The question was asked May 1 - 3 among 798 adults . ( Mosby announced the charges on May 1 . ) Nearly eight - in - ten blacks ( 78 % ) and 60 % of whites say the decision to bring charges was right .

Fully 74 % of Americans say they have given a lot or some thought to the candidates , higher than the shares saying this at comparable points in the past two presidential campaigns . The presidential debates clearly have been a hit with the public . Nearly seven - in - ten ( 69 % ) say they have watched at least some of the televised debates between the candidates .

2130,"Question: How did Blacks phone survey estimates differ from benchmark estimates? Context: Researchers are , of course , interested in the extent to which nonresponse bias is getting worse over time . Comparing current levels to those measured roughly four years ago , we find that , on average , the accuracy of telephone survey data is at least as high as it was in 2012 . On 13 demographic , lifestyle and health questions11that have high response rate benchmark survey data , the average ( absolute ) difference between the Center telephone estimates and the benchmark survey estimates was 2.7 percentage points in 2016 , compared with 2.8 points in 2012 . In general , accuracy as measured by these benchmarks was lower among certain demographic groups such as young adults and minorities . But there is no indication that the biases within groups got worse over time . Most major subgroups – defined by age , gender , race or education – saw the accuracy of their estimates from phone surveys either stay level or slightly improve . For example , across the 13 lifestyle , health and demographic questions with high response rate comparisons , the average difference between the Hispanic adult estimate from Pew Research Center phone surveys and the same Hispanic estimate from the benchmark survey was 5.5 percentage points in 2016 as compared with 6.7 in 2012 . The average change in accuracy from 2012 to 2016 was similar for non - Hispanic white . For blacks , however , their phone survey estimates differed from benchmark survey estimates by an average of 5.1 percentage points in 2016 versus 4.2 points in 2012 . <s> Accuracy of telephone estimates has held steady  <s> among demographic subgroups  <s> Average absolute difference between weighted telephone survey  <s> estimates from 2012 and 2016 compared to federal benchmark  <s> estimate for the respective years  <s> 2012  <s> 2.8  <s> All adults  <s> 2016  <s> 2.7  <s> 6. 5  <s> 18-29  <s> 3.1  <s> 30-64  <s> 3.4  <s> 3.2  <s> 65+  <s> 2.0  <s> 2012  <s> 2.3  <s> White  <s> 2016  <s> 2.0  <s> 2  <s> Black  <s> Hispanic  <s> 5.5  <s> 2012  <s> HS or less  <s> 2016  <s> 5  <s> 3. 6  <s> Some college  <s> 1.9  <s> College grad  <s> 2.3  <s> 0 Benchmark  <s> Notes: Values reported represent the average of the absolute values of the  <s> differe nces be tween the tele phone survey estimate fand the benchmark survey  <s> estimate on 13 questions  <s> Source: Pew Research Center Surveys in 2012 and 2016.

4267,"Question: What are the trends in people being displaced from their homes since 1951? Context: More than 60 million people are displaced from their homes as of the end of 2015 , the highest number of displaced people since World War II , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) . This group accounts for 0.8 % of the world ’s population , or nearly 1 in 100 people globally , and represents the highest share of the world ’s population that has been forcibly displaced since UNHCR began collecting data on displaced persons in 1951 . The UNHCR defines displaced persons as those who have been forced to leave their homes . This includes those who still live in their country of birth ( internally displaced persons ) as well as those who left for a different country ( refugees and asylum seekers ) and have yet to resettle permanently .

5026,"Question: Describe trends in apprehensions at US and Mexico border? Context: Striking seasonal fluctuations are apparent in the apprehension data ( Figure 11 ) . The highest numbers of apprehensions are recorded from February to May as migrants move north for the construction and harvesting seasons . Meanwhile the lowest numbers of apprehensions are registered in November and December when many unauthorized migrants travel south for the holidays . That seasonal pattern has remained consistent for many years , regardless of whether the total number of apprehensions for the entire year is up or down . Looking back to the start of the decade , for example , the highest number of apprehensions has occurred in March of every year . From 2004 to 2006 , monthly apprehensions during the peak months leveled off at about 150,000 . The latest data , for March 2007 , shows the number of apprehensions declined to about 114,000 .

5837,"Question: Describe some details about Excluding flagged-inactive cellphone numbers reduces sample coverage of U.S. adults? Context: Pew Research Center estimates that 8 % of all working , residential cellphones in the U.S. are erroneously flagged inactive , which is several points higher than a previous study reported.3 Taken together with the fact that 91 % of U.S. adults own a cellphone , the result is a 7 - percentage - point reduction in sample coverage of U.S. adults . For a national cellphone sample , this reduces the estimated net coverage rate of U.S. adults from about 91 % to 83 % . These net rates are based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s January to June 2015 National Health Interview Survey that 3 % of adults have no telephone and another 6 % have a landline but no cellphone . For national RDD surveys of adults , the inclusion of a landline sample substantially mitigates the reduction in coverage from excluding flagged - inactive numbers ( from 97 % coverage to 93 % , rather than 83 % ) . While excluding flagged - inactive cellphones reduces the survey coverage rate and disproportionately excludes hard - to - reach demographic groups , it does not appear to have a meaningful effect on bias , at least for public opinion surveys . Adults with cellphones erroneously flagged as inactive do differ systematically on several dimensions from those with flagged - active cellphones , as described above , but they constitute too small a fraction of the population to meaningfully move estimates . In the survey , 2 % of all cellphone sample interviews and 1 % of the combined ( cellphone plus landline ) sample interviews were with adults reached on numbers erroneously flagged as inactive using the activity flag . <s> Excluding flagged-inactive cellphone numbers reduces  <s> sample coverage of U.S. adults by seven points  <s> % of U.S. adults with  <s> Only a land line  <s> flagged -inactive cellp hone  <s> a cellphone flagged-active or unknown  <s> 3  <s> 83  <s> No phone  <s> Note: 0. .1% of adultsin NHIS with landline butunknown wireless status included as landline  <s> only Figuresdo notadd to 100% beca use ofrounding  <s> Source Figuresdo Survey conducted Jan 23-March 16, 2014, and CDC's Nationa Health Interview  <s> Survey, ""Cellphone January-June Activity Flags 2015  <s> Survey, ""Cellphone January-June Activity Flags  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","Pew Research Center estimates that 8 % of all working , residential cellphones in the U.S. are erroneously flagged inactive , which is several points higher than a previous study reported.3 Taken together with the fact that 91 % of U.S. adults own a cellphone , the result is a 7 - percentage - point reduction in sample coverage of U.S. adults .

For our purposes , “ opt - out moms ” are mothers who have at least a Master ’s degree , an annual family income of $ 75,000 or more ; a working husband ; and who state that they are out of the workforce in order to care for their family . In families with these highly educated , affluent non - working moms , it may be the husbands who are bringing home the bacon , but in 37 % of the cases , it is the stay - at - home wives who actually have a higher level of education . In 45 % of these families , the spouses have equal educational attainment , and in about 18 % of the cases , the husbands have more education than their wives .

For example , when asked how serious a problem climate change is , women in the U.S. are significantly more likely than American men ( by a margin of 17 percentage points ) to say it ’s a somewhat or very serious problem . Canadian and Australian women ’s concern also outweighs that of men in their respective countries , by 13 points and 12 points , respectively . The gender disparity also occurs in views of personal harm caused by climate change . American women again differ the most from their male counterparts – 69 % of women are concerned it will harm them personally , while fewer than half of men ( 48 % ) express this view . Women are more concerned than men in many of the other countries surveyed , including double - digit gender imbalances in Germany ( +15 points ) and Canada ( +14 ) .

Context: America ’s love affair with the car is well - documented , but many U.S. adults also rely on a bus , train or subway to get around . One - in - ten Americans ( 11 % ) say they take public transportation on a daily or weekly basis , according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted in late 2015 , but who is taking public transit varies substantially by region , nativity , and race and ethnicity . The Northeast , home to several of the most traveled transit systems in the country , has the largest share of adults by region ( 25 % ) who use public transportation on a regular basis ( daily or weekly ) . City dwellers are also more frequent users of mass transit . Some 21 % of urban residents use public transit on a regular basis , compared with 6 % of suburban residents and just 3 % of rural residents . Americans who are lower - income , black or Hispanic , immigrants or under 50 are especially likely to use public transportation on a regular basis , Pew Research Center data show . While there are few racial and ethnic differences in public transit use among non - urban residents , there are substantial differences when looking at only those living in urban areas . Among urban residents , 34 % of blacks and 27 % of Hispanics report taking public transit daily or weekly , compared with only 14 % of whites .

Context: More fathers than mothers in families with two full - time working parents say they and their partner share responsibilities about equally when it comes to managing the children ’s schedules and activities , caring for sick kids and handling household chores , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Mothers in these families see it differently : Many say they are doing more when it comes to these tasks . For example , in families with two full - time working parents overall , 59 % of parents overall say they and their partners share household chores about equally , while 31 % say the mother does more and 9 % say the father does . Moms , however , are twice as likely as dads to say they handle more of these tasks . For their part , most dads see a more even division of household chores : 64 % say they and their partner share this about equally . While it ’s hard to say whose account is the most accurate when it comes to how parenting and household responsibilities are shared , an analysis of the American Time Use Survey ( ATUS ) data provides a glimpse into how full - time working moms and dads spend their time . This analysis shows that while full - time working moms spend more time than full - time working dads on parenting and household tasks , the difference is modest .

Context: About half of U.S. adults ( 51 % ) say transgender individuals should be allowed to use public restrooms that correspond with the gender they currently identify with , according to a new Pew Research Center survey . But nearly as many ( 46 % ) take the opposite position – on the side of the North Carolina law – and say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms that match the gender they were born into . Religion , age , gender and politics are all connected with views on this issue . For instance , a majority of Americans who say they attend religious services at least weekly – especially white evangelicals – say transgender people should be required to use bathrooms of their gender at birth , while most of those who attend services less often ( particularly people who do not identify with any religion ) take the more liberal position that such individuals should be allowed to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity . Also , more women than men take the liberal stance ( 55 % vs. 45 % ) as do young adults when compared with older Americans ( 67 % of those ages 18 to 29 , compared with about half or fewer in older age groups ) . In addition , those who are Democrats or who lean Democratic are far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners ( 68 % vs. 30 % ) to say transgender people should be able to use the bathroom that fits their gender identity . In addition , people who say they personally know someone who is transgender are more likely than those who do not to say transgender people should be allowed to use public bathrooms that match their current gender identity ( 60 % vs. 47 % ) .

Context: The two biggest groups of the unemployed are people who ’ve lost their jobs permanently ( as opposed to those who are temporarily laid off or furloughed but expect to be recalled ) , and people who ’ve resumed their job search and thus are once again considered part of the labor force . Last month , according to BLS , 2.8 million Americans who re - entered the labor force but had n’t yet found jobs were counted as unemployed . Those “ re - entrants , ” as the BLS calls them , made up 31.6 % of the total unemployed population – the highest level since before the Great Recession . That ’s a sign the strengthening economy is making people who ’ve been on the economic sidelines confident enough about their job prospects to start looking again . January was the seventh straight month in which re - entrants outnumbered people who ’d been fired , permanently laid off or otherwise lost their jobs permanently .

Context: More Americans get news on Twitter and Facebook than in the past , according to a new report by Pew Research Center in association with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation . The survey of 2,035 U.S. adults sheds light on Americans ’ evolving news and information habits on the two platforms . More users are getting news on both sites than in the past . Nearly two - thirds ( 63 % ) of Facebook users and the same share of Twitter users get news via each of the social media sites . This is up substantially from 2013 , when about half of each social network ’s users ( 47 % for Facebook , 52 % for Twitter ) reported getting news there . ( In both studies , we defined news as “ information about events and issues beyond just friends and family . ” ) This increase in exposure to news among users emerges even as overall usage of each site has remained steady since 2013 : 17 % of U.S. adults use Twitter and two - thirds ( 66 % ) use Facebook . Overall , 10 % of all U.S. adults get news on Twitter , and 41 % get news on Facebook . The percentage of Twitter users who follow breaking news there is nearly twice as high as that of Facebook users . While the share of users who get news on each site is about the same , Twitter news users are more likely than Facebook news users to depend on the social network for breaking news .

1394,"Question: Describe some differences between urban and rural people? Context: The share of Americans who use ride - hailing services has increased dramatically . Today , 36 % of U.S. adults say they have ever used a ride - hailing service such as Uber or Lyft , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in fall 2018 . By comparison , just 15 % of Americans said they had used these services in late 2015 , and one - third had never heard of ride - hailing before . Ride - hailing use has increased across most demographic groups , but adoption figures continue to vary by age , educational attainment and income level . For example , roughly half of Americans ages 18 to 29 ( 51 % ) say they have used a ride - hailing service , compared with 24 % of those ages 50 and older . Those whose annual household income is $ 75,000 or more are roughly twice as likely as those earning less than $ 30,000 to have used these services ( 53 % vs. 24 % ) . And over half of adults with a bachelor ’s or advanced degree ( 55 % ) say they have used these services , compared with 20 % of those who have a high school diploma or less .

Context: We looked at two measures of consumer confidence : the University of Michigan ’s Index of Consumer Expectations ( part of its broader monthly surveys of consumer sentiment ) and the European Consumer Confidence Indicator , produced by Eurostat , the EU ’s statistical research office . While the two metrics are broadly similar , they ’re calculated differently and reported on different scales . The UMich index is derived from three questions on personal financial expectations a year from now and expectations for the U.S. economy one and five years out , relative to a 1966 base year . The EU metric is the average of the answers to four questions covering expectations for household finances , general economic conditions , unemployment and personal savings over the next 12 months . Despite some ups and downs , the U.S. expectations index generally has been trending modestly upward since the beginning of 2012 ; October ’s preliminary reading of 78.4 , in fact , was the second - highest since the official end of the Great Recession . ( Not that Americans are ready to throw the economy a parade : In August , a Pew Research Center survey found that 54 % of the public expected national economic conditions to be about the same a year from now , while 22 % expected conditions to be better and the same percentage expected them to be worse . ) <s> How Americans, Europeans See the  <s> Economic Future  <s> 78.4  <s> 80  <s> 70  <s> 66.6  <s> U.S Index of Consumer  <s> 60  <s> Expectations  <s> 50  <s> Jan.

2783,"Question: What are opinions about college-educated women marriages? Context: About half of first marriages in the U.S. are likely to survive at least 20 years , according to government estimates . But for one demographic group , marriages last longer than most : College - educated women have an almost eight - in - ten chance of still being married after two decades . Researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics estimate that 78 % of college - educated women who married for the first time between 2006 and 2010 could expect their marriages to last at least 20 years . But among women who have a high school education or less , the share is only 40 % . The probability of a lasting first marriage is derived from marital history data from the National Survey of Family Growth , a nationally representative sample of women and men who were ages 15 to 44 between 2006 and 2010 . Estimates are based on an approach similar to that used to determine life expectancy and assume that marriage patterns in the future will follow patterns today . The findings refer only to opposite - sex marriages ; the sample size was too small to analyze same - sex marriages . <s> College-educated women are more  <s> likely to have long-lasting marriages  <s> Probability that afirst marriage willsurvive at least20  <s> years among women  <s> All women  <s> 52  <s> Bachelor's degree  <s> 78  <s> Some college  <s> 49  <s> High school or less  <s> 40  <s> Note: Probabilitiesare (NSFG) derived from 2006- 2010 National Surveyof  <s> Family been Probabilitiesare Growth (NSFG) (for derived data the among from women 2006- 2010 ages National lysis 22to 44 Surveyof who have  <s> ever been married (for the allwomen among bar, ages ana lysis is among those  <s> ages 15 to 44) ""Bachelor's degree"" does notinclude women with  <s> advanced degrees because ofthe limited availability of data  <s> Source: National Centerfor Hea 1th Statistics, NSFG  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","College - educated women have an almost eight - in - ten chance of still being married after two decades . 78 % of college - educated women who married for the first time could expect their marriages to last at least 20 years .

362,"Question: What is the impact of COVID-19 on remittances sent by migrants to their countries of origin? Context: With many nations under stay - at - home orders and work restrictions due to the COVID-19 crisis , remittances – money sent by migrants to their home countries – are projected to fall by a record 20 % this year . This decline , from a high of $ 714 billion in 2019 to an estimated $ 572 billion in 2020 , comes as the world ’s largest remittance - sending nations have experienced especially stringent lockdowns , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the World Bank , Oxford University and Google . The decline in remittances is projected to hit all regions of the world , as many of the 272 million international migrants lose their jobs and stop sending money home . Remittances to European and Central Asian countries the World Bank defines as low and middle income are projected to decline by 28 % , while slightly smaller declines are expected for low- and middle - income nations in sub - Saharan Africa ( 23 % ) , South Asia ( 22 % ) , Latin America and the Caribbean ( 19 % ) , and the Middle East and North Africa ( 20 % ) , according to the World Bank . These projections are based on information about prevailing wages and the number of international migrants in each country . It is not unusual for worldwide remittances from migrants to ebb and flow with economic circumstances in sending countries . In 2009 , during the Great Recession , global remittances declined 5 % as economies shrank . And in 2016 , remittances fell 1 % , driven by weak growth in many countries and declining oil prices . Remittances can also increase during hard times in migrants ’ home countries . For example , remittances to Yemen more than doubled between 2011 and 2019 amid a civil war in that country . <s> Global remittances in 2020 projected  <s> to decline more than during the Great  <s> Recession in every region of the world  <s> % decline in remittance inflows to low- and middle-  <s> income countries by world region in 2009 and 2020  <s> (projected)  <s> 2009  <s> 5  <s> East Asia and Pacific  <s> 2020 (proj.)  <s> 13  <s> 11  <s> Latin America and Caribbean  <s> 19  <s> 6  <s> Middle East and North Africa  <s> 20  <s> +5  <s> South Asia  <s> 22  <s> Sub-Saharan Africa  <s> 23  <s> 15  <s> Europe and Central Asia  <s> 28  <s> Source: World Bank  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","Remittances to European and Central Asian countries the World Bank defines as low and middle income are projected to decline by 28 % , while slightly smaller declines are expected for low- and middle - income nations in sub - Saharan Africa ( 23 % ) , South Asia ( 22 % ) , Latin America and the Caribbean ( 19 % ) , and the Middle East and North Africa ( 20 % ) , according to the World Bank"

5772,"Question: What do different races say about posts on social media? Context: In recent years , these platforms have provided new arenas for national conversations about race and racial inequality . Some researchers and activists credit social media – in particular , Black Twitter – with propelling racially focused issues to greater national attention . In fact , two of the most used hashtags around social causes in Twitter history focus on race and criminal justice : hashtag_Ferguson and hashtag_BlackLivesMatter . In addition to social and political issues , social media also serve as places where conversations about race intersect with a number of issues , including pop culture , sports and everyday personal experiences . A new Pew Research Center survey finds significant differences in the way black and white adults use social media to share and interact with race - related content1 And a Pew Research Center analysis of tweets reveals that key news events – from Baltimore , to Charleston , South Carolina , to Dallas – often serve as a catalyst for social media conversations about race . Black social media users ( 68 % ) are roughly twice as likely as whites ( 35 % ) to say that at least some of the posts they see on social networking sites are about race or race relations . When it comes to their own postings , a similar racial gap exists . Among black social media users , 28 % say most or some of what they post is about race or race relations ; 8 % of whites say the same .

In addition to asking about general usage of social networking sites in our current survey , we included a stand - alone question about Twitter and found that 18 % of online adults are now Twitter users . This is roughly double the 8 % of online adults who used Twitter in November 2010 , the first time we asked about Twitter as a stand - alone platform . <s> Adult use of social networking sites and Twitter-change  <s> over time  <s> %of adult internet users who use social networking sites or Twitter, over time  <s> Social networking sites  <s> Twitter  <s> 80%  <s> 72%  <s> 70%  <s> 60%  <s> 50%  <s> 40%  <s> 30%  <s> 20%  <s> 18%  <s> 10%  <s> 8%  <s> 8%  <s> 0%  <s> 2005  <s> 2006  <s> 2008  <s> 2009  <s> 2010  <s> 2011  <s> 2012  <s> 2013  <s> Source: Tracking Pew Research Center's Internet May & American Life Project tracking surveys 2005-2013  <s> Spring Tracking Survey, April 17 May 19, 2013 N=1 885 adult internet users ages 18+  <s> Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish and on landline and cell phones.

4810,"Question: Comment on trends in unemployment and pessimism about future among countries in EU? Context: Against this backdrop , a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that people in EU nations with higher unemployment rates tend to voice more pessimism about future job prospects in their country . The analysis also finds that youth unemployment rates , as well as changes in a country ’s gross domestic product , are linked to economic attitudes in EU member states . Across 14 EU nations surveyed by the Center this year , a median of 54 % of adults say they are pessimistic about the future availability of well - paying jobs in their country , ranging from just 28 % who say this in Sweden to 76 % in Spain and 80 % in Greece . These attitudes are connected with current economic conditions . The unemployment rate in Greece sat at 19.3 % in 2018 – the highest in the EU , though down from its peak of 27.5 % in 2013 – while Spain had a rate of 15.3 % in 2018 . By comparison , the unemployment rate was much lower in Sweden ( 6.3 % ) than in Greece and Spain , perhaps explaining why Swedes are less pessimistic about the future availability of well - paying jobs in their country . This pattern is not uniformly the case , however . People in France and the UK stand out for being much less optimistic than their counterparts in nations with similar youth unemployment rates . French and British adults , in fact , are about as pessimistic about the financial future of the next generation as people in Italy , Spain and Greece – even though France and the UK have youth unemployment rates that are roughly 10 to 20 percentage points lower . <s> In EU pessimism countries, higher well-paying unemployment is related to  <s> more pessimism about well-paying jobs in the future  <s> % who are generally pessimistic about the future availability of well-paying  <s> jobs in their country  <s> 100%  <s> Greece  <s> Spain  <s> France  <s> Italy  <s> Bulgaria  <s> UK  <s> Hungary  <s> Slovakia  <s> Lithuania  <s> Germany  <s> Poland  <s> Czech Rep.  <s> Netherlands  <s> Sweden  <s> Correlation = +0. 788  <s> 10  <s> 15  <s> 20  <s> 25  <s> 2018 unemployment rate (%)  <s> Source: Spring 2019 Global Attitudes Survey.

Context: The very different assumptions about fertility and migration result in a reasonably large range in population figures for Mexico in 2050 according to the various projections : This chart displays the historical information on Mexicans in the United States , as previously displayed , together with projections of Mexicans in the United States based on the CONAPO assumptions about Mexico - U.S. migration . The number of Mexicans in the United States is projected to increase steadily from 10.6 million in 2004 to more than 22 million in 2050 . At this time , more than 1 - in-7 ( or 15 % ) of persons born in Mexico are projected to be living in the United States . In addition to the migrants in the United States , the Mexicans in the U.S. have children who , were the migrants still living in Mexico , would be Mexican - born . These post-2000 births also represent a sizeable group . By 2050 , these post-2000 births to Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. and their descendants amount to another almost 17 million persons in addition to the 22.2 million shown in the chart . Thus , the 39 million Mexican immigrants and their post-2000 U.S.-born descendants would be equal to about 30 % of the 130 million Mexicans projected to be living in Mexico . <s> Growth of Mexicans in U.S. Continues  <s> Millions of Mexican Migrants in U.S  <s> Percent of Mexico's Population  <s> 15%  <s> 22.2 Million  <s> (2050)  <s> 21.2  <s> 12%  <s> 20  <s> 19. 7  <s> Mexican-Born Population in the U.S. (000s)  <s> Percent of Mexican Population InU.S  <s> 16.2  <s> 15  <s> 9 .0%  <s> 9%  <s> 8.3%  <s> 12.8  <s> 6.7%  <s> 10.6 (2004)  <s> 10  <s> 6%  <s> 9.2  <s> 5.2%  <s> 6.  <s> 3:0%  <s> 3%  <s> 4.5  <s> 1.4%  <s> 1.6%  <s> 2.2  <s> .454  <s> .760  <s> 0%  <s> ig  <s> 8  <s> is  <s> a  <s> ig  <s> is  <s> is  <s> is  <s> B  <s> B  <s> ig  <s> $  <s> S  <s> a  <s> ig  <s> is  <s> E  <s> 8  <s> a it B is  <s> 5  <s> a ","The number of Mexicans in the United States is projected to increase steadily from 10.6 million in 2004 to more than 22 million in 2050 .

5391,"Question: Describe the trend of crimes reported to police? Context: Only about half of the violent crimes and a third of the property crimes that occur in the United States each year are reported to police . And most of the crimes that are reported do n’t result in the arrest , charging and prosecution of a suspect , according to government statistics . In 2015 , the most recent year for which data are available , 47 % of the violent crimes and 35 % of the property crimes tracked by the Bureau of Justice Statistics were reported to police . Those figures come from an annual BJS survey of 90,000 households , which asks Americans ages 12 and older whether they were victims of a crime in the past six months and , if so , whether they reported that crime to law enforcement or not . Even when violent and property crimes are reported to police , they ’re often not solved – at least based on a measure known as the clearance rate . That ’s the share of cases each year that are closed , or “ cleared , ” through the arrest , charging and referral of a suspect for prosecution . In 2015 , 46 % of the violent crimes and 19 % of the property crimes reported to police in the U.S. were cleared , according to FBI data . Reporting and clearance rates for violent and property crimes have held relatively steady over the past two decades , even as overall crime rates in both categories have declined sharply . Between 1995 and 2015 , the share of violent crimes reported to police each year ranged from 40 % to 51 % ; for property crimes , the share ranged from 32 % to 40 % .

7436,"Question: How do most bilingual Latinos communicate in their workplace? Context: Although adult English / Spanish bilingual Latinos have some proficiency in speaking both English and Spanish , they tend to use the languages differently depending on the setting . English is far and away the dominant language of U.S. commerce and trade , and dominates U.S. workplaces . English / Spanish bilingual Latinos report that they largely speak English in the workplace . About 60 % of bilingual Hispanic workers usually speak more English than Spanish at work ( 29 % ) , or use only English at work ( 33 % ) . Widespread Spanish language usage at work is relatively rare among bilingual workers . About one in ten report speaking “ more Spanish than English ” or “ only Spanish ” at work ( see Figure 3 ) . English / Spanish bilingual Hispanics seem to be markedly different from the wider Hispanic adult population in their mass media preferences . The survey asked respondents whether they typically received news ( via TV or radio ) in English or Spanish . Almost 40 % of all Latino adults said either “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English , ” reflecting the usage patterns of Latino adults with little speaking ability in English . Bilingual Latinos extensively use English to obtain news broadcasts , as Figure 3 illustrates . Nearly five in ten bilingual Hispanics hear news in “ English only ” or “ more English than Spanish . ” Less than a fifth reported obtaining news in “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English . ” So the preponderance of bilingual speaking Latinos either obtains news in English , or does not express an exclusive preference for hearing news in Spanish . At home English / Spanish speaking Latinos are about evenly divided in their use of Spanish and English ( see Figure 3 ) .

7175,"Question: How is people's response regarding the swine flu disease? Context: The public continued to follow reports about the condition of the U.S. economy closely last week . Still , about a third ( 34 % ) say they followed reports about the swine flu in the U.S. and elsewhere most closely , slightly more than the 30 % that say they followed economic stories most closely . But with the swine flu outbreak apparently not as dangerous as first feared , the share saying they followed news about the virus very closely was down 9 points from the previous week to 34 % . Meanwhile , the economy received the most coverage , filling 16 % of the newshole as measured by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism . That number separates out coverage of the April unemployment report and the Obama budget , which together bring total economic coverage to 21 % , according to PEJ . The swine flu , which dominated news coverage the week before with 31 % of coverage , dropped to the second spot – taking up 9 % of the newshole – as fears eased about the immediate spread and potential lethality of the H1N1 virus . <s> News Interest May vs. News Coverage  <s> May 4-10  <s> Swine flu  <s> 34  <s> Economy 30  <s> 16  <s> Unemp loyment 3  <s> Pakistan  <s> 5  <s> Gay marriage  <s> Federal budget  <s> Interest: percent who named story as most closely followed  <s> Coverage: percent of news coverage devoted to story ",34 % say they followed reports about the swine flu in the U.S. and elsewhere most closely .

4020,"Question: What are opinions about anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish among the Europeans? Context: A notable parallel between anti - Muslim and anti - Jewish opinion in Western Europe is that both sentiments are most prevalent among the same groups of people . Older people and those with less education are more anti - Semitic and anti - Muslim than are younger people or those with more education . Looking at combined data from France , Germany and Spain – the three Western European countries where unfavorable opinions of Jews are most common – people ages 50 and older express more negative views of both Jews and Muslims than do those younger than 50 . Similarly , Europeans who have not attended college are consistently more likely than those who have to hold unfavorable opinions of both groups . There are some political parallels too . Anti - Muslim and anti - Jewish opinions are most prevalent among Europeans on the political right . For example , among respondents from France , Germany and Spain who place themselves on the political right , 56 % express a negative view of Muslims , compared with 42 % of those on the left and 45 % of those in the center .

Context: First is the “ one - party surge , ” where one of the parties significantly increases its vote from the previous midterm while the other party ’s vote remains essentially unchanged . That is what happened in 1994 , when Republicans won control of both houses of Congress . The nationwide GOP congressional vote spiked by more than 9 million votes from 1990 , the biggest increase in one party ’s vote from one midterm to another since World War II . Meanwhile , the Democratic total declined by 400,000 votes . Another way to produce a big change in Congress is a “ one - party collapse , ” where a huge number of voters from one of the parties simply sit out the election . That is what happened in 1974 , when the dispiriting backdrop of the Watergate scandal led to a nearly 3 - million vote falloff in the Republican House vote from 1970 . The Democratic vote grew by barely 1 million . But the GOP drop off was so severe that it cost the Republicans nearly 50 House seats . A third way to effect considerable change in Congress is what might be called “ unequal gains , ” where both parties add votes from the previous midterm but one party gains far more than the other . That happened in 1982 , President Reagan ’s first midterm , when the Republican congressional vote grew by more than 3 million from 1978 , but the Democratic tally swelled by more than 6 million .

5471,"Question: How's about newspapers circulation declining? Context: This overall decline in circulation coincided with a double - digit decline in advertising revenue for the industry as a whole . A separate Pew Research Center analysis based on the year - end financial statements of seven publicly traded U.S. newspaper companies suggests that advertising revenue across the industry declined even more sharply than in recent years : a 10 % decline , which outpaces the 8 % decline in 2015 . ( More details about this analysis are also available in the newspaper industry fact sheet . ) This decline put total ad revenue for the industry in 2016 at $ 18 billion . This is nearly a third of what it was just 10 years ago : In 2006 , the Newspaper Association of America , now known as the News Media Alliance , put total industry ad revenue at $ 49 billion . By contrast , circulation revenue has been steady over the past few years , rising from $ 10.4 billion in 2012 to $ 10.9 billion in both 2015 and 2016 . This is a small bright spot for the industry , and comes as some publishers are pursuing a “ subscription - first model ” by focusing on growing the number of subscribers rather than retaining advertising revenue . Still , gains in circulation revenue have not been nearly enough to make up for losses in advertising revenue – a pattern that holds true even at the large newspapers and major chains . According to year - end financial statements , The New York Times saw a year - over - year decline of 9 % in advertising revenue but a 3 % rise in circulation revenue , for an overall revenue decline of 2 % .

Context: For example , in the unlikely instance that 100 % of the cell - only adults favored a troop withdrawal from Iraq , and landline respondents remained divided ( with 54 % favoring withdrawal ) , then the combined survey estimate would shift to 59 % – a five - point increase . The standard survey alone would underestimate national support for withdrawal . Alternatively , if just 30 % of the cell - only respondents favored withdrawal , the combined estimate would be 50 % , four points below the current estimate from the landline survey . These effects are potentially greater when analyzing subgroups in the population , such as young people , who are less likely to be reached on a landline . For example , if 100 % of cell - only young people ( ages 18 - 29 ) favored a troop withdrawal , the combined sample estimate for this age group would be 72 % in favor of withdrawal , rather than the 60 % that the landline sample of young people produces . <s> Hypothetical Combine d Samp le Estimates  <s> For Different Levels of Support for Troop  <s> Withdrawal among the Cell-Only  <s> 72%  <s> > it I F L  <s> 18-29 yrr  <s> I I S  <s> Actual  <s> 58%  <s> 53x  <s> 59%  <s> Overall  <s> 54 %  <s> 50%  <s> Actual  <s> 30%  <s> 40%  <s> 50%  <s> 60x  <s> 70%  <s> 80%  <s> 90% 100%  <s> % Favoring Iraq Withd rawal  <s> among Cell Only Respondents ","For example , in the unlikely instance that 100 % of the cell - only adults favored a troop withdrawal from Iraq , and landline respondents remained divided ( with 54 % favoring withdrawal ) , then the combined survey estimate would shift to 59 % – a five - point increase ."

5693,"Question: Describe some details about hen sample sizes are smaller, margins of error are wider In a hypothetical poll of 1,000 U.S. adults representative of the US population? Context: A typical survey of the U.S. population consists of 1,000 adult respondents . This threshold reflects the way in which many researchers attempt to balance survey cost with survey quality : A national sample of 1,000 interviews yields reasonably good precision for major subgroups defined by gender , age , race and ethnicity ; much larger sample sizes will reduce the margin of error minimally but also make polls much more expensive . ( Pew Research Center samples are typically 1,500 respondents or more . ) A common rule of thumb used at Pew Research Center and elsewhere is to only report subgroup estimates if they are based on at least 100 respondents . In a perfectly representative survey with 1,000 adults , we would expect about 152 Hispanics , 117 blacks and just 54 Asians – with the latter subgroup falling well under the 100 - respondent limit . The size of this Asian subgroup would simply be too small to make reliable estimates of the views and experiences of Asian American adults as a whole . For example , if we were to find that “ 50 % of U.S. Asians approve of … , ” the margin of error for the Asian subgroup of 54 respondents would be 13.3 percentage points – meaning that somewhere between 37 % and 63 % of Asians in the country would “ approve of ” the hypothetical topic .

Context: March 3 is “ Super Tuesday ” on this year ’s Democratic presidential nominating calendar – the biggest single day in both number of elections and the total number of delegates at stake . All told , 1,357 delegates , or about 34 % of all pledged delegates to this summer ’s Democratic National Convention , will be chosen in 14 state primaries and one territorial caucus ( American Samoa ) . And a weeklong “ global primary ” for overseas Democratic voters also starts March 3 , with 13 delegates at stake . While clearly significant , this year ’s Super Tuesday is by no means the “ super - est ” – or the earliest – one the Democratic Party has ever had . By both contests held and delegates awarded , the party ’s biggest Super Tuesday was Feb. 5 , 2008 – 1,688 delegates , more than 47 % of the pledged total , were chosen in 24 primaries and caucuses , a haul so impressive that it was dubbed “ Super - Duper Tuesday ” and “ Tsunami Tuesday . ” ( This post focuses on the Democrats because Republicans are n’t having a competitive nomination contest this year . ) <s> Some Democratic Super Tuesdays are  <s> more 'super' than others  <s> % of pledged  <s> # of caucuses  <s> Date  <s> and primaries  <s> delegates  <s> March 3, 2020  <s> 34%  <s> 16  <s> March 1, 2016  <s> 22  <s> 13  <s> Feb. 5, 2008  <s> 47  <s> 24  <s> 33  <s> 10  <s> March 2, 2004  <s> 16  <s> 37  <s> March 7, 2000  <s> 22  <s> March 10, 1992  <s> 11  <s> 37  <s> 21  <s> March 8, 1988  <s> Note: 1996 and 2012 not shown because the Democratic  <s> nomination was not contested those years.  <s> Source: Pew Research Center research.  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","the party ’s biggest Super Tuesday was Feb. 5 , 2008 – 1,688 delegates , more than 47 % of the pledged total"

6302,"Question: Comment on the Venezuelan views of Cuba by ideology. Context: Venezuela ’s socialist leader Nicolás Maduro is no fan of the U.S. , but that does n’t mean Venezuelans take the same view . According to Pew Research Center ’s Spring 2014 global survey , Venezuelans have generally positive attitudes concerning the U.S. At a rate of two - to - one , the Venezuelan public holds a more favorable ( 62 % ) than unfavorable ( 31 % ) view of their biggest trade partner . This represents a nine point uptick in support since 2013 , when 53 % shared positive feelings toward the U.S. Younger Venezuelans are especially likely to view the U.S. favorably – 66 % of those ages 18 - 29 express a positive opinion . Still , a majority of those ages 50 and older ( 56 % ) also perceive the U.S. favorably . The biggest disagreements about the U.S. break along ideological lines . Venezuelans who lean to the right of the political spectrum see the U.S. in an overwhelmingly positive light ( 84 % ) , while only 12 % have a negative opinion . Venezuela ’s political left , which aligns with President Maduro ’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela , tends to be more critical of the U.S. ( 62 % unfavorable v. 34 % favorable ) . This is none too surprising given the tumultuous relationship between Maduro and the U.S. in recent months and the many years of tension between Washington and Maduro ’s predecessor , Hugo Chávez . Chávez , who blamed the U.S. for organizing a coup against him in 2002 , often stoked anti - American sentiment with colorful quips , including claims that the U.S. “ invented technology to spread cancer ” to South American leaders and referring to then - President George W. Bush as “ the devil , ” “ a donkey ” and “ a drunkard . ” Despite this , a majority of moderates ( 63 % ) see America favorably . Meanwhile , most Venezuelans have a negative opinion of Venezuela ’s political and economic ally , Cuba . The two countries have a very interdependent relationship , with Venezuela sending Cuba subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban doctors , teachers and military advisors . Yet 57 % of Venezuelans give Cuba an unfavorable rating , with fully 38 % saying they have a very unfavorable impression of their trade partner . Only 37 % have a favorable outlook . The most notable difference of opinion hinges on political ideology . While roughly seven - in - ten ( 72 % ) left - leaning Venezuelans view Cuba favorably , only 14 % on the right share this attitude . Moderates also tend to be more disapproving of Cuba ( 34 % favorable v. 54 % unfavorable ) . Protestors in Caracas earlier this year , lauded by opposition groups in both Venezuela and Cuba , attributed such feelings to the perceived “ Cubanization ” of Venezuela , claiming that the Cuban government increasingly plays a role in Venezuelan efforts to suppress dissidents and wants to force Cuba ’s strict socialist ideas onto Venezuelans . <s> Ideology U.S., a Factor in Venezuelan Views  <s> Ideology of U.S., Cuba  <s> Favorable views of by ideology  <s> U.S.  <s> TOTAL  <s> 62%  <s> Left  <s> 34  <s> Moderate  <s> 63  <s> Right  <s> 84  <s> Cuba  <s> TOTAL  <s> Left  <s> Moderate  <s> 34  <s> Right  <s> 14  <s> Source: Global Attitudes Spring 2014 survey.

In a survey conducted in the region in 2014 , 9 % of respondents across 19 Latin American countries said they were raised as Protestants , while 19 % identified Protestant ( or evangelical ) Christianity as their current religion .

And they are more likely to take conservative positions on issues such as divorce , abortion , gay marriage and gender norms . One relatively recent and distinctive Protestant movement that has gained ground globally is Pentecostalism . While practices vary , Pentecostal churches often emphasize the “ gifts of the Holy Spirit , ” such as divine healing , speaking in tongues and receiving direct revelations from God . These practices are common among Protestants in sub - Saharan Africa , Latin America and even in Asia .

Nationwide , single young men outnumber their female counterparts . The overall male - to - female ratio is 115:100 among single adults ages 25 to 34 . But when we limit the young men to those who are currently employed , the ratio falls to 84 employed single men for every 100 single women . ( We count both young adults who have never been married and those who have been previously married as single or unmarried . ) So , which large metro areas have the best “ marriage market ” ? For women seeking a male partner with a job , our analysis found that San Jose , Calif. , tops the list among large metro areas , with 114 single employed men for every 100 single women . Among all single young adults , there were 141 men for every 100 women in this area .

5956,"Question: What is the opinion of right-wing populist parties about stronger economic relationship with Russia over an adversarial geopolitical one ? Context: Within these countries , those who hold favorable views of right - wing populist parties – like the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) or Italy ’s Northern League – are more likely to express confidence in Putin than those who hold unfavorable views of those parties .

Context: Early signs are that 2017 could see an increase in the rate of naturalization of lawful permanent residents . According to the latest figures released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ’s Citizenship and Immigration Services , there were 525,000 naturalization applications submitted during the first half of fiscal year 2017 , which started Oct. 1.3 That number is up 21 % from the 435,000 applications submitted in the same period of 2016 , which already had seen a spike on naturalization applications compared with previous years . The total applications for fiscal 2016 were up by 24 % compared with 2015 , and represented the highest number of applications for naturalization since 2008 . Meanwhile , the number of lawful permanent residents admitted since 2010 , many of whom would have recently become eligible to apply for citizenship , has stabilized at around 1 million per year since 2010 . Even so , the volume of citizenship applications in 2017 and 2016 still pales in comparison to the record levels seen in 1997 ( 1.41 million applications ) and 2007 ( 1.38 million).These spikes were triggered in large part by congressional legislation passed a decade earlier that provided a path to lawful permanent residence and eventual citizenship for many unauthorized immigrants.4 The spike in 2007 occurred ahead of an increase in the citizenship application fee for adults , which rose from $ 330 to $ 595 on July 30 , 2007 . <s> Trends in obtainment of lawful permanent residence  <s> and naturalization applications  <s> In thousands, perfiscal year  <s> 2,000  <s> People LPR obtaining  <s> 1.800  <s> LPR obtaining status  <s> 1 600  <s> 1,383  <s> 1,413  <s> 1,400  <s> 1,200  <s> 1,000  <s> 972  <s> 800  <s> 600  <s> Naturaliza tion  <s> 400  <s> appllica tions  <s> 200  <s> 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2016  <s> Note: For lawful permanentresidents data are onlyavailable through fiscalyear2015.  <s> Lawful perma nentresidentadmicsions include onlyavailable both new immigrantarrivals and people  <s> adjusting their status.

On May 26 - 27 , presidential elections will be held in Egypt , whose fairness has already been questioned and which will almost certainly result in victory for Abdel Fattah El - Sisi , the former general who led the military takeover .

A slim majority ( 54 % ) of Egyptians have a positive opinion of Sisi , and the same percentage say they favor last July ’s military takeover that dislodged President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood from power .

7140,"Question: How are the statistics of people following Rod Blagojevich's news relative to others? Context: The governor ’s arrest , based on information gathered from a federal wiretap investigation , led all news coverage last week , accounting for 28 % of the newshole , according to the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism . The scandal was the top story in three sectors ( online , radio and cable TV ) , making up 44 % of all cable news coverage . The Blagojevich case surpassed the level of weekly news coverage devoted to Spitzer ( 23 % ) when that story broke earlier this year .

While the Blagojevich scandal dominated news coverage , many Americans remained focused on the nation ’s economic crisis and news about a potential multi - billion government bailout for the U.S. auto industry . A majority ( 51 % ) followed economic news very closely . About one - in - four ( 24 % ) named economic news as the story they followed most closely . Four - in - ten ( 40 % ) say they followed news about the auto industry bailout very closely , while 24 % list this as their top story . By comparison , 29 % followed the Blagojevich scandal very closely and just 14 % say it was the story they followed most closely . Following the extensive Blagojevich coverage , press accounts favored news about government assistance to the automakers ( 18 % of all news ) over reports about the economy ( 11 % ) . In other news , slightly more than two - in - ten ( 22 % ) paid very close attention to the discovery of remains in Florida that could be those of missing toddler Caylee Anthony .

Context: Hillary Clinton is now officially the first woman to top the ticket of a major U.S. political party . Her candidacy and controversial comments about women made by Donald Trump have raised the question of whether a long - standing gender gap in American politics could grow wider in 2016 . In the 1972 and 1976 elections , there was no difference in candidate support between men and women . Over the last nine presidential elections , however , women have consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates at higher rates than men . Most recently , in 2012 , there was a 10 - percentage - point gender gap : 55 % of women voted for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney , compared with 45 % of men . The gap in 2012 was little different than it had been in Ronald Reagan ’s victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980 , when 45 % of women and just 36 % of men voted for Carter .

Of these , 17 voted to re - elect President Obama but sent a GOP representative to Capitol Hill ; nine opted for Mitt Romney and also a Democratic representative . ( On an individual voter level , a Pew Research Center analysis in 2014 estimated that about eight - in - ten likely voters in areas with multiple major contests would vote a straight - party ticket that fall . Split - ticket voting also has declined at the state level . ) First , split - ticket districts were overwhelmingly Republican for the presidency but Democratic when it came to the House ( a combined 92.6 % of all split - ticket districts in the five election cycles between 1972 and 1988 ) . And second , tickets in Southern districts were far more likely to be split than those in any other region : Of all districts that split their presidential and House votes between 1972 and 1988 , 41.2 % were from Southern states even though the South accounted for just 31.5 % of all House seats .

Context: In the wake of Europe ’s recession and currency crisis , support for the European Union and the belief that European economic integration was good for one ’s country had declined precipitously across Europe , reaching a low point in 2013 . But this year , European public opinion is looking more upbeat .

5130,"Question: Compare partisans opinions about increasing spending for environmental protection. Context: Democrats continue to be much more likely to say spending should be increased than Republicans – about seven - in - ten Democrats ( 73 % ) say this , compared with just 27 % of Republicans . The numbers saying this in both parties are largely unchanged since 2017 , though both parties are more likely to say this than they were six years ago . More than half of the public ( 55 % ) say they would increase spending on environmental protection if they were making up the budget for the federal government this year . This is larger than the 46 % who said this in 2017 and much larger than the one - third of Americans who said they would increase spending in 2013 . The share of Democrats saying they would increase spending on environmental protection has risen steadily since 2011 .

6823,"Question: Describe Americans views about the possibility of transplanting a lab-grown organ in the future. Context: A substantial majority of Americans ( 81 % ) believe that within the next 50 years people needing an organ transplant will have new organs custom made for them in a lab . Belief that this development will occur is especially high among men ( 86 % of whom believe this will happen ) , those under age 50 ( 86 % ) , those who have attended college ( 85 % ) , and those with relatively high household incomes . But although expectations for this development are especially high within these groups , three - quarters or more of every major demographic group feels that custom organs are likely to become a reality in the next half - century . The public is more evenly split on whether computers will soon match humans when it comes to creating music , novels , paintings , or other important works of art : 51 % think that this will happen in the next 50 years , while 45 % think that it will not . In contrast to their expectations for custom - built organs , college graduates and those with high incomes are comparatively unlikely to expect that computers will advance to this level of development . Some 59 % of college graduates and 57 % of Americans earning $ 75,000 or more per year feel that computers will not be able to produce works of art that are on par with those produced by humans within the next 50 years . Compared with custom organs and computer produced art , the public has less confidence that the two common science fiction tropes of teleportation and colonization of other planets will come to pass . Two in five Americans ( 39 % ) think that teleportation will be possible within the next 50 years , while slightly fewer—33%—expect to live in a world in which humans have long - term colonies on other planets . Young adults are especially likely to view space colonization as a long - term eventuality : 43 % of 18 - 29 year olds see this happening in the next half - century , compared with about a quarter of those over age 50 . On the other hand , high - income Americans are pessimistic about the prospects of space colonization : just 20 % of those with an annual household income of $ 75,000 or more think this is a realistic prediction . From a list of futuristic inventions that includes space colonies and teleportation , Americans actually have the least confidence in the prediction that humans of the future will be able to control the weather : just 19 % of the public thinks that this will probably happen . Older adults are especially pessimistic about this development , as just 11 % of Americans ages 65 and older think that controlling the weather is likely to happen over the next 50 years . But even among the most “ optimistic ” demographic groups , the expectation that humans will control the weather in the next half - century is a decidedly minority viewpoint . <s> 50-year predictions  <s> % of USS adults who feel that the following will/won't  <s> happen in the next 50 years  <s> Won't happen Will happen  <s> Lab-grown custom  <s> 15  <s> 81  <s> organs for transplant  <s> Computers create art  <s> 45  <s> 51  <s> as well was humans do  <s> Scientists will have  <s> 56  <s> 39  <s> solved teleportation  <s> Humans will have long  <s> 64  <s> 33  <s> term space colonies  <s> Humans will control  <s> 77  <s> 19  <s> the weather  <s> Pew Research Center February13-18 2014 survey, n=1 001  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ",A substantial majority of Americans ( 81 % ) believe that within the next 50 years people needing an organ transplant will have new organs custom made for them in a lab .

Context: With a contested primary in only one party this year , fewer Americans are closely following news about the presidential campaign than four years ago .

Context: A new study from Pew Research Center suggests that , after decades of consistent decline , U.S. telephone survey response rates have plateaued over the past four years .

Context: Over half ( 54 % ) of the Americans who are most likely to sign up for health coverage through the   new health care exchanges — the uninsured and those who buy their own coverage — would opt for a plan that costs less even if the coverage is narrower , according to a new Kaiser Health Tracking poll released today . Broader plans at a higher cost would be the choice of 34 % . The public , taken as a whole , leans the other way , with 51 % saying they prefer a plan that costs more money but provides a broader network of providers while 37 % would choose a lower - cost option with less choice . Americans who have employer - provided coverage prefer higher - cost / broader network plans by an even larger margin : 55 % to 34 % .   But Kaiser found some wiggle room in the opinions of those in the higher or lower cost camps . When the 37 % of the overall public who said they preferred the lower cost plans were asked if they would still feel the same if they found out they would not be able to visit the doctors or hospitals they usually use , the percentage saying they would stick with that option fell to 23 % . On the flip side of the question , when the Americans who said they preferred the more expensive , broader plans were told they could save about 25 % on health care costs by going for narrower plans , the share of those choosing the more costly option dropped from 51 % to 37 % . <s> Preferences For Narrow Versus Broad Network Plans  <s> Which type of health insurance plan would you rather have? a plan that..,  <s> Costs less money but has a more limited range of  <s> Costs more money but allows you to see  <s> doctors and hospitals that you are allowed to see  <s> broader range of doctors and hospitals  <s> Total Public  <s> 37%  <s> 51%  <s> Employer -Sponsored insurance (age 18- 64)  <s> 34%  <s> 55%  <s> 54%  <s> Uninsured or purchase own insurance (age 18-64)  <s> 35%  <s> AISER  <s> NOTE: Neitheraf thesc/scomething.kik NOL) and Don't Know/Reiused responses.nct shown  <s> SOURCE: Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Pall icanducted February 11-17 2014) ",Americans who have employer - provided coverage prefer higher - cost / broader network plans by an even larger margin : 55 % to 34 % .

2158,"Question: Compare the rate of people who believe in hell in countries of the Central and Eastern Europe? Context: A similar pattern emerges when it comes to a variety of religious concepts , such as miracles , the existence of the soul , or fate . For most religious beliefs mentioned in the survey , the Czech Republic has among the lowest levels of belief in the region , and typically falls far below the regional median . For example , 19 % of Czechs believe in hell , compared with a regional median of 54 % – which includes roughly six - in - ten adults in Poland ( 62 % ) and Croatia ( 60 % ) . But that does not mean that the country is entirely devoid of religious or supernatural beliefs . Despite relatively low levels of belief in each concept , a majority of the Czech public ( 65 % ) believes in at least one of the nine concepts included in the survey ( belief in God plus the eight items in the accompanying chart ) . Even among religiously unaffiliated Czechs , 52 % believe in at least one of the concepts , including about a third ( 32 % ) who believe in fate ( i.e. , that the course of one ’s life is largely or wholly preordained ) .

6336,"Question: Compare the high school complete rate of different ethnic groups. Context: The decline in the national dropout rate has been driven , in part , by substantially fewer Hispanic and black youth dropping out of school ( the non - Hispanic white dropout rate has not fallen as sharply ) . Although Hispanics still have the highest dropout rate among all major racial and ethnic groups , it reached a record - low of 14 % in 2013 , compared with 32 % of Hispanic 18- to 24 - year - olds who were dropouts in 2000 . The decline in the size of the Hispanic dropout population has been particularly noteworthy because it ’s happened at the same time that the Hispanic youth population is growing . The number of Hispanic 18- to 24 - year - old dropouts peaked at 1.5 million in 2001 and fell to 889,000 by 2013 , even though the size of the Hispanic youth population has grown by more than 50 % since 2000 .

4192,"Question: What is trend in unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. since 1990? Context: In my written statement , I will cover a range of research findings about unauthorized immigrants : I start with national and state trends in the size and growth of the unauthorized immigrant population . These trends are analyzed with regard to the national origins of the unauthorized immigrants , focusing on those from Mexico . Then I turn to a discussion of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. labor force and changing patterns over time . Finally , I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants are represented with a discussion of differences across the states . This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last November ( Passel and Cohn , 2014 ) and a new report we are releasing today ( Passel and Cohn , 2015 ) . The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990 . After 2007 , the trend changed abruptly and the numbers dropped dramatically by about 1 million over the next two years to 11.3 million in 2009 as the number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving plummeted and large numbers left the country . Since 2009 , the national unauthorized immigrant population has remained essentially unchanged as arrivals and departures have come into rough balance . ( See Figure 1 . ) From 1990 to 2007 , the number of unauthorized immigrants increased in every state , but growth was slower in the six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations than in the rest of the nation as a whole . California , the state with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in all years , experienced the largest numerical growth , but its 88 % increase from 1990 to 2007 was slower than that of other large states and nearly all smaller states . As a group , the other five largest states ( Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , New York and Texas ) experienced growth in their unauthorized immigrant population at the national average of 250 % over the period . Meanwhile , the unauthorized immigrant population in the rest of the country increased almost sevenfold , from 700,000 in 1990 to 4.7 million in 2007 . <s> FIGURE1  <s> Growth in Unauthorized Immigration Has Leveled Off  <s> In millions  <s> 14.0  <s> 12.2  <s> 11.5  <s> 11.2  <s> 11.1  <s> 12.0  <s> 113  <s> 10.0  <s> 6  <s> 8.0  <s> 6.0  <s> 3.5  <s> 4.0  <s> 2.0  <s> 0.0  <s> 1990  <s> 1995  <s> 2000  <s> 2005  <s> 2010 2012  <s> Note Shading surrounding line indicates low and high 2000, points 2005 ofthe 2007, estimated 2009. 90% 2011  <s> confidence Shading interval. surrounding Data labels arefor 1990. 1995 high 2000, 2005 2007, 2009. 2011 and  <s> 2012 The 2009- 2012 change is notsta tistics Ilv significa ntat 90% confidence interval.  <s> Source: Passel Jeffrey S and D'Vera Cohn, 2014 Fuels ""Una uthorized Immigrant Totals Risein  <s> Source: States, Fall Passel in 14: Jeffrey Decline and in Those D'Vera From Cohn, Mexico Fuels ""Una MostState uthorized Immigrant Decreases Totals Washington, Risein  <s> D.C Pew Research Center s Hispanic Trends Project, November.  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ",The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990 .

Context: These political orientations appear to serve as an anchoring point for how knowledge influences peoples ’ attitudes . This pattern is consistent with an array of scholarly literature which suggests that people ’s political worldviews shape how science knowledge influences attitudes on climate - related matters . People ’s level of science knowledge helps to a degree to explain their beliefs about climate change , but the relationship is complicated .

Context: While previous research on the labor market shows that the pandemic has similarly affected mothers and fathers overall from September 2019 to September 2020 , a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that the share of unpartnered mothers who are employed and at work has fallen more precipitously than among other parents . In September 2020 , six months since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak , 67.4 % of unpartnered mothers with children younger than 18 at home were working – employed and on the job – compared with 76.1 % in September 2019 .

7465,"Question: Compare immigrants with native citizens based on whether they have health insurance. Context: Immigrant adults are much more likely than natives to lack health insurance . More than half of unauthorized adults do not have insurance . A principal factor affecting this pattern is that the occupations and industries in which the unauthorized work tend to be those where employers do not provide insurance . Although poverty levels for children are higher than those of adults , children are more likely to have health insurance than adults . This pattern undoubtedly reflects the availability of coverage through the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) in recent years . Children of immigrants are less likely to be covered by health insurance than children of natives , reflecting their higher levels of poverty and the lack of insurance on the part of their parents . Here again , the status of the child has a separate effect on coverage as U.S.-born children of immigrants are more likely to have insurance than children who are immigrants themselves . Legal immigrant children , while having high levels without insurance ( 25 % ) , are much more likely to be covered than unauthorized children ( 59 % ) . Here , the children are not eligible for SCHIP because of their status and their parents generally do not have coverage for themselves or their families . <s> Lack of Health Insurance  <s> Much Higher Among Unauthorized  <s> Percent without Health Insurance 2004  <s> 59%  <s> Children  <s> Adults  <s> Natives  <s> 53%  <s> (by Parents Status)  <s> (by Status)  <s> Immigrants  <s> 25% 25%  <s> 25%  <s> 14%  <s> 13%  <s> 9%  <s> Natives  <s> Legal  <s> Unauthorized  <s> Natives  <s> Legal  <s> Unauthorized  <s> Immigrants  <s> Migrants  <s> Immigrants  <s> Migrants ","Immigrant adults are much more likely than natives to lack health insurance .

6370,"Question: Describe the trust level of different news sources. Context: The full population picture does n’t tell the whole story . If you look simply at the total percentage of online adults who say they trust a news organization for news about government and politics , several mainstream television outlets rise to the top . CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four - in - ten web - using U.S. adults . These high numbers , though , are intertwined with the fact that more than nine - in - ten respondents have heard of these five news sources . Trust and distrust were only asked of sources respondents had heard of , thus , the better known a source is , the more Americans in total who can voice trust or distrust of that source . A source like The Economist , on the other hand , is known by just 34 % of respondents and so could never have a trust level exceeding 34 % — even if everyone who had heard of it trusted it . What about the ratio of trust to distrust ? Another way to think of trust is to compare trust and distrust in a news source . In other words , what is the ratio of people who trust a news outlet to those who distrust it ? This ratio is based just on those who have rated the sources as trusted or distrusted , regardless of how well known the source is . The result is a different list of news brands : The Economist , BBC , NPR , PBS and The Wall Street Journal are among those with the highest ratio of trust to distrust – even if the overall percentages of those who trust them are smaller than for some other sources . Only 34 % of online Americans , for example , have heard of The Economist , but there is far more trust ( 12 % ) than distrust ( 2 % ) when it comes to news about government and politics ( 20 % neither trust nor distrust The Economist ) . The BBC is recognized by a greater portion of respondents ( 76 % ) , but is similarly more trusted ( 36 % ) than distrusted ( 7 % ) . <s> News Sources With Greatest Ratio of  <s> Trust to Distrust  <s> Percent of total respondents who trust and  <s> distrust the sources  <s> Trust Distrust  <s> TRUST/DISTRUST  <s> RATIO  <s> Economist 12% 2%  <s> 5.7 to  <s> BBC  <s> 36  <s> 4.8to  <s> NPR  <s> 29  <s> 3.2to  <s> PBS  <s> 38  <s> 12  <s> 3.1 to  <s> Wall Street  <s> 31 10  <s> 3.1 to  <s> Journal  <s> American Trends Panel (wave 1).

Access to health care is strongly influenced by the options available . Hispanics often work for employers who do not provide coverage . At the same time , disparities are not as large among the elderly because of Medicare ’s wide coverage .

Context: In a few weeks , world leaders will gather in Paris to negotiate a climate change agreement that will frame the global agenda on this issue for the next decade and beyond . As a new Pew Research Center survey illustrates , there is a global consensus that climate change is a significant challenge . Majorities in all 40 nations polled say it is a serious problem , and a global median of 54 % consider it a very serious problem . Moreover , a median of 78 % support the idea of their country limiting greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international agreement in Paris . However , according to most respondents , confronting climate change will entail more than just policy changes ; it will also require significant changes in how people live . A global median of 67 % say that in order to reduce the effects of climate change , people will have to make major changes in their lives . A median of just 22 % believe technology can solve this problem without requiring major changes . Even in the U.S. , a country known for its technological innovations , 66 % believe people will need to significantly alter their lifestyles . In most countries , publics tend to believe that much of the burden for dealing with climate change should be shouldered by wealthier countries . Across the nations polled , a median of 54 % agree with the statement “ Rich countries , such as the U.S. , Japan and Germany , should do more than developing countries because they have produced most of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions so far . ” A median of just 38 % believe that “ Developing countries should do just as much as rich countries because they will produce most of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions in the future . ” However , in six countries , half or more say developing nations should do just as much . Half of Americans hold this view , while 40 % think rich countries should do more .

3806,"Question: What is the public's view of US counterterrorism efforts and prosecutors obtaining AP phone records through a court order? Context: By comparison , the Washington Post / ABC News survey described the situation as follows : The AP reported classified information about U.S. anti - terrorism efforts and prosecutors have obtained AP ’s phone records through a court order . Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified ? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified , by a 52%-33 % margin . The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation . First , Pew Research referred to the decision to subpoena phone records while the WP / ABC survey said the records were obtained … through a court order , which may make the actions seem more legitimate by highlighting a court ’s involvement . Second , what Pew Research described as classified information the WP / ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti - terrorism efforts ; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism . Third , Pew Research mentioned the Justice Department , while WP / ABC mentioned federal prosecutors . It is likely that the DOJ , as a more political institution associated with the administration , is viewed less favorably than are prosecutors .

6487,"Question: Compare work during pregnancy over the decades. Context: Young ’s situation of working while pregnant is much more common today than it was before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act . Among women who had their first child in the early 1960s , just 44 % worked at all during pregnancy . The likelihood that an American woman would work while pregnant increased dramatically through the 1960s and 1970s , and by the late 1980s , 67 % of women pregnant with their first child remained on the job . Those rates have leveled off since then , and the latest figures show that 66 % of mothers who gave birth to their first child between 2006 and 2008 worked during their pregnancy , according to Census Bureau data . The data suggest that not only are a higher share of women expecting their first child continuing to work , but they are working longer into their pregnancy . In the early 1960s , most working women pregnant with their first child ( 65 % ) stopped working more than a month before the birth , while just about a third ( 35 % ) continued working into their final month . By the late 2000s , that trend had reversed . About eight - in - ten pregnant workers ( 82 % ) continued in the workplace until within one month of their first birth , compared with just 18 % who stopped working before then .

3406,"Question: Which country has less of their majority using social networking sites? Context: Internet users in emerging countries are relatively advanced in their use of social media , compared with the U.S. Even though a smaller share of adults are online in other countries , those who use the internet are avid social media users . Our latest U.S. survey shows that 73 % of internet users are social networking site users . By comparison , in 20 of 24 nations surveyed , seven - in - ten or more internet users participate in sites like Facebook and Twitter , including slightly less than nine - in - ten internet users in Egypt ( 88 % ) , Russia ( 86 % ) , and the Philippines ( 86 % ) . Only in China do less than a majority of internet users access a social networking site . That means that many of the countries in our global survey show a higher share of internet users as social media aficionados . However , it is important to note that internet access is much less common in all of these emerging and developing countries compared to the U.S. , so as a total proportion of the population social networking usage is still practiced only among a minority in most of the countries surveyed . But those who go online in poorer countries are early adopters and they are enthusiastic to try the newest digital technology applications . Thus , these countries have a relatively modest share of their entire population online , but those who are online are eager for social media to a greater degree than Americans are . <s> Social Networking Use in Selected States, Countries  <s> Compared with the United States, 2013  <s> Percent ofof internet users who use social networking sites  <s> 100%  <s> 88  <s> 86  <s> 79  <s> 73  <s> 75  <s> 73%  <s> U.S  <s> 48%  <s> 50  <s> 25  <s> China  <s> Brazil  <s> Turkey  <s> Egypt  <s> Russia  <s> Note: Internet users in the U.S represent adults who said they use the internet or  <s> email or connect via mobile device at least occasionally.""

4546,"Question: How has the public evaluated job news? Context: As views of overall economic news have become less negative , perceptions of news from economic sectors have improved as well . Following a week of large stock market gains , about as many say they are hearing mixed news about financial markets ( 43 % ) as say they are hearing mostly bad news ( 38 % ) . Last month , more said the news was mostly bad rather than mixed ( by 50 % to 41 % ) . In August , more than twice as many were hearing mostly bad news than mixed news ( 69 % vs. 25 % ) .

Context: The graph shows the percentage approving of interracial dating for each of four cohorts ( or generations ) , tracking their responses across the 13 separate waves of polling between 1987 and 2009 . Several things are evident from the graph . One is that there is an upward trend in acceptance of interracial dating in most cohorts as time passes . For instance , just 36 % of the “ Silent ” generation ( born before 1946 ) approved in the first interviews in 1987 , but by 2009 , 67 % of members of this cohort approved . Another conclusion from the graph is that each younger cohort is more supportive than the cohorts that preceded it . Baby Boomers were more supportive in 1987 than members of the Silent Generation , and remained that way throughout .

6243,"Question: Explain the relationship between not learning about the election and ideological consistency. Context: About one - in - ten Americans ( 9 % ) did not learn about this year ’s presidential election in a given week from any of 11 types of sources asked about in a January Pew Research Center survey . One striking trait of this group is their lack of faith in the impact of voting . American adults ages 18 to 29 are more likely than any other age group to have not learned about the election . In total , 17 % of them did not learn from any type of source , nearly double that of the next highest age group ( though the vast majority of younger adults – 83 % – did learn about the election ) . This corresponds to earlier research showing that younger adults tend to be more politically unengaged . Those with more ideologically consistent views are more likely to have learned about the election than those who had ideologically mixed views . Of those with mixed views , 14 % did n’t learn about the election from any source , which is higher than those who are more consistently liberal or conservative . Recent research has shown that political engagement is increasingly linked to ideological consistency ; it follows that the 9 % who did not learn about the election are both less engaged in the political process and more likely to have mixed ideological views . <s> Those not learning about  <s> the election are more  <s> likely to be young, less  <s> educated and have mixed  <s> ideologi cal views  <s> % who did not learn about the 2016  <s> presidentialelection learn from at least  <s> one source type in the past week  <s> 9%  <s> U.S adults  <s> Women  <s> 11  <s> 6  <s> Men  <s> 18-29  <s> 17  <s> 30-49  <s> 9  <s> 50-64  <s> 5  <s> 65+  <s> White  <s> All nonwhite  <s> 12  <s> <$30K  <s> 12  <s> $30K-674.999  <s> 9  <s> $75K+  <s> High school or less  <s> 12  <s> Some college  <s> 9  <s> College or  <s> 5  <s> graduate degree  <s> Ideological consistency  <s> Consistent liberal  <s> Lean liberal  <s> Mixed  <s> 14  <s> Lean conservative  <s> 8  <s> Consistent cons.  <s> Source: Survey conducted Jan. 12-27,  <s> 2016.  <s> PEW RESEARCH CENTER ","Those with more ideologically consistent views are more likely to have learned about the election than those who had ideologically mixed views .

4985,"Question: What were trends in public viewing online news of campaign? Context: On a day - to - day basis , interest in online campaign news peaked around Election Day . Fully 12 % of Americans went online for political news on November 7 , and 18 % went online the day after the election — a more than fourfold increase in the normal traffic for political news . The continuing drama of the post - election story and its fast - moving pace kept people online for election news in the week following November 7 . Between 11 % and 15 % of all Americans followed the story online on any given day during this period . The current poll was conducted as part of a larger effort to track Internet use over time . The Pew Internet & amp ; American Life Project has been conducting a daily tracking poll almost continually since March 1 , 2000 , measuring online usage . The level of campaign news consumption remained remarkably stable from March through October ; during this period , roughly 3 % to 5 % of Americans got campaign news online on a typical day .

Context: With this increase , the number of those using a search engine on a typical day is pulling ever closer to the 60 % of internet users who use email , arguably the internet ’s all - time killer app , on a typical day.1 Underscoring the dramatic increase over time , the percentage of internet users who search on a typical day grew 69 % from January 2002 , when the Pew Internet & amp ; American Life Project first tracked this activity , to May 2008 , when the current data were collected . During the same six - year time period , the use of email on a typical day rose from 52 % to 60 % , for a growth rate of just 15 % . These new figures propel search further out of the pack , well ahead of other popular internet activities , such as checking the news , which 39 % of internet users do on a typical day , or checking the weather , which 30 % do on a typical day . This chart shows the percentage of internet users who did these activities “ yesterday , ” which in a tracking survey like this one yields a picture of the “ typical day ” online .

5228,"Question: Describe the trend of duties as a share of the total value of dutiable imports and all imports? Context: In 2016 , according to the World Bank , the average applied U.S. tariff across all products was 1.61 % ; that was about the same as the average rate of 1.6 % for the 28 - nation EU , and not much higher than Japan ’s 1.35 % . Among other major U.S. trading partners , Canada ’s average applied tariff rate was 0.85 % , China ’s was 3.54 % and Mexico ’s was 4.36 % . ( Those average rates are weighted by product import shares with all of each nation ’s trading partners , and do n’t necessarily reflect the provisions of specific trade deals . Under NAFTA , for instance , most trade between the U.S. , Canada and Mexico is duty - free . ) That generations - long debate can be seen in the oscillations of U.S. tariff levels throughout history . In 1821 , when reliable tariff statistics begin , nearly all imports ( 95.5 % ) were taxed , and duties imposed equaled 43.2 % of the total value of all imports and 45 % of the dutiable value . For the next 100 + years , U.S. trade policy followed a fairly predictable pattern : When Democrats controlled the levers of power , tariff rates were lower ; when Whigs or Republicans regained control , rates were higher . The culmination of this perennial drama – what one contemporary writer called “ an endless performance in which the actors are unskilled and the audience dissatisfied ; and yet the same old play is staged over and over and over again ” – was the infamous Smoot - Hawley Tariff of 1930 , which raised import duties on thousands of agricultural and industrial goods . By 1932 , U.S. tariffs equaled 59.1 % of the value of dutiable imports , the highest level since 1830 . Although duties represented only 19.6 % of the value of all imports ( since by that time around two - thirds of imported goods were duty - free ) , that was still the highest level since before World War I. A 1995 survey of economic historians found broad agreement that Smoot - Hawley exacerbated the Great Depression , though to what extent is still debated . <s> Once highly protective.

The meeting comes as the organization continues to draw scrutiny from the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church , and also at a time when there has been a steep decline in the number of nuns . In addition to Vatican scrutiny , nuns also face a big challenge in their dwindling ranks . The total number of nuns , also called religious sisters , in the United States has fallen from roughly 180,000 in 1965 to about 50,000 in 2014 – a 72 % drop over those 50 years – according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) at Georgetown University .

5510,"Question: Tell some information about Naturalization rate of Mexicans vs. other immigrant groups? Context: The overall percentage of lawful immigrants to the United States choosing to apply for and gaining citizenship is at its highest level in more than two decades . Yet in terms of naturalization rate , Mexicans – the single largest group of lawful immigrants by country of origin – lag well behind green - card holders eligible to apply from other parts of the globe . Based on Pew Research Center estimates using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available , two - thirds ( 67 % ) of lawful immigrants eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015 . This is the highest share since at least the mid-1990s . But among Mexican lawful immigrants eligible to apply , only 42 % had applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship by 2015 , a rate little changed since 2005 and one of the lowest among all immigrant groups when it comes to country of origin . As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green - card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2 - percentage - point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non - Mexican immigrants . <s> Naturalization rate of Mexicans vs. other immigrant  <s> groups, 1995 to 2015  <s> % naturalized among immigrants eligible to become USS citizens  <s> 80  <s> Other  <s> 74  <s> 68  <s> 60  <s> 54  <s> Mexico  <s> 40  <s> 42  <s> 38  <s> 20  <s> 20  <s> 2000  <s> 2005  <s> 2010  <s> 2015  <s> 1995  <s> Note: Natura lization is the process through which U.S lawful permanentresidents who  <s> fulfill length of stay and other requirements become y.

5455,"Question: Describe how different ethnic groups share of voters change since 2012 ? Context: A number of long - standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or stalled in 2016 , as black voter turnout decreased , white turnout increased and the nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate remained flat since the 2012 election . Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau ’s report , the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters . The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election , falling to 59.6 % in 2016 after reaching a record - high 66.6 % in 2012 . The 7 - percentage - point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks . ( It ’s also the largest percentage - point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2 % in 1992 to 60.7 % in 1996 . ) The number of black voters also declined , falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016 , representing a sharp reversal from 2012 . With Barack Obama on the ballot that year , the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time . Among whites , the 65.3 % turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1 % in 2012 . The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6 % in 2016 , compared with 48.0 % in 2012 . Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long - awaited , historic surge in Latino voters . Due largely to demographic growth , the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016 , up from 11.2 million in 2012 . Even so , the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot , or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters , a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996 . Meanwhile , the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3 % in 2016 , up from 46.9 % in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996 . Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics : Overall , about 5 million Asians voted in 2016 , up from 3.8 million in 2012 . The number of naturalized - citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016 , up from 9.3 million in 2012 . In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign , turnout among naturalized - citizen voters ( those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens ) was 54.3 % , up from 53.6 % in 2012 . Overall , the voter turnout rate among foreign - born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters , who had a 62.1 % turnout rate in 2016 . But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation ’s two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed . In 2016 , turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9 % , compared with 44.9 % for U.S.-born Asians . Among Hispanics , naturalized - citizen turnout was 53.4 % , higher than the 45.5 % turnout for U.S.-born Hispanics . <s> Black voter turnout state declined sharply in 2016,  <s> dropping below that of whites  <s> % of eligible voters who say they voted  <s> 75%  <s> 65. 3% White  <s> 65  <s> 59 6 Black  <s> 55  <s> 49. .3 Asian  <s> 47.6 Hispanic  <s> 45  <s> 1992  <s> 1996  <s> 2000  <s> 2004  <s> 2008  <s> 2012 2016  <s> 1988  <s> Note: Eligible voters are U.S citizens ages 18 and older.
