About half of 2.2 million people who sought asylum in Europe during the 2015 and 2016 refugee surge were still in limbo at the end of 2016 and did not know if they would be allowed to stay.

When we looked at which countries are hosting the most refugees relative to their populations, Lebanon was far and away the leader. Our analysis, which used 2014 data from the UNHCR and international population estimates from the Census Bureau, found that the 1.15 million refugees in Lebanon last year – nearly all of them fleeing the civil war in neighboring Syria – represent nearly 20 % of that country ’s population of 5.9 million. In second place was Jordan, where refugees – also nearly all from Syria – represent more than 8 % of the population. Other nations
Compared with seniors, younger adults are more inclined to like trying new technology products. These age differences are in keeping with previous Pew Research Center surveys that found younger adults more likely to be interested in science and technology and more likely to own technology products such as smartphones, tablets and computers. And while men and women have similar preferences, index scores suggest that men under age 50 are more likely than either older men or women at any age to prefer new technology products. Technology products have typically come on the market with a high price tag that is out of reach for many consumers. Thus, not

And less than half the public is satisfied with the way democracy is working in Japan, while

While Twitter users are just as likely as others to consume news on any given day, they are more likely to consume it on mobile devices and less likely to engage with news via more traditional outlets. Twitterers are less likely to read a printed copy of a newspaper, but more likely to read a newspaper online, and more likely to read a news story on a cell phone or on a smart phone. A similar pattern holds for video news consumption ; on any given day, Twitter users are just as likely as others to watch news on a TV, and just as

( For example, about 10 % of members in the first and much smaller Congress
The Trump administration and governments in Ottawa and Mexico City have indicated they will renegotiate the trilateral, quarter - century - old North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ). While the existing accord enjoys the support of roughly three - quarters of the Canadian public and six - in - ten Mexicans, it is viewed less favorably in the United States, with Republicans far less supportive than Democrats, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of all three countries.

Clinton was still a viable candidate for the nomination ). For instance, 84 % of the French who are following the race have confidence in Obama, compared with 60 % confident in Clinton. This suggests that Obama ’s appeal among Europeans may be driven by more than just his party affiliation.

But opinions vary on what ’s causing the planet

Seven companies showed revenue declines year - to - year, with Scripps ( -21 % ) and Washington Post Co. ( -18 % ) suffering the biggest losses.
The most immediately striking thing about the JOLTS numbers is how flat hiring has been for some time. February ’s seasonally adjusted hiring rate — defined as hires as a percentage of total nonfarm employment — was 3.3 %, the same as it ’s been since October last year. In fact, there ’s been no significant improvement in the hiring rate for nearly three years. By comparison, the hiring rate before the Great Recession typically was at or near 4 %.

Overall, 19 % of the public paid very close attention to news about the fired U.S. attorneys and 8 % said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. The news media devoted 16 %

Majorities in the Middle East also agree with this perspective.

While many U.S. Muslims say they attend mosque and pray regularly, sizable shares also say that there is more than one way to interpret their religion and that traditional understandings of Islam need to be reinterpreted to address the issues of today. By some conventional measures, U.S. Muslims are as religious as – or more religious than – many Americans who belong to other faith groups. Four - in - ten ( 43 % ) Muslim Americans say they

In Nigeria, 37 % say a strong relationship with China is more important, compared with just 17 % who say this about the U.S. (

Median annual household income for Indian Americans in 2010 was $ 88,000, much higher than for all Asian Americans ( $ 66,000 ) and all U.S. households ( $ 49,800 ) — perhaps not surprising, given their high education levels. Only 9 % of adult Indian Americans live in poverty, compared with 12 % of Asian Americans overall and 13 % of the U.S. population. In 2010, by our analysis, 28 % of Indian American worked in science and engineering fields ; according

Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president, with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ).

Bush, 45 % to 37 %, with 17 % supporting Perot. Clinton

This escalated loss of migrants fueled the island ’s first sustained population decline in its history as a U.S. territory, even as the stateside Puerto Rican population grew briskly.
