For a national cellphone sample , this reduces the estimated net coverage rate of U.S. adults from about 91 % to 83 % . These net rates are based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s January to June 2015 National Health Interview Survey that 3 % of adults have no telephone and another 6 % have a landline but no cellphone . For national RDD surveys of adults , the inclusion of a landline sample substantially mitigates the reduction in coverage from excluding flagged - inactive numbers ( from 97 % coverage to 93 % , rather than 83 % ) . While excluding flagged - inactive cellphones reduces the survey coverage rate and disproportionately excludes hard - to - reach demographic groups , it does not appear to have a meaningful effect on bias , at least for public opinion surveys .

Based on Pew Research Center estimates using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available , two - thirds ( 67 % ) of lawful immigrants eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015 . This is the highest share since at least the mid-1990s . But among Mexican lawful immigrants eligible to apply , only 42 % had applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship by 2015 , a rate little changed since 2005 and one of the lowest among all immigrant groups when it comes to country of origin . As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green - card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2 - percentage - point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non - Mexican immigrants"
