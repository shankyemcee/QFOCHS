A 1947 law dictates that only a male can ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne, but there had been no princes born to the royal family since 1965, leading many to call for changing the law so a female \u2014 most likely four - year - old Princess Aiko \u2014 could eventually rule. The results of a recent Pew Global Attitudes survey show that the Japanese public was ready for just such a change : 76 % would have favored amending the Imperial Household Act to allow a female to take the throne."
