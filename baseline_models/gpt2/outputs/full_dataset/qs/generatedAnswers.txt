4 Married adults have higher levels of relationship satisfaction and trust than those living with a partner. Married adults are more likely than those who are living with a partner to say things are going very well in their relationship ( 58 % vs. 41 % ). They also express higher levels of satisfaction with specific aspects of their relationship, including the way household chores are divided between them and their spouse or partner, how well their spouse or partner balances work and personal life, how well they and their spouse or partner communicate, and their spouse ’s or partner ’s approach to parenting ( among those with children younger than 18 in the household )
Americans are closely divided on the issue of whether the marches will increase public support for science : 44 % think they will help and 44 % think they will make no difference. Another 7 % believe they will hurt public support. Most Democrats and Democratic leaners ( 61 % ) believe the marches and demonstrations held in April will benefit public support for science. By contrast, just 22 % of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP say the marches will help drive public support for science. By contrast, just 22 % of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP say the marches will hurt public support.
In the economic realm, most see rewards and opportunities going primarily to those at the top. Majorities in all three nations say the gap between rich and poor has increased over the past five years. And when asked why so many people lack jobs in their country, the top reason given is that many jobs go only to people with connections.
In the same survey, nearly half of U.S. adults ( 46 % ) named local news outlets as a major source for COVID-19 news – more than the share who named several other groups, including President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force ( 31 % ). Other local information sources were seen as important as well : For example, 36 % of adults said state and local elected officials were a major source of news about the outbreak, while 16 % said the same about friends, family and neighbors, and 8 % named community newsletters or Listservs. In all, 64 % of U.S. adults name
Sub - Saharan Africa has experienced dramatic gains in internet use in recent years. With this rapid growth in connectivity have come a host of potential problems, including fake news, political targeting and manipulation and financial scams, among others. Yet according to a new Pew Research Center analysis, most sub - Saharan Africans feel positively about the role the internet plays in their country. Large majorities say the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on education in their country, and half or more say the same about the economy, personal relationships and politics. Only when it comes to the issue of morality are sub - Saharan Africans somewhat more divided abou
The preference for news without a political point of view is even stronger when it comes to online news : 74 % of those who get news online want it to come without a political point of view, while just 19 % prefer online sources that have a point of view.
More than one - in - five named the campaign as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week. This placed the campaign on par with the war in Iraq as one of the week ’s two most closely followed stories. Democrats paid much closer attention to the campaign than Republicans : 36 % of Democrats vs. 23 % of Republicans followed campaign news very closely. Public interest in the Iraq war remained high despite relatively little news coverage More than three - in - ten Americans followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 20 % listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. Coverage of the Iraq policy debat
6 Most grads think college was worth it. The same Pew Research report found that majorities of graduates in all three of the largest U.S. generations — Boomers, Gen - Xers and Millennials — agree that college either has paid off or will pay off, given what they and their families invested in it. Perhaps not surprisingly, the highest - earning graduates were the most positive about their educations — 98 % of those making six figures and up said their degree had paid off, compared with 63 % of graduates earning less than $ 50,000. Similarly, people with advanced degrees were even more likely than bachelor ’s an
Among 37 countries surveyed globally in 2017, Trump received his lowest ratings on this question in Mexico, where 93 % said they have no confidence in the U.S. leader. His proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border was also particularly unpopular in the United States ’ southern neighbor, where 94 % said they disapproved of the project.
The public has grown more supportive of the U.S. fight against ISIS, as about twice as many approve ( 63 % ) as disapprove ( 30 % ) of the military campaign against the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria. Last October, 57 % approved and 33 % disapproved.
Europeans overwhelmingly give the U.N. favorable reviews. More than seven - in - ten in France ( 74 % ) and Poland ( 72 % ) offer a favorable opinion, as do majorities in Britain ( 67 % ), Germany ( 65 % ), Spain ( 61 % ) and Russia ( 56 % ). The organization is also widely popular in the two African countries surveyed, Kenya ( 76 % favorable ) and Nigeria ( 71 % ), and to a lesser extent in two of the three Latin American nations included, Mexico ( 58 % ) and Brazil ( 52 % ). In Argentina, however, nearly half ( 45 %

In order to have a larger sample of Hispanics in June, we surveyed 543 Hispanics out of 2,245 total respondents, or 24 % of the unweighted sample. This gave us a much larger sample to analyze, and made the estimates for Hispanics more precise.
The 2015 survey of Latino adults also shows that among Hispanic registered voters, 81 % say speaking Spanish is not required to be considered Hispanic.
41 % say Obama will do better, while 37 % expect Romney to prevail.
The share of the public saying that Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence has dropped four percentage points since a historical high of 50 % in September 2014.

Independents remain split over this question : 45 % say Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions, while the same proportion ( 45 % ) say it is not.
In 2010, nearly one in five U.S. households ( 19 % ) owed money on student loans in 2010, more than double the proportion in 1989. Among households headed by someone younger than 35 ( i.e., people more likely to be recent college graduates ), a record 40 % had student - loan debt outstanding.
A 2018 Center survey found that some Facebook users had recently taken steps to moderate their use of the site – such as deleting the Facebook app from their phone or taking a break from the platform for some time. But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies, Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago. Roughly three - quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily, including about half who do so several times a day.
Indeed, in our focus groups, many teachers suggest that despite being raised in the “ digital age, ” today ’s students are surprisingly lacking in their online search skills. Students receive the lowest marks for “ patience and determination in looking for information that is hard to find, ” with 43 % of teachers rating their students “ poor ” in this regard, and another 35 % rating their students “ fair. ” Indeed, in our focus groups, many teachers suggest that despite being raised in the “ digital age, ” today ’s students are surprisingly lacking in their online search skills. Student
When asked to describe QAnon, people most often mentioned that it was a group of some kind ( 41 % ) or a conspiracy group or theory ( 44 % ). When Americans who said they had heard at least a little about QAnon were asked to write in their own words what they thought it was, they were most likely to describe it as a group of some kind or include a more specific description of it as a conspiracy group or theory. Far fewer wrote in other kinds of descriptions.
About half ( 52 % ) say that the press has done only a fair or poor job in covering campaign strategies and the same percentage says this about coverage of the candidates ’ positions on issues. Somewhat fewer view coverage of these two aspects of the campaign positively. In both cases, 44 % say that campaign reporting has been excellent or good. The area in which the public sees the greatest weakness in campaign coverage is in news about the candidates ’ personal backgrounds and experiences. A majority ( 54 % ) say that the press has done only a fair or poor job, while roughly four - in - ten ( 41 % ) say the coverag
Half of Russians also agree with the statement “ it is a great misfortune that the Soviet Union no longer exists ; ” 36 % disagree. This is a slight decline from 2009, when 58 % agreed and 38 % disagreed. Russians ages 50 and older tend to express more nostalgia for the Soviet era than do those under 50.
The number of desktop owners with laptop owners considering past years.As noted in previous reports, desktop computer ownership has fallen slightly since 2006, as laptops have gained in popularity.
In 2010, Pew Research surveyed publics in a number of countries, seven of which are also represented in this pay gap data, about whether “ men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well, even when women are as qualified as men for the job. ” Majorities in all seven countries agreed with the statement. Agreement ranged from about seven - in - ten in the U.S. and Spain ( 68 % ), and up to more than eight - in - ten in Poland ( 83 % ) and Germany ( 84 % ).
The 2018 midterm elections are still more than a year away, but the two groups at either end of the political typology are already highly motivated by the battle for congressional control. More than eight - in - ten Solid Liberals ( 84 % ) say it matters a great deal to them which party wins control of Congress next year, the highest share of any typology group. Core Conservatives are next highest, at 77 %. At this point, other groups are less engaged by the struggle for partisan control of Congress. And the drop - off is particularly notable among three groups close to the middle of the typology. On the right, fewer tha
A Pew Research Center analysis of government data published earlier this month found that 36 % of the nation ’s young adults ages 18 to 31 — the so - called Millennial generation — were living in their parents ’ home in 2012. This was the highest share in at least four decades and represented a slow but steady increase over the 32 % of their same - aged counterparts who were living at home prior to the Great Recession in 2007. The growing gender parity in likelihood of residing at home is especially pronounced among 18- to 24 - year - olds : 60 % of men and 52 % of women in that age group lived at home i
Americans paid close attention last week to three story lines with links to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. In addition to interest in the possible Koran burning ( 33 % very closely ), the public also very closely tracked news about developments in Afghanistan ( 30 % ) and Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations ( 33 % ). Nearly as many ( 9 % ) say they followed news about the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks most closely. News about commemorations made up 2 % of coverage. More than two - in - ten ( 22 % ) say they followed news about this year ’s congressional elections very closely. This wa
The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Oct. 25 - 30 among 1,504 adults, finds that Trump ’s job rating is lower than it was in June and February ( 39 % on each occasion ). Most Americans continue to have strong feelings about the president, with about twice as many strongly disapproving of his job performance as strongly approving ( 51 % to 25 % ). Since earlier this year, approval ratings for the congressional leaders of both parties have fallen – largely because fewer Republicans and Democrats are expressing positive views of their own parties ’ leaders.
In contrast to views of news about the oil spill, the public ’s perceptions of economic news have not changed and remain far more negative than positive. Currently, 55 % say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about t he economy, while 38 % say the economic news they are hearing is mostly bad and just 4 % say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy. That is little changed from early July, when 54 % said they were hearing mixed news, and 42 % said they were hearing mostly bad news. In June, however, just 30 % said they were hearing mostly bad news and 65 % said th
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the only world leader included in the survey who receives more positive than negative reviews. Across the 37 nations polled, a median of 42 % express confidence in her, while 31 % say they lack confidence.

About half ( 52 % ) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey, while 37 % say it is having a bad influence. Turks are divided on many of the other major institutions in their country. Nearly equal numbers say that the police, national government and religious leaders are either a good or bad influence. About four - in - ten ( 41 % ) say that the court system has a good effect on the nation, but 48 % rate its influence as bad.
The Chinese public stands out from others surveyed in saying they prefer teaching both sets of skills. More than a quarter of Chinese volunteer that schools should emphasize both creative thinking and basic skills and discipline.
Women, blacks, Asians and Hispanics have built up substantial positions as business owners in several sectors of the U.S. economy. But based on revenue, those businesses are on average considerably smaller than white- or male - owned firms, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall, men owned more than half of the nation ’s 27.6 million firms in 2012, according to preliminary results from the Survey of Business Owners, and women owned more than 9.9 million businesses, about 36 % of the total. The remaining 10 % of firms were either jointly owned b
The Iraq war was the news story the public followed most closely last week. Nearly a third of the public ( 32 % ) followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 25 % listed this as the story they followed most closely. The percentage of Americans following the war has remained remarkably steady throughout the year. The national news media devoted 10 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq last week and 5 % to the Iraq policy debate. Coverage of the Iraq policy debate declined sharply from the previous week when Gen. Petraeus ’ report to Congress and Bush ’s prime - time address made it the top news story.
Voter registration rates have declined since 2008, especially among young people. In interviews conducted over the course of 2012 so far, 72 % of adults 18 and older say they are absolutely certain they are registered to vote. This is lower than in 2008, when 79 % were registered to vote and in 2004 ( 76 % registered to vote ). In polls conducted from January to September, just half of those under 30 are certain they are registered to vote – 11 points lower than in 2008 – and the lowest number in the past 16 years of Pew Research Center polling. There also has been a nine - point decline in voter registration among those 30
Nearly two - thirds of Democrats ( 64 % ) say there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were harder for people to legally obtain guns ; only about a quarter of Republicans ( 27 % ) say the same.

Younger adult Americans consume more digital video and digital news video than older ones. Nearly half of adults ages 18 to 29 watch online news video. That substantially outpaces that of older Americans. And it stands in contrast with surveys showing that when it comes to television news viewing habits, 18 - 29 year - olds tend to watch less than any other age group. More highly educated and wealthier Americans are more likely to watch digital news video. Slightly more than half of Americans with a bachelor or graduate degree from college ( 52 % ) watch news video online. This is moderately higher than the video news viewing of those who completed some college ( 43
The study looked at changes in educational attainment across three recent generations, finding that the youngest generation of Muslim adults analyzed ( born 1976 to 1985 ) have far more formal education than those in the oldest generation analyzed ( born 1936 to 1955 ). While both men and women are contributing to these gains, women have been gaining at a faster rate. The oldest Muslim women in the study averaged just 2.5 years of schooling, compared with 4.6 years for men – a gap of 2.1 years.
Support of President Obama and his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, has declined among Hispanics over the past six months, even though the popularity of both is nearly unchanged among the public overall, according to a new analysis of Pew Research Center survey data. Today, as many Hispanics approve as disapprove ( 47%-47 % ) of the new health care law. That ’s down markedly compared with the 61 % approval just six months ago.

About eight - in - ten Republicans ( 82 % ) are very concerned when it comes to Islamic extremism in the world and 71 % are very concerned about the U.S. specifically ; among Democrats, about half ( 51 % ) are very concerned internationally and 46 % nationally.
Older Americans are more opposed to the use of military force than those in other age groups, but most believe that, in principle, the best way to ensure peace is through military strength rather than effective diplomacy. Americans under age 30 generally favor the opposite approach. Since 1987, the belief in military strength as the best way to ensure peace has never fallen below 60 % among those ages 65 and older, while on average only 44 % of younger Americans subscribe to that opinion.

A 47 - nation survey finds global public opinion increasingly wary of the world ’s dominant nations and disapproving of their leaders. Anti - Americanism is extensive, as it has been for the past five years. At the same time, the image of China has slipped significantly among the publics of other major nations. Opinion about Russia is mixed, but confidence in its president, Vladimir Putin, has declined sharply. In fact, the Russian leader ’s negatives have soared to the point that they mirror the nearly worldwide lack of confidence in George W. Bush.
About three - quarters of the public ( 74 % ) say it is “ very important ” for the country. Among five current issues tested, only proposed changes to the federal tax system rank as important as sexual assault and harassment in the public ’s view. Democrats and Democratic leaners are 20 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to view the issue of sexual assault and harassment as very important. Nonetheless, nearly nine - in - ten Republicans ( 87 % ) say it is at least somewhat important. Very few Republicans or Democrats regard this issue as not important. More women than men say the issue of sexual assault an

Between February 2005 and August 2006, the use of social networking sites among young adult internet users ages 18 - 29 jumped from 9 % to 49 % ; during this same time period, use of these sites by 30 - 49 year olds remained essentially unchanged. Since then, users under age 30 have continued to be significantly more likely to use social networking sites when compared with every other adult age group.

About half ( 52 % ) of American adults lived in middle - class households in 2016. This is virtually unchanged from the 51 % who were middle class in 2011. But while the size of the nation ’s middle class remained relatively stable, financial gains for middle - income Americans during this period were modest compared with those of higher - income households, causing the income disparity between the groups to grow.

The Hispanic population grew to 53 million in 2012, a 50 % increase since 2000 and nearly six times the population in 1970, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data. Meanwhile, the overall U.S. population increased by only 12 % from 2000 to 2012. Hispanic population growth accounted for more than half of the country ’s growth in this time period. Much of the growth is occurring in a relatively small geographic area. A Pew Research Center analysis last year found that the 10 largest counties by Hispanic population accounted for 22 % of the national Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2011. Half of these counties are located i

Globally, Trump is much less popular than his predecessor. Across 37 countries we surveyed in spring 2017, a median of just 22 % said they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs. In contrast, 64 % expressed confidence in President Barack Obama in these same 37 nations during the final years of his presidency.

The share in the labor force also is relatively high in California ( 9.4 % ) and Texas ( 8.9 % ), which rank second and third in the unauthorized immigrant share of the total population. ( Appendix Table A1 shows the number and share of unauthorized immigrants i
% of Latinos say this, compared with 26 % of whites and 32 % of blacks.

A major reason why emerging and developing nations are more optimistic is that their economies have performed better in recent years. Overall, there is a strong relationship between economic growth and optimism for the next generation. People in countries that have had strong growth since 2008 – such as China, Vietnam and Ghana – are much more likely to say today ’s children will be better off than their parents. In nations hit hard by the Great Recession – such as Greece, Spain and Italy – there is much less optimism.

The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, provides estimates of vacancies, hires, voluntary quits and involuntary separations starting in December 2000. ( The latest JOLTS numbers are from February ; March numbers are due to be released this coming Friday. ) The most immediately striking thing about the JOLTS numbers is how flat hiring has been for some time. February ’s seasonally adjusted hiring rate — defined as hires as a percentage of total nonfarm employment — was 3.3 %, the same as it ’s been since October last year. In fact, there ’s bee

The content of email messages and the people with whom one communicates via email are considerably more sensitive pieces of information when compared with other online activities and associated data trails.
By contrast, smaller religious groups may not have been harassed in as many countries simply because they are not present in as many countries.

More than 1,000 immigrants have been evacuated from southern Italy after a recent wave of violence against African farm workers. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project over the past decade find that anti - immigrant sentiment is widespread in Italy. For example, in 2007, Italians overwhelmingly said that immigration was a big problem in their country and that immigrants — both from the Middle East and North Africa and from Eastern European countries — were having a bad impact on Italy. More recently, in the fall of 2009, more than eight - in - ten Italians ( 94 % ) considered immigration to be a big problem, including 6

This was the second most covered story online, with online sources devoting 15 % of their coverage to th
The answer given by those who have graduated from college is that their feelings of personal satisfaction and economic well - being are about the same, no matter which type of institution they attended, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center survey.

But that figure falls to just 10 % among Republicans from households earning $ 75,000 or more a year. Overall, however, Republicans at all income levels are less likely to support broadband subsidies than Democrats of comparable incomes.

Americans are more likely to prioritize greater cooperation with Germany than Germans are to prioritize increased cooperation with the U.S. About seven - in - ten in the U.S. ( 69 % ) want more cooperation with Germany, compared with half of Germans ( 50 % ) who want more cooperation with the U.S. Instead, Germans are most likely to say they want greater cooperation with France ( 77 % ) and Japan ( 69 % ) among the countries tested.
Among Democrats, just 13 % of liberals say the U.S. stands above other nations, compared with 23 % of moderate and conservative Democrats. And nearly three - in - ten liberal Democrats ( 29 % ) say there are other countries better than the U.S. ; only 13 % of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same. Adults 65 and older are the most likely to say the U.S. stands above all other nations ( 44 % ). By contrast, just 12 % of those younger than 30 say the same, the lowest share in any age category. There is little difference in views of the nation ’s globa
In - ten Americans ( 60 % ) now say U.S. troops should be removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible. Just 35 % currently say troops should remain in the country until the situation there has stabilized. By more than three - to - one, Democrats say U.S. troops should be removed as soon as possible ( 73 % ), rather than remain in Afghanistan until the situation stabilizes ( 22 % ). A smaller majority of independents supports a quick withdrawal ( 58 % vs. 38 % remain until stable ). Republicans are evenly divided on this question : 48 % say the troops should be removed as soon as possible
Catholics ’ views on these and similar questions may reflect the fact that American Catholics themselves are experiencing family life in all its modern complexity. One - quarter of Catholics say they have been divorced, including one - in - ten who are now remarried. And fully 44 % of U.S. Catholics say they have lived together with a romantic partner outside of marriage at some point in their lives, including 9 % who are currently cohabiting.
The apparent coup d’etat in Zimbabwe may bring an end to the 37 - year - long rule of President Robert Mugabe. It ’s the first such seizure of power globally in three years – a reminder of how much rarer coups have become as methods of regime change. Since the end of World War II, there have been 225 successful coups ( counting the events in Zimbabwe ) in countries with populations greater than 500,000, according to the Center for Systemic Peace, which maintains extensive datasets on various forms of armed conflict and political violence. Most coups occurred during the height of the Cold War, fro
Among the nation ’s 10.4 million unauthorized adults, a shrinking share have been in the country for less than five years—15 % in 2012, compared with 38 % in 2000. A rising share have lived in the U.S. for a decade or more—62 % in 2012, compared with 35 % in 2000. About a fifth ( 21 % ) had been in the U.S. for two decades or more as of 2012.
Young adults are especially likely to use their mobile phones to keep themselves occupied while watching television, as nearly three quarters of all cell owners ages 18 - 24 ( 73 % ) used their cell phone in this manner recently. But while this behavior is especially common among the youngest cell owners, a majority of 25 - 34 year olds and just under half of those in their mid-30s to mid-40s have done this recently.
A similar share of Americans report that they read for pleasure, for work or school, or to keep up with current events compared to the most recent time these questions were asked in 2011. However, the share of Americans who read in order to research specific topics of interest has increased by 10 - percentage points over that time frame, from 74 % to 84 %.
The data shows that workers at larger private sector employers are more likely to have paid family leave available. According to the NCS data, 23 % of workers at employers with 500 or more employees had access to the benefit ( up from 17 % in 2010 ), while only 9 % of workers at employers with fewer than 100 employees do
Most Americans ( 61 % ) say “ people are too quick to undergo cosmetic procedures in order to change their appearance in ways that are not really important, ” while a minority 36 % says “ it ’s understandable that more people undergo cosmetic procedures these days because it is a competitive world and people who look more attractive tend to have an advantage.
The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Sept. 25 - 29 among 1,005 adults, finds that 26 % overall say they are angry at the federal government, while 51 % feel frustrated. Just 17 % say they are basically content with the government. As in the past, substantial majorities across the political spectrum are either angry or frustrated with the federal government. But anger at the government is far more widespread among conservative Republicans than other partisan groups. This marks a change from 2011, when political independents ( 30 % angry ) were about as likely as conservative Republicans ( 32 % ) to express anger at the federal government. In th
When asked specifically about Kashmir, a majority of Indians ( 55 % ) see the situation there as a very big problem. More than half ( 53 % ) say circumstances in Kashmir have gotten worse over the last five years, and a majority ( 58 % ) believes the Indian government should use more military force than it uses currently in dealing with tensions in the area.
A new Pew Research Center survey reveals that while men are somewhat more likely to experience any form of online harassment, women report higher levels of emotional stress from their experiences and differ in their attitudes toward the underlying causes of such incidents. There are also gender differences in views of online harassment as a public issue. Seven - in - ten women ( 70 % ) say they see online harassment as a major problem, compared with 54 % of men. Younger women – those ages 18 to 29 – are especially likely to say this : More than eight - in - ten ( 83 % ) say it is a major problem, compared with 55 % of men i
In 2007, confidence in Chavez declined in all of the three Latin American countries included in the 2008 Global Attitudes poll — Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. In Argentina, only a quarter ( 26 % ) held a lot or some confidence in Chavez in 2008, a drop of 14 percentage points from 2007. Similarly in Mexico, confidence ratings in Chavez declined 11 percentage points from 17 % to 6 %. In Brazil, the drop was less substantial, from 17 % to 12 %.
About a quarter ( 27 % ) say they followed coverage of the solemn 9/11 anniversary more closely than any other news. Nearly as many ( 23 % ) say they followed news about the economy most closely. Another 13 % cite President Obama ’s speech to Congress to unveil his jobs plan as their top story, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Sept. 8 - 11 by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press among 1,010 adults.
Americans consistently have expressed little confidence in Putin to do the right thing on world affairs, but Republicans and Democrats differ somewhat in these views. Republicans and Republican - leaning independents are now 21 points more likely than Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents to express confidence in Putin ( 31 % vs. 10 % ), the widest partisan gap on this question in Pew Research Center polling.

Democrats feel warmly toward Clinton, while Republican views of her are very cold. Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure in U.S. politics. In a survey conducted this spring, Democrats give her an average rating of 73 on a 0 - to-100 “ feeling thermometer, ” where 100 is the warmest, most positive rating and zero the coldest, most negative. Republicans, on the other hand, give her an average rating of 12, and 59 % give her a zero on the scale. Republicans ’ deeply negative views of Clinton find a parallel in Democrats ’ deeply negative views of Donald Trump, wh
Half say using military force against countries that may seriously threaten the U.S. – but have not attacked it – can often ( 12 % ) or sometimes ( 38 % ) be justified, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October. About as many ( 48 % ) say such pre - emptive use of military force can rarely ( 28 % ) or never ( 20 % ) be justified. Today, the public is somewhat more likely to express reservations about the use of pre - emptive force than it was eight years ago, when Pew Research Center last asked the question. In November 2009, during President Barack Obama ’
Obama was by far the most visible candidate in the news last week. Two - thirds of the public ( 67 % ) named Obama as the candidate they ’ve been hearing the most about in the news in the past week or so. Roughly one - in - five ( 22 % ) named Clinton and just 2 % named McCain. While Obama has remained the most visible candidate for 13 straight weeks, he has not dominated Clinton and McCain to this extent since mid - March when he gave his speech on race and politics.
Overall, Americans believe there should be a strong connection between local journalists and the communities they serve. But there are again some partisan differences on several measures of that connection. Republicans, for example, are somewhat less likely than Democrats to say local journalists are in touch with the communities they serve ( 61 % of Republicans say this vs. 67 % of Democrats ) and that local news media cover the area where they live ( 49 % vs. 54 % ) and have a lot of local influence ( 34 % vs. 40 % ).
Job approval ratings for both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress are down slightly from mid - summer. Though Republicans may be poised for major gains in the House and Senate in the midterm elections, just 24 % of the public approves of the job being done by the party ’s leaders in Congress. That is down from 33 % in July, and equals a low measured at about the same time last year.
Black Muslims are much more likely than nonblack Muslims to have been born in the United States ( 69 % vs. 36 % ), though less likely than black Christians ( 90 % ).
In Pew ’s 2005 Political Typology ( based on polling in December 2004 ), 77 % of whites, but only 56 % of blacks agreed that the position of blacks in American society has improved in recent years. And while 63 % of whites feel that blacks who ca n’t get ahead are mostly responsible for their own condition, only 43 % of blacks agree, a gap that has stayed virtually constant over the last decade.
A new Pew Research Center survey conducted June 7 - July 5 finds that about six - in - ten Americans ( 59 % ) feel exhausted by the amount of election coverage, while 39 % say they like getting a lot of coverage about the election. This feeling of fatigue is particularly true among those who are n’t following news about the election very closely – 69 % of this group say they are worn out compared with about 41 % of those who follow the election very closely.
Americans are closely divided in their view of the news media ’s coverage of climate change. Some 47 % of U.S. adults say the media does a good job covering global climate change, while 51 % say they do a bad job. A 58 % majority of people following climate news very closely say the media do a good job, however. Conservative Republicans stand out as more negative in their overall views about climate change news coverage.

The 2004 horse pool compares to 1984 and 1988, when the average spread was 2.2 % and 2.3 %, respectively, and slightly above the election of 2000 ( at 1.7 % ). The greatest variability in the polls was seen in 1992, when Ross Perot ’s on - again, off- again candidacy ­ and Bill Clinton ’s rising support in the June - July time frame ­ resulted in average polling variability of 2.9 percentage points. By contrast, the 1996 campaign, when Clinton consistently held a large lead over challenger Bob Dole, saw the least variation from one poll to the other
Overall, 37 % of Americans cite the health care reform debate as the single news story they followed most closely this past week.
U.S. fathers today are spending more time caring for their children than they did a half - century ago. Still, most ( 63 % ) say they spend too little time with their kids and a much smaller share ( 36 % ) say they spend the right amount of time with them, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in August and September 2017.
Among religiously affiliated Southern teens, roughly four - in - ten say they regularly pray before eating lunch at their public school ( 38 % ), compared with smaller shares in the Midwest ( 23 % ), West ( 20 % ) and Northeast ( 13 % ) who say this. Teens in the South ( 31 % ) also are more likely than teens in the West ( 21 % ) and Northeast ( 14 % ) to invite other students to religious youth groups or worship services. There are fewer regional differences among religiously affiliated teens in public schools when it comes to personally wearing religious clothing or jewelry in school. About a third of teens in the Sout
Shifting attitudes toward China are colored, in part, by the context of the continued trade frictions and tariffs between the United States and China. Today, just over half of Americans ( 53 % ) believe current economic ties between the U.S. and China are bad. Fewer ( 41 % ) think economic relations between the two nations are good, with just 2 % of American adults saying ties are very good. Partisanship is associated with views of the U.S.-China economic relationship : While 49 % of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents see current ties as good, around one - third ( 36 % ) of Democrats an
A survey of 3,748 American - based scientists connected with the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) finds that 87 % agree with the statement “ Scientists should take an active role in public policy debates about issues related to science and technology. ” Just 13 % of these scientists back the opposite statement : “ Scientists should focus on establishing sound scientific facts and stay out of public policy debates. ”A survey of 3,748 American - based scientists connected with the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) finds that 87 % agree with the statement “ Scientists should take an active role i
Views of Chinese President Xi Jinping are, on balance, negative across the 34 countries surveyed. A median of 45 % say they lack confidence in him when it comes to world affairs, compared with a median of 29 % who say they trust him to do the right thing. But opinions vary widely across regions. In the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, half or more in almost all countries say they have no confidence in Xi Jinping when it comes to world affairs. Just 29 % have confidence in him to do what is right, which falls far short of the ratings for Japan ’s Shinzo or India ’s Narendr
The disparity is most pronounced in New Zealand, where the top quartile of most active legislative tweeters produced 76 % of all legislative tweets.
In survey after survey, Israelis give the U.S. some of its highest favorability ratings, and that ’s true again this year, with 81 % saying they have a positive view of the U.S. Assessments of American presidents, however, have fluctuated. In 2003, President George W. Bush received very high ratings, but those declined a bit over the course of his presidency. Obama ’s confidence ratings varied from 49 % to 71 % in the Center ’s polling in Israel during his administration. Between 2014 and 2015, his ratings dipped substantially, reflecting tensions between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyah
About 2.5 million Latinos are registered to vote in Florida for the 2020 presidential election, making up a record 17 % of the state ’s total.
In July, 29 % said they were following news about the presidential campaign very closely. That increased to 40 % in September, following the conventions that nominated George W. Bush and John Kerry.
Republicans are no more likely to consider their vote as “ against ” the president than they were in early 2010 ( 46 % today, 42 % in February 2010 ). But Republicans typically vote at higher rates than Democrats in midterm elections. Democratic voters ’ lack of enthusiasm for Obama may complicate Democrats ’ turnout efforts.
Large majorities of Hispanics and the general public ( both 70 % ) say the new coronavirus poses a major threat to the U.S. economy. But on other questions, Latinos ’ concerns are more pronounced than those of the wider public. About two - thirds ( 65 % ) of Hispanic adults say the coronavirus outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole, compared with about half ( 47 % ) of the general public. More Hispanics than Americans overall say the outbreak is a major threat to their personal financial situation ( 50 % vs. 34 % ), day - to
While blacks are more likely than whites to be Protestant or Muslim, they are significantly less likely to be Catholic. Only 5 % of blacks say they are Catholic, compared with 21 % of the public overall, including 19 % of whites, 48 % of Hispanics and 17 % of Asian Americans.
Large majorities of Americans say all eight of the issues included on the survey are at least a somewhat serious problem for the U.S. And seven of these issues are considered a serious problem by roughly eight - in - ten or more of those polled. All three economic issues are rated as very serious problems by roughly half or more of the American public. Two - in - three say the large amount of U.S. debt held by China ( $ 1.27 trillion ) is a very serious problem, and six - in - ten hold this view about the loss of jobs to China. Concerns about job losses are especially common among olde
The two biggest groups of the unemployed are people who ’ve lost their jobs permanently ( as opposed to those who are temporarily laid off or furloughed but expect to be recalled ), and people who ’ve resumed their job search and thus are once again considered part of the labor force. Last month, according to BLS, 2.8 million Americans who re - entered the labor force but had n’t yet found jobs were counted as unemployed. Those “ re - entrants, ” as the BLS calls them, made up 31.6 % of the total unemployed population – the highest level since befor
A majority of Americans ( 54 % ) say that gun ownership in this country does more to protect people from becoming victims of crime, while 40 % say it does more to put people ’s safety at risk.
About a quarter of the public ( 24 % ) say they very closely followed news about the deadly suicide bomb in Afghanistan on Dec. 30 that killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer ; 6 % say this was the story they followed most closely last week. The incident accounted for 3 % of coverage, according to PEJ. And with the announcement that several prominent lawmakers would not seek reelection this year, stories about the midterm elections made up 8 % of coverage. Two - in - ten Americans say they followed news about the 2010 elections very closely. Just 2 % say they followed these stories more closely than any other major news.
French Muslims split relatively evenly ( 42 % vs. 46 % ) on the issue. Not only is this remarkably different from Muslims elsewhere in Europe ( fully 81 % of British Muslims self - identify with their religion rather than their nationality, for example ) but it is remarkably close to the responses given by Americans when asked whether they identify first as national citizens or as Christians ( 48 % vs. 42 % ). Perhaps in this, as in other things, Muslims living in France are indeed absorbing the secular ways of their countrymen, among whom fully 83 % self - identify with their nationality, rather than their religion.
About two - in - ten ( 21 % ) say they followed the story very closely and just 3 % name news about CIA interrogation methods as their top story of the week.
President Donald Trump ’s prolific Twitter output has become source material for news outlets covering him – and during the early days of his administration, stories that included his tweets stood out from those that did not. They were more likely to have a negative assessment of the administration ’s words and actions and to include a challenge by the journalist to something Trump or a member of his administration said, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of more than 3,000 stories across 24 media outlets. A recent report from the Center found that about one - in - six news stories about the president or the administration ( 16 % ) during the first 100 day
In 2018, the birth rate for Hispanic and black teens ages 15 to 19 was almost double the rate among white teens and more than five times as high as the rate among Asians and Pacific Islanders.
The pattern of religious identity is another fundamental difference between the generations. Older generations identify overwhelmingly as Christian. For example, 85 % of the Silent generation identify as a member of a Christian denomination, while just 11 % say they are religiously unaffiliated ( defined as atheist, agnostic or “ nothing in particular ” ). By contrast, smaller majorities of Millennials ( 56 % ) and Gen Xers ( 70 % ) identify as Christian, while as many as 35 % of Millennials and 23 % of Gen Xers do not identify with any organized religion. Over the past seven years, the share of the U.S. population that doe
Slightly more than a quarter ( 27 % ) say they heard a lot last week about CBS correspondent Lara Logan being attacked while covering events in Egypt. Another 42 % say they heard a little about this, while 31 % say they heard nothing at all.
The energy issues and other topics.
India ’s population is expected to increase by 400 million by 2050. Its projected population of 1.6 billion will be almost equal to the populations of the U.S. and China combined. China is projected to add only 25 million residents.
Obama ’s Standing – Historically, second term presidencies are often full of surprises and many of them unpleasant. Absent a surprise, so far, public opinion on Obama is running ahead of George W. Bush, but behind where both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, whose unexpected troubles revealed themselves two years into their second term.
A median of 78 % in the eight countries surveyed say a lack of jobs is a very big problem in their country. And a median of 71 % cite the public debt.
About half ( 51 % ) declare any religious affiliation at all, versus close to eight - in - ten U.S. adults ; about a fifth ( 17 % ) are both religiously affiliated and say religion is very important in their lives, compared with just over half ( 54 % ) of the general public.
Republicans largely disapprove of the law across levels of educational attainment, but views of the government ’s role in ensuring health care coverage varies widely by education. Republicans and Republican leaners with no more than a high school diploma are nearly twice as likely as those with a college degree to say ensuring health care coverage is a government responsibility ( 43 % vs. 22 % ).
Among those who say they have discussed these topics with their children, 70 % say they raised the issues while only 10 % say their children initiated the conversations.
The U.S. Census Bureau data show that 144,000 more people left the island for the mainland than the other way around from mid-2010 to 2013, a larger gap between emigrants and migrants than during the entire decades of the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.
A string of revelations over the past two years about the National Security Agency ’s domestic and international surveillance efforts have brought new awareness to many Americans about online privacy and security concerns. Yet most American adults have not made significant changes to their digital behavior, and 54 % say that it would be “ somewhat ” or “ very ” difficult to find the tools and strategies that would enhance their privacy online and when using cellphones, according to a Pew Research Center report.
In December, a majority of the public ( 82 % ) also said Trump should be more cautious in “ the kinds of things he says and tweets ” once he becomes president. Just 15 % said there is no need for him to change.
Disabled Americans were politically engaged in the 2016 presidential election. In a survey conducted in the early summer of 2016, about seven - in - ten ( 71 % ) Americans who self - identified as disabled said it “ really matters who wins the election, ” compared with 59 % of Americans who did not report having a disability. Disabled Americans were also more likely to follow the campaign closely than those without a disability. These findings are from the Center ’s American Trends Panel, which found that 22 % of American adults self - reported living with a disability in 2016, defined as a “ health problem, disability, or handica
Rental rates have also risen notably among those ages 35 to 44. In 2016, about four - in - ten ( 41 % ) households headed by someone in this age range were renting, up from 31 % in 2006.
Opinions about the national economy have changed even more dramatically over this one - year period. Two - thirds now say Brazil ’s once - booming economy is in bad shape, while just 32 % say the economy is good. In 2013, the balance of opinion was reversed : a 59%-majority thought the country was in good shape economically, while 41 % said the economy was bad. Economic ratings had been consistently positive since 2010, when Pew Research first conducted a nationally - representative survey of Brazil.
Majorities of Americans say the federal government does not provide enough help for older people ( 65 % ), poor people ( 62 % ) and the middle class ( 61 % ). By contrast, nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) say the government provides too much help for wealthy people.
For adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self - identify as Hispanic, 81 % say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino. The reasons for this are many and are often linked to mixed backgrounds, limited contact with Hispanic relatives and few Hispanic cultural links, according to a follow - up open - ended question. For example, some 27 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic because they have a mixed Hispanic and non - Hispanic background or that their Hispanic ancestry is too distant. Another 16 % said they do not consider themselves Hispanic despite their Hispanic ancestry because of their upbringing or that they have little contact with their Hispanic relatives ; 15 % said th
Parents are more likely to be Facebook friends with their parents than non - parents, 53 % vs. 40 %. They also are more likely to be friends with their neighbors on the network, 41 % vs. 34 % of non - parents.
Republicans in the new, 114th Congress identify as Catholic than in any other recent Congress, and they now outnumber Catholic Democrats in the House, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis.
In 2004, 27 of the 41 candidates who appeared in the Republican or Democratic presidential primary debates ( or have announced for 2016 ) included a public address in their formal announcement, according to our calculations. ( Sometimes, candidates have also made the announcement on some other platform, as in 2003 when former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, announced on The Daily Show before giving a formal speech. ) In that election cycle, twice as many Republican candidates ( eight ) made their announcements through a TV or radio appearance than did through formal speeches ( four ). And this was not simply “ dark horse ” candidates looking for a gimmick
Most U.S adult Twitter users do n’t tweet very often. A large majority of tweets come from a small minority of users. The median Twitter user produces two tweets per month, according to a 2019 study. However, among the most prolific tweeters – defined as those in the top 10 % of tweeters – the median user produces 138 tweets each month. And that group of highly prolific tweeters dominates discourse on the platform more broadly : 80 % of all tweets from American adults come from the top 10 % of tweeters.
A median of 60 % say they expect their country ’s economy to improve over the next 12 months, the highest of any region. A median of 56 % believe children in their country today will be financially better off than their parents, and about seven - in - ten or more hold this view in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.
In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, roughly three - quarters of adults said it was OK for people to use their phones while walking down the street, riding public transit or waiting in line, but far fewer found it acceptable to use cellphones during a meeting, at the movies or in church.
Fully 64 % of Democratic and Democratic - leaning registered voters say Trump would make a terrible president. That is by far the highest percentage among the seven GOP candidates in the survey.
A new Pew Research Center report on parents of 13- to 17 - year - olds finds that parents take a wide range of actions to monitor their teen ’s digital life and to encourage their child to use technology in an appropriate and responsible manner. Parents are keeping a close eye on their teen ’s digital life, but few do so by tech - based means. Roughly six - in - ten parents say they have either checked which websites their teen has visited or looked at their teen ’s social media profile. And about half say they have looked through their teen ’s phone call records or messages. But few parent
About half ( 48 % ) believed China would never surpass the U.S. as the world ’s leading superpower, while 46 % said that China would eventually replace the U.S. or already had. By contrast, in 2009, a majority ( 57 % ) of Americans thought China would never overtake the U.S. as the top global power.
Non - internet users as a group are disproportionately old and poor. The median age of non - internet users is 59, and 25 % report having household incomes under $ 20,000 per year. It is not, however, simply a question of money or age. Non - internet users do not have very positive attitudes about information technology. Many report worries about information overload and few link information technology to greater control over their lives. Moreover, non - internet users are apt to see the online environment as a dangerous place – that is, a place with inappropriate or irrelevant content.
In which country is the percentage of mobile payment use the highest in Africa?While making or receiving payments is one of the least common cell phone activities, it is much more common in the region where mobile money is a phenomenon – Africa, and more specifically, Kenya and its neighbor Uganda. Nearly seven - in - ten Kenyans ( 68 % ) who own a cell phone say they regularly use their mobile device to make or receive payments. Half in Uganda say this as well. Meanwhile, even though only 29 % of mobile owners in South Africa and 24 % in Senegal say they use their phones for monetary transactions, these are still among th
A decade ago, the balance of opinion was reversed : 55 % were opposed, while 35 % were in favor.
The successful capture last week of Mosul, Iraq ’s second largest city, by the extremist organization Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) – and the group ’s continued push toward the Iraqi capital, Baghdad – seemed to confirm widespread fears in the Middle East that violence in Syria would spill over into neighboring states. Middle East worries about spreading violence and a possible triumph by extremists in Syria have been evident in Pew Research surveys the past two years. A 2013 poll found that roughly three - quarters or more of the public in Lebanon, Tunisia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian territories were concerned that the ongoing Syrian conflict would destabi
Latinos continue to lag behind non - Latinos in cell phone use. Just over three - fourths ( 76 % ) of Latinos ages 18 and older use cell phones ; this number is 86 % among non - Latinos.9 The same is true with regard to internet use, despite marked gains by Latinos in recent years ( Livingston, Parker and Fox 2009 ). Some 64 % of Latinos use the internet, compared with 78 % of non - Latinos — a 14 percentage point difference.
The median age of Web - using adults who got news from The Daily Show was 36 years last year, similar to that of its then - companion show, The Colbert Report ( 33 years ).
About four - in - five of the nation ’s estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants are of Hispanic origin ( Passel and Cohn, 2010 ). A new national survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center, finds that Latinos are divided over what to do with these immigrants. A small majority ( 53 % ) says they should pay a fine but not be deported. A small minority ( 13 % ) says they should be deported, and a larger minority ( 28 % ) says they should not be punished.
The partisan gap on the overall favorability measure. More than six - in - ten Republicans ( 63 % ) give China an unfavorable rating, compared with 51 % of independents and 50 % of Democrats. Negative assessments of China are also more common among older Americans. Fully 64 % of those ages 50 and older have a negative opinion, while just 39 % hold this view among people under age 30.
Greeks also differ from other Europeans in their evaluation of international institutions. Roughly two - thirds of Europeans have a favorable view of the United Nations, the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ).

( Even though the 2018 and 2020 surveys produced different estimates of the share of Catholics who view Pope Francis favorably, the differences between the current survey and each of the surveys conducted in 2018 do not pass a test of statistical significance. ) A January 2018 survey found growing partisan polarization in views of Pope Francis, with Catholic Republicans holding less favorable views of the pontiff than Catholic Democrats. That polarization persists toda

Differences in race and ethnicity account for some of these disparities, since urban areas have a larger share of black residents, who are typically less likely to be married than other racial groups. Even so, the marriage gap across community types remains when looking only at whites : 49 % of urban whites are married, compared with 53 % of suburban whites and 54 % of rural whites. And among blacks, those living in suburban areas are somewhat more likely to be married ( 32 % ) than those living in rural ( 27 % ) or urban ( 26 % ) areas.

Back in 2000, somewhat fewer college - educated Gen X women ( 70 % ) had been on the job that long. Among college - educated Gen X men, 72 % had similar tenure. The increasing job tenure of college - educated Millennials is consistent with a decline in employer switching among all working - age adults since the 1980s. The reasons for the decline are not well understood. Recent research indicates that the rise of dual - career households, the declin
Sixty - four percent of Pakistanis have a favorable opinion of the Prime Minister, unchanged from the 66 % who expressed this view in a survey conducted weeks before his election victory last year. About a third ( 32 % ) give Sharif an unfavorable rating.
The Iraq policy debate in Washington also captured substantial public attention while finishing first ( 17 % ) in terms of news coverage.

In 2018, among workers ages 25 to 34, women ’s earnings were 89 % those of men, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly wages that includes full- and part - time workers.

About two - thirds of the global Somali diaspora live in neighboring countries. At nearly half a million, Kenya hosts the largest number of Somali migrants ( both refugees and nonrefugees ) of any other country, according to UN estimates. Not far behind is Ethiopia with 440,000 Somali migrants. Combining Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Yemen ( across the Gulf of Aden ), nearly two - thirds of the world ’s Somali migrants lived in neighboring countries in 2015. At the same time, Somalis have become increasingly dispersed across the world. In 1990, an estimated 90 % of Somali migrants lived in th
Roughly two - thirds ( 66 % ) of Americans say scientists will probably or definitely cure most forms of cancer within 50 years. Roughly half of adults ( 54 % ) think the idea of implanted computer chips is likely to be a routine occurrence in the future. Some 48 % say humans will definitely or probably use implanted sensors to monitor or adjust all food and medications that enter the bloodstream by the year 2066. And a similar share of adults, 47 %, foresees a future with almost no birth defects because of genetic modification of embryos prior to birth.
Muslims around the world are set to mark Ramadan, a holy month when many fast from sunrise to sunset in order to focus on their spiritual life and get closer to God. In the United States, the vast majority of Muslims celebrate Ramadan, with eight - in - ten saying they fast during the holiday. Fasting for Ramadan is common across all the demographic groups that make up America ’s 2.15 million Muslim adults. For instance, similar shares of Muslim men and women ( 77 % vs. 82 % ) say they fast, and there is little difference between Muslims who were born in the U.S. and immigrants ( 79
57 % say it is unacceptable for the government to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens. At the same time, majorities support monitoring of those particular individuals who use words like “ explosives ” and “ automatic weapons ” in their search engine queries ( 65 % say that ) and those who visit anti - American websites ( 67 % say that ).
In 2010, households in the U.S. were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries examined in this report. The U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six - in - ten adults were in the middle class. Meanwhile, compared with those in many Western European countries, greater shares of Americans were either lower income ( 26 % ) or upper income ( 15 % ). The middle class is a significant presence in the Western European countries analyzed, even as it is shrinking in many countries. Middle - class shares ranged from 64 % in Spain to 80 % in Denmark and Norway in 2010. The share o
Dramatic events in London and Scotland last week attracted a large news audience. Roughly a third of the public paid very close attention to news that British police had found and defused two car bombs in London, and another 31 % followed the story fairly closely. Fully 21 % said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other — making it the most closely followed news story of the week.
Overall, 62 % of women and 54 % of men say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton. But these differences are particularly evident among whites : 61 % of white Democratic women say there is a good chance they would vote for Clinton compared with 43 % of white Democratic men. Conversely, more white Democratic men ( 45 % ) than women ( 26 % ) see some chance of voting for Clinton. Only about 10 % in each group sees no chance of voting for her.
About a quarter and a third of refugees entering each year were adherents of other religions, including several thousand Hindus ( mostly from Bhutan ) and Buddhists ( mostly from Burma and Bhutan ). Refugees with no religious affiliation were 5 % of all refugees admitted to the U.S. in fiscal 2002. Since then, the share of refugees with no religious affiliation has decreased, amounting to less than 1 % of refugees entering the U.S. during fiscal 2017.
The new data show that 4.32 million adults ( ages 18 or older ) were newlywed in 2012, a 3 % increase over the 4.21 million adults newly married in 2011. ( The data do not include same - sex couples. ) But a closer look at the demographic patterns reveals some interesting insights about who is getting married. From 2011 to 2012, the total number of newly married adults increased by 113,000 ( from 4.21 million to 4.32 million ). Examining the newlyweds by education level, the number of newly married adults with at least a bachelor ’s degree increased by 98,00

About seven - in - ten Republicans ( 71 % ) approve of the tax law, including 43 % who strongly approve.
About four - in - ten ( 42 % ) say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy more closely than any other news. That is three times the number saying their top story was news about the candidates for the 2012 presidential election ( 14 % ), according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Aug. 18 - 21 among 1,007 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press.

About six - in - ten women ( 57 % ) hold this view, compared with 42 % of men. But there are sharp differences by political affiliation and – among Democrats – education. About three - quarters ( 74 % ) of women who are Democrats or Democratic - leaning independents say the country has n’t gone far enough on gender equality, compared with just a third ( 33 % ) of women who are Republican or Republican leaners.

The percentage of Latinos in the U.S. who are Catholic is declining, according to a major new Pew Research Center report. A majority ( 55 % ) of the nation ’s estimated 35.4 million Latino adults – or about 19.6 million Latinos – identify as Catholic, but that ’s down from two - thirds ( 67 % ) as recently as 2010. Today, nearly one - in - four Latino adults ( 24 % ) are now former Catholics.

The FBI reported a total of 2,109.9 property crimes per 100,000 people, compared with 379.4 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Both the FBI and BJS data show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s, when crime spiked across much of the nation. Using the BJS statistics, the declines in the violent and property crime rates are even steeper than those reported by the FBI.

Asians make up 43 % of immigrant eligible voters in California, the highest of any racial or ethnic group.
India lags behind other emerging nations in internet access and smartphone ownership. Across the 21 emerging and developing nations surveyed in 2015 ( including India ), a median of 54 % have internet access and 37 % own smartphones. In India, however, only 22 % have internet access and only 17 % have a smartphone. Like most of the 40 countries surveyed in 2015, there are big demographic differences in internet access. Younger, more - educated and higher - income Indians are more likely to use the web than older, less - educated and lower - income Indians ( relative to the median household income within India ). Men are also more likely to have acces
Overall, views of extremist groups are negative across the Muslim publics surveyed. A median of about a third or fewer have a positive view of al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hamas, or Hezbollah. And in no country polled do any of these organizations receive majority Muslim support. Al Qaeda, which is responsible for some of the most well - known and devastating terrorist attacks in the last 15 years, receives the most negative ratings among the extremist groups included in the survey. A median of 57 % across the 11 Muslim publics surveyed hold an unfavorable view of the group. This includes strong majorities of Muslims in Lebanon ( 96 % ), Jordan ( 8
Suburban counties not only had the most overall drug overdose deaths in 2016, they also had the highest age - adjusted rate of deadly overdoses – a metric that controls for differences in population size and average age across the three community types. The age - adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in suburban counties was 21.1 per 100,000 people in 2016, compared with 18.7 per 100,000 in rural counties and 18.5 per 100,000 in urban counties.
About six - in - ten Americans ( 61 % ) expect that Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual, while just 29 % say they expect the parties to work together more. Majorities have expected the parties to bicker and oppose rather than work together in recent years, though public predictions for partisan cooperation were substantially higher on the eve of Barack Obama ’s inauguration eight years ago.
In the U.S., both Republicans and Democrats name the UK as their most trusted partner, although Democrats are more likely to say this. Republicans are also more likely to name Israel as the preeminent partner than are Democrats. But equal shares from both parties see Germany as a top partner, and the same can be said of China.
In 2016, 21 % of Americans identified as Democrats or Democratic leaners and also as liberal. While that is only somewhat higher than a year earlier ( 19 % ), it is the highest share dating back to 2000. At that time, just 12 % of the public described themselves as both liberal and as Democrats or Democratic leaners. There has been little change since 2000 in other partisan and ideological categories, although the share saying they do not lean to either party is smaller today ( 11 % ) than in the early 2000s ( 17 % in 2000 ).
Today, only 19 % in Turkey like the U.S., while nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) share a dislike of their NATO ally.
In this year ’s Pew survey, majorities in seven of eight predominantly Muslims nations believe the U.S. may someday threaten their country — including 71 % in Turkey and 58 % in Lebanon. And Muslims are increasingly hostile to Americans as well as America ; in the past, as the 1983 Newsweek survey showed, people did not let their distaste for U.S. policies affect their view of the American people. In addition, an overwhelming percentage in most Muslim nations – and as many as half or more in countries like Brazil and South Korea – said they were disappointed that the Iraqi military put up so little resistance in the war against th
Obama ’s job approval measure has fallen eight points since December, from 55 % to 47 %. His rating is comparable to George W. Bush ’s ( 45 % ) at the same point early in his second term and is much lower than Bill Clinton ’s 60 % rating in February 1997.
The trend among Americans towards data-checking organizations are increasingly being tapped to fight against misinformation, Republicans appear to have serious concerns about the fairness of these groups. Democrats, on the other hand, mostly think they are fair to all sides. Overall, Americans are split in their views of fact - checkers : Half say fact - checking efforts by news outlets and other organizations tend to deal fairly with all sides, while about the same portion ( 48 % ) say they tend to favor one side, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 19 to March 4, 2019. But members of the two parties do not see eye - to
Richer countries, as measured by gross domestic product per capita ( purchasing power parity ), tend to have higher rates of internet use, while poorer countries tend to have lower rates. This pattern has been consistent across prior surveys and remains today for both internet use and smartphone ownership. The pattern of smartphone ownership is similar to internet use, with people in wealthier countries exhibiting higher rates of ownership. But the gap in smartphone ownership is narrower than in the past, as many move directly from not owning a phone at all to owning a mobile device. Landline phones are simply being skipped by large numbers of people in emerging and developing markets.
About seven - in - ten Americans ( 69 % ) say there ’s solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March. That ’s about as many as said so in 2008, although acceptance of the reality of global warming has risen and fallen considerably over that time span : from a high of 79 % in July 2006 to a low of 57 % in October 2009. But opinions vary on what ’s causing the planet ’s mean temperature to rise. Four in ten ( 42 % ) said it was primarily due to huma

The growth of the Latino vote continued to lag well behind the growth of the Latino population. This widening gap is driven by two key demographic trends : a high percentage of the new Hispanics in the population are either too young to vote or ineligible because they are not citizens ( Figure 1 ).
Even at various points when Obama was in office, majorities of Democrats viewed the U.S. as less respected internationally ; 58 % said this last year. But now, 87 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the U.S. is less respected than in the past, with 70 % saying this is a major problem.

A global median of 70 % say China plays a more important role in the world than it did 10 years ago. Russia is a distant second in this assessment, with only 42 % saying that country is more important than it was a decade ago. A median of only 31 % believe the U.S. plays a more important role than it did a decade ago – less than half of the share who say this of China. Only 8 % of those surveyed say China plays a less important role than it did a decade ago, the lowest share across the seven countries tested. In the U.S., 72 % believe China is more importan
Overall, the Japanese public is decidedly pessimistic about how things are going in their country. Fully 78 % express dissatisfaction with the country ’s direction, while an overwhelming 93 % describe the current state of the economy as bad. Compared with last year, fewer expect the economic situation to worsen, but the prevailing view is that the economy will stagnate, rather than improve in the months ahead.
The news is not all bad, however. The trend in falling voter turnout among young people was reversed in 2004. Among the voting age members of the DotNet cohort ( ages 18 - 29 ), 49 % voted, an increase of 9 percentage points from 2000. While young people still lag behind older adults, the rise in voter turnout among those ages 30 and older was a much more modest 3 percentage points – from 65 % to 68 %.
The U.S. unemployment rate has skyrocketed, and the International Monetary Fund predicts the U.S. gross domestic product will shrink in 2020, while the Chinese economy will achieve positive growth. The American public ’s economic confidence has also declined.
The sense that increasing presidential power would be “ too risky ” has grown among Democrats since August, when Barack Obama was still president : While a 66 % majority said giving presidents greater powers would be too risky in August, nearly nine - in - ten ( 87 % ) now say this. Conversely, while 82 % of Republicans expressed concern about increasing presidential powers relative to the other branches of government in August, a smaller majority ( 65 % ) say this today.
The trend line slopes up more steeply in 2004 and 2005 than in 2006. Figure 4 is based on regression analyses of quarterly averages.1 It shows a broad trend of increasing growth from the last quarter of 2004 through the second quarter of 2006 and a flattening of the growth rate since then.
Black Democrats also are more likely than other Democrats to say morality is linked to a belief in God. A 55 % majority of black Democrats say “ it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral, ” while 44 % say it is not necessary.

Pew Research Center, in collaboration with Abt SRBI, appended two different activity flags ( Cell - WINS and Targus ) in a large ( n=10,013 ) national dual frame RDD survey in 2014. Half of the interviews in that study were conducted on cellphones and half on landlines. With the Cell - WINS flag, 15 % of flagged - inactive cellphone numbers were found to be working and residential ( false negatives ), and one - in - ten flagged - active numbers were found to be non - working or non - residential ( false positives ). With the Targus flag, both error rate

The generation of Central and Eastern Europeans who came of age after the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union differs little in its political outlook from earlier generations weaned on communist ideology and anti - Western propaganda. Today, support for democracy is relatively tepid among both age groups. Majorities in most countries across the region are upbeat about free markets, with similar levels of support among young and old, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of adults in 18 Central and Eastern European countries.

The agency ’s data finds the dividing line is age 55 : labor force participation is expected to fall for those under that age who are considered the prime workforce group, and to rise for those above that age. There is less of an increase projected for 55 - to-64 year olds. In 2002, 61.9 % of Americans in this age group were in the workforce, a number that increased to 64.5 % in 2012. The 2022 projection is that 67.5 % will remain in the workforce.

Three - in - ten Americans paid very close attention to news about the presidential campaign last week, however, only 11 % listed the campaign as the single news story they were following more closely than any other — putting it in fourth place behind the economy, the troubles facing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the situation in Iraq. Fully 45 % of the public followed news about the economy very closely and 29 % listed this as their most closely followed story. News of the financial crisis facing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an
About three - quarters of Muslim Americans ( 74 % ) say President Donald Trump is unfriendly toward them, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. And they are no fans of Trump ’s : Just 19 % say they approve of the job Trump is doing as president, and among Muslims who reported voting last November, only 8 % say they cast their ballots for him. Most Muslim Americans ( 64 % ) also say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. – a sharp rise since the Center ’s last comprehensive survey of U.S. Muslims in 2011, when just 38 % too
About seven - in - ten Americans ( 72 % ) say that changing an unborn baby ’s genetic characteristics to treat a serious disease or condition that the baby would have at birth is an appropriate use of medical technology, while 27 % say this would be taking technology too far. A somewhat smaller share of Americans say gene editing to reduce a baby ’s risk of developing a serious disease or condition over their lifetime is appropriate ( 60 % say this, while 38 % say it would be taking medical technology too far ). But just 19 % of Americans say it would be appropriate to use gene editing to make a baby more intelligent ; eigh
The new survey also finds continued majority support for legal abortion : 53 % of Americans say that abortion should be legal in all ( 23 % ) or most cases ( 31 % ) ; 39 % say that abortion should be illegal in all ( 16 % ) or most cases ( 23 % ).
Mexico ’s military continues to be highly rated, with about six - in - ten ( 61 % ) saying the military has a positive impact on the way things are going in the country. While the military receives the highest ratings of the groups and institutions tested, views of the military have turned less positive since last year, when 75 % said it was having a positive impact. Today the military ’s ratings are similar to what they were in 2011 ( 62 % ), the peak year of drug - related homicides in Mexico. Trends in the views of police influence follow a similar pattern.
About six - in - ten black Democrats ( 57 % ) say that Trump ’s economic policies have made economic conditions in the country worse. Smaller shares of white ( 47 % ) and Hispanic ( 43 % ) Democrats say the same.
Overall, 69 % of voters who are closely following reports about corruption say most members should not be reelected in 2006, far more antagonism than among people who are less engaged in the story. And among independents, these feelings are even stronger. Fully 77 % of independent voters who are closely tracking this news story believe most members should be voted out this fall.
A substantial majority ( 69 % ) also says they already mostly know what they need to know about Mitt Romney. Only about a quarter ( 28 % ) say they need to learn more to get a clear impression of Romney.
The large drop in new arrivals is almost entirely due to a drop in the number of Mexican unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S. in the previous five years, compared with 52 % in 2007. This represents a decrease in the average annual inflow of Mexican unauthorized immigrants, from about 375,000 per year in 2002 - 2007 to about 90,000 per year for 2012 - 2017.
Americans continue to express frustration with the federal government, rather than anger or contentment. A majority of Americans say frustration ( 55 % ) best describes their feeling toward the federal government, while about two - in - ten say they are angry ( 22 % ) ; a similar share ( 19 % ) say they are basically content. Overall, attitudes toward the federal government today are virtually identical to a year ago. In March 2016, 57 % said they felt frustrated with the federal government, while 21 % said they were angry and 20 % said they were basically content.
Democrats have become more uniformly critical of business and more supportive of government.

Americans across the political spectrum expressed rising worry about North Korea ’s nuclear program following a series of increasingly advanced missile tests by the secretive Asian nation and an escalating war of words between Trump and the country ’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Three - quarters of Americans said in October that they view North Korea ’s nuclear program as a “ major threat ” to the U.S., up from 64 % in January and as high a share as at any point since 2005. Majorities in both parties said the U.S. should take the North ’s threats very seriously ; that the North is really willin
In Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn won 57 % of the Latino vote to Republican David Perdue ’s 42 %. But Perdue won the election. In Texas, the Latino vote was split between incumbent Republican John Cornyn ( 48 % ) and Democrat David Alameel ( 47 % ), as Cornyn won support from nearly half of Latinos.

Over the course of the nation ’s history, there has been a slow but steady decrease in the size of the average U.S. household – from 5.79 people per household in 1790 to 2.58 in 2010. But this decade will likely be the first since the one that began in 1850 to break this long - running trend, according to newly released Census Bureau data. In 2018 there were 2.63 people per household.
Democrats with a high level of knowledge about climate change.
In raw numbers, Turkey hosted more refugees than any other country last year : almost 1.6 million ( or about 2 % of the country ’s population ), including more than 1.5 million refugees from Syria and about 25,000 from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. ( The total number of refugees in Turkey has since grown to 2 million, but they ’re not allowed to seek permanent asylum there. Some experts say Turkey ’s policy contributes to the surge of refugees into European Union countries with more liberal asylum standards. ) Other nations adjoining conflict zones with significant refugee populations relative to their populations are Chad ( 4 %
By contrast, smaller shares of Americans who live in urban areas ( 13 % ) or the suburbs ( 9 % ) view access to high - speed internet service as a major problem in their area. And a majority of both urban and suburban residents report that this is not an issue in their local community, according to the survey, conducted Feb. 26 - March 11. ( The survey categorized Americans as urban, suburban or rural based on their own description of their community type. )
The unemployment rates for these groups increased by similar amounts from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008. However, the number of unemployed persons increased at a much faster rate for foreign - born Hispanics. The U.S. economy employed 2 million fewer persons in the fourth quarter of 2008 than it employed in the fourth quarter of 2007. Among major racial and ethnic groups, only native - born Hispanics added jobs in the past year. But this was principally a function of demographics. The native - born Latino labor force is increasing more rapidly than the labor force for any other group—4.8 % compared with only 0.7
40 % of whites say race relations are generally good, compared with 28 % of blacks and 33 % of Hispanics who say this.
The Gallup Organization has tracked voter preferences in House races for more than half a century, and its final midterm election polls have consistently paralleled actual election results. Indeed, on average, the final Gallup Poll has been within 1.1 % of the actual vote. Similarly, surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press ( as well as its predecessor, the Times Mirror Center for the People & amp ; the Press ) have consistently shown that the generic ballot closely tracks election results.
The most active 10 % of adult Twitter users in the U.S. produce 80 % of all tweets sent by these users. The median adult user of the platform tweets just twice a month, but a small group tweets much more frequently, according to our April study. There was an even starker pattern in a follow - up study that looked specifically at tweets about national politics. In that study, 97 % of tweets that were created by U.S. adults and mentioned national politics came from just 10 % of users.
Across the Middle East and North Africa, ISIS is seen as the leading threat in all four countries in which the item was tested. This sentiment is nearly universal in Lebanon, with 97 % saying ISIS poses a major threat to their country. Large majorities in Tunisia ( 79 % ), Jordan ( 76 % ) and Israel ( 63 % ) agree. Israel stands out among the Middle Eastern countries surveyed for its lower levels of concern about each international threat tested. While 63 % of Israelis see ISIS as a major threat, about four - in - ten or fewer name any other issue as a major challenge. Within Israel, Jews are more concerned than Arab
The state of the U.S. economy and the health care debate in Washington shared the position of American ’s top story last week. One - in - five named either the economy ( 21 % ) or health care ( 21 % ) as the news they followed more closely than any other. These two stories also received comparable levels of new coverage according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism : 13 % of total news was devoted to the economy and 11 % to the debate on reforming health care.
The death penalty has declined across most groups, a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 23 - Sept. 2 among 1,201 adults finds that most Republicans continue to largely favor its use in cases of murder, while most Democrats oppose it. By more than two - to - one, more Republicans ( 72 % ) than Democrats ( 34 % ) currently favor the death penalty.
Pairing a survey with an examination of the Twitter behaviors of U.S. adults also allows for a comparison of the attitudes and characteristics of political tweeters with those of other Twitter users. Political tweeters – defined as those who tweeted at least five times in total, and at least twice about national politics, over the year of the study period – are almost twice as likely as other Twitter users to say the people they follow on Twitter have political beliefs similar to their own ( 38 % of political tweeters say this, compared with around one - in - five among nonpolitical tweeters ). By contrast, nonpolitical tweeters ar
Respondents were asked whether they thought a series of online platforms were more welcoming toward men, more welcoming toward women, or equally welcoming to both sexes. While most online environments were viewed as equally welcoming to both genders, the starkest results were for online gaming. Some 44 % of respondents felt the platform was more welcoming toward men. Data in this report are drawn from the Pew Research Center ’s American Trends Panel, a probability - based, nationally representative panel. This survey was conducted May 30 – June 30, 2014 and self - administered via the internet by 2,849 web users, with a margin of error of plus o
Overall satisfaction with the choice of candidates is at its lowest point in two decades.
The public divided its attention among the top stories last week, though Americans say they followed news about the economy – and the fate of General Motors – most closely. Two - in - ten say they followed news about the condition of the U.S. economy most closely among the leading stories. More than four - in - ten ( 43 % ) say they followed economic news very closely, comparable to the share following the economy very closely in recent weeks.

No more than about a third of Republicans say any of these groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House ( 33 % gays and lesbians, 32 % Hispanics ).
A large majority of Americans ( 78 % ) feel a strong sense of gratitude or thankfulness on a weekly basis, according to a new poll by the Pew Research Center. And only 6 % of Americans say they seldom or never experience these feelings.

Currently, 49 % of Americans say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns, while 46 % say it is more important to control gun ownership. In September 2010, 50 % prioritized gun control, 46 % gun rights. In this regard, there is no sign that the longer trend toward an emphasis on gun owners ’ rights has abated.
In 2017, just 36 % of Republicans and Republican leaners said colleges and universities have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, an 18 - percentage - point decline from two years prior. By contrast, 72 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners said colleges and universities have a positive effect, which was little changed from prior years.
The survey finds considerable evidence of the bitterness unleashed by the presidential campaign. Dating back to 1988, no candidate, Democrat or Republican, has been viewed as more critical of their opponent than is Trump today ( the question was not asked in 1992 ). Currently, 62 % of voters say Trump has been too personally critical of Clinton, which is about 10 percentage points higher than the previous peak ( 53 % said that about Bob Dole in 1996, 52 % for John Kerry in 2004 ). Just 36 % say he has not been too critical of Clinton. By comparison, 44 % say Clinton has been too personally critical of her opponent, which i
Lack of employment opportunities is seen by the public as India ’s biggest challenge, with 76 % of adults saying it is a very big problem – little changed over the past year. In 2018, despite an estimated 3.5 % formal unemployment rate, 18.6 million Indians were jobless and another 393.7 million work in poor - quality jobs vulnerable to displacement, according to estimates by the International Labor Office. Other aspects of the economy are also at the top of the public ’s concerns. More than seven - in - ten ( 73 % ) believe rising prices are a very big problem. About two - third
Non - Hispanic whites will remain the largest racial or ethnic group in the overall population but will become less than a majority, the projections show.

Among GOP voters, fully 75 % of those who support Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination say life for people like them has gotten worse, compared with 63 % of Ted Cruz supporters and 54
One - in - seven U.S. infants ( 14 % ) are multiracial or multiethnic. This share is nearly triple the share ( 5 % ) in 1980. Multiracial or multiethnic infants include children younger than 1 year old who live with two parents and whose parents are each of a different race, those with one Hispanic and one non - Hispanic parent, and those with at least one parent who identifies as multiracial.
The public increasingly views the federal budget deficit as a major problem the country must address now. But fewer predict the country will achieve significant progress in reducing the deficit in five years than did so in December. A new survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press and The Washington Post, conducted April 21 - 25 among 1,001 adults, finds that 31 % say we will have achieved significant progress on the deficit in the next five years or so, down from 37 % in December. Fully 81 % see the deficit as a major problem that must be addressed now – rather than one that can be addressed when the economy improve
In fall 2015, the share of nonwhite students in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools hit a record 51 %. That ’s up from 30 % in fall 1986. Growth has been especially fast among Hispanic students, who increased from 10 % of students in 1986 to 26 % in 2015. At the same time, nonwhites continue to make up a relatively small share of teachers : In the 2015 - 16 school year, just 20 % of public school elementary and secondary teachers were nonwhite, up from 13 % in 1987 - 88. (
In the survey, which was in the field as Obama appeared on the Sunday talk shows on Sept. 20, Americans continue to say they are highly interested in the health care debate : 36 % say it was the story they followed most closely last week, more than double the percentage for any other major story.

By 56 % to 15 %, Indians express a favorable, rather than unfavorable, view of the United States, with 28 % offering no opinion. Meanwhile, Indians are roughly divided in their attitude toward China ( 35 % favorable vs. 41 % unfavorable ). And, by a margin of 21 percentage points, they are more positively disposed toward the United States then they are toward China. By nearly four - to - one ( 47 % to 12 % ) Indians say the United States is today the world ’s leading economic power rather than China. However, a third of Indians say China has already replaced or will eventually replace the United States a
The Census Bureau ’s initial announcement was that members of minority groups — defined as anyone who is not non - Hispanic white — accounted for 50.4 % of the U.S. population younger than age 1 on July 1, 2011.

A Pew Research Center survey of 2,003 American adults ( including 795 who are currently employed on a full - or part - time basis ) conducted Sept. 11 - 14 and 18 - 21, 2014, finds that social media plays some role in the lives of many American workers – but that role is not always clear - cut or entirely positive. As noted above, 17 % of workers say they use social media to build or strengthen personal relationships at work – but the transparency that social media facilitates comes with costs as well as benefits. Some 14 % of workers have found information on social media that has improved their professional opinion of a colleague
The public ’s list of national concerns, with roughly one - in - three ( 34 % ) citing economic problems as the nation ’s most grave, compared with 27 % who say the war in Iraq is the biggest problem facing the nation. This represents a reversal from a year ago, when 42 % cited Iraq as the most important problem in the wake of Bush ’s proposal to increase the number of troops there. As recently as September, 37 % of Americans cited Iraq as the nation ’s biggest problem, nearly double the 20 % who cited economic problems. But current views are more in line with public opinion i
Overall, the public remains skeptical about the prospects of Cuba shifting in a democratic direction but more ( 43 % ) say they think the communist country will become more democratic over the next several years than did so in January ( 32 % ).

The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Dec. 8 - 13 among 1,500 adults, finds that since the start of this year, the share of Americans who say the government is doing well in reducing the threat of terrorism has fallen by 26 percentage points – from 72 % to 46 % – and now stands at its lowest point in the post-9/11 era. Approval of the way Barack Obama is handling the threat of terrorism also has declined, even as his overall job rating ( currently 46 % ) – and his ratings on immigration, the economy and other issues – is little changed. Just 37 % approve of th
Just 21 % of Americans say relations between Republicans and Democrats will get better in the coming year. Far more ( 37 % ) expect relations to worsen, while 41 % say they will stay about the same.
In some cases, partisan shifts in opinion were dramatic. Amid Trump ’s persistent criticisms of CNN and other media outlets as “ fake news, ” for example, partisan differences over the role of the press as a “ watchdog ” were wider than in more than three decades of Pew Research Center surveys. In a March survey, Democrats were roughly twice as likely as Republicans to say criticism from news organizations keeps political leaders from doing things that should n’t be done ( 89 % versus 42 % ). When the Center last asked this question in January and February 2016, about three - quarters of both Democrats ( 74

Views of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad are negative across all of the Middle Eastern and North African nations surveyed. Only 7 % in Israel and 1 % in Jordan view Assad positively. Syrians living in Jordan have similarly negative views of the Syrian president ; only 3 % have a favorable view of Assad.
A majority of U.S. adults ( 82 % ) say that there are times when it is acceptable for journalists to use anonymous sources, with 67 % saying it is acceptable only in special cases – a view which echoes the standards of professional journalism organizations that say journalists should take every step to attribute information to a named source when possible before relying on an anonymous source. A much smaller share – 15 % – thinks use of anonymous sources is always acceptable.
A median of 76 % among the European and North American publics agree. Nearly as many foreign policy experts describe Trump as “ dangerous. ” A median of roughly seven - in - ten across the publics surveyed share this view.
A majority of Americans ( 62 % ) say that when thinking about the fundamental design and structure of government, significant changes are needed to make it work for current times ; 37 % say the design and structure of government serves the country well and does not need significant changes. These overall opinions have changed little since 2018, but Republicans and Democrats have moved in opposing directions. In 2018, half of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents said significant changes to American government were needed ; today, that share has dropped to 41 %.
Currently about half of Republicans ( 49 % ) say they are satisfied with the state of the nation. Though this is unchanged since February, it is up from 24 % in January and 11 % in late October, a few weeks before the 2016 election. Throughout the course of Barack Obama ’s presidency, no more than about two - in - ten Republicans expressed satisfaction with the way things were going in the country. By contrast, Democrats ’ satisfaction with the country has plummeted following the election : Just 16 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are satisfied with the way things are going today.
Majorities in most of the nations polled are concerned about extremism. And in most Middle Eastern countries, concern about extremism has increased in the past year. In Lebanon, which shares a long border with conflict - ridden Syria, 92 % of the public is worried about Islamic extremism, up 11 points from the already high figure of 81 % in 2013. Lebanese Christians ( 95 % ), Shia Muslims ( 95 % ) and Sunni Muslims ( 86 % ) all share high levels of concern.

( 48 % ), and Sioux City, Iowa ( 53 % ) did not access the paper online. Indeed, print newspaper readers tend to be news enthusiasts. They are more likely to often watch local TV news than those newspaper readers who access the paper online instead of or in addition to the print edition. And although print - only readers in the three cities studied are certainly older than their counterparts who access the paper online – in thei
Approval ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders remain negative on balance and are lower than they were in February. Today, 29 % say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing, down from 37 % in February. Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are even worse : just 22 % say they approve of the job they are doing. Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are down from a recent high point of 34 %, reached in February at the start of the 115th Congress. The recent drop in ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders is largely attributable to partisans ’ increasingly negative assessments of their own party

The Trump administration and governments in Ottawa and Mexico City have indicated they will renegotiate the trilateral, quarter - century - old North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ). While the existing accord enjoys the support of roughly three - quarters of the Canadian public and six - in - ten Mexicans, it is viewed less favorably in the United States, with Republicans far less supportive than Democrats, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of all three countries. About half of Americans ( 51 % ) say NAFTA has been a good thing for the U.S., including 11 % who say it has been very good. That compares with 74 % o

By contrast, only about 1 % of those born in the U.S. live outside of the United States. Among the 10 countries with the highest number of emigrants, the UK is the only Western European country to appear on the list. Other top origin countries of emigrants include India ( 15.6 million ), Mexico ( 12.3 million ) and Russia ( 10.6 million ).
About one - in - five Kenyans ( 21 % ) and Colombians ( 17 % ) also use feature phones.
The economy and jobs : Americans ’ views of economic conditions are more positive than they have been in recent years. An October survey found 41 % of Americans rating economic conditions in the country as “ excellent ” or “ good, ” near the highest point in a decade. The public ’s improving economic outlook is reflected in its policy agenda for Trump and Congress in the coming year. Economic issues – improving the job situation, strengthening the economy and reducing the budget deficit – are now viewed as less important policy priorities than they were just a few years ago, according to a survey conducted earlier this month.

Half of the public also favors U.S. policies to maintain America ’s position as the only superpower, while 35 % say it woul
In 2019, what proportion of households with incomes less than $30,000 per year were “smartphone dependent” Internet users?With fewer options for online access at their disposal, many lower - income Americans are relying more on smartphones.

In school, teens see more value in some proposed measures than others. Asked to assess how effective various measures would be at preventing school shootings, 86 % of teens say that preventing people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns and that improving mental health screening and treatment would be effective, including majorities who say each of these proposals would be very effective. Roughly eight - in - ten teens ( 79 % ) say that having metal detectors in schools would be effective and 66 % say the same about banning assault - style weapons.

They are also around three times as likely to express worry ( 67 % ) than enthusiasm ( 22 % ) about algorithms that can make hiring decisions without any human involvement. By comparison, public views towards driverless vehicles and robot caregivers exhibit more balance between worry and enthusiasm.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds 44 % of Americans have a favorable opinion of China, up from 37 % a year ago. The growth in positive ratings for China may be due in part to declining concerns about economic threats from China. The share of the public that sees the amount of U.S. debt held by Beijing, the loss of jobs to China and the trade deficit with China as very serious problems has dropped significantly in recent years. For example, 61 % said the trade deficit was a very serious problem in 2012, compared with 44 % today. Concerns about Chinese cyberattacks have, on the other hand, rose to 5
In Spain, 62 % say use of force is sometimes necessary while Germans are evenly divided with half saying the use of force is sometimes necessary and half saying it is not.
About three - in - four Indians express confidence in Obama, up from 48 % in 2014. It ’s been a year of high - profile visits in the U.S.-India relationship. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the U.S. last September, and Obama traveled to India in January. The trip seems to have increased Indians ’ familiarity with the American president – the share of the public with no opinion about Obama dropped from 37 % last year to 17 % today.

About a quarter ( 26 % ) say they followed news about the economy more closely than other major stories. News about the economy accounted for 12 % of the newshole measured by PEJ. That does not include 4 % of coverage devoted to the debate over whether to extend expiring Bush - era tax cuts. The tax debate was the most closely followed story for 7 % ; about two - in - ten ( 21 % ) say they followed this story very closely.
About two - in - ten ( 21 % ) say they followed news about the widespread recall of Toyota cars and trucks – and a temporary halt to sales of certain models – because of problems with sudden acceleration. Just 5 % say this is the story they followed most closely.
About three - in - ten say the same in Venezuela ( 31 % ), Colombia ( 29 % ) and Mexico ( 27 % ).
The two - thirds of Americans also said scientists would offer life extension technologies before their impact was fully understood.

A 47 - nation 2007 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that, among the seven major world regions included in the study, support for free markets was lowest in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Across the six Eastern European countries surveyed — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine — a median of 56 % agreed with the statement “ Most people are better off in a free market economy, even though some people are rich and some are poor. ” While support for free - market economics tends to be lower in Eastern Europe than in other parts of the globe, it is not uniformly low in the region. For example, i

Three - quarters ( 76 % ) of Americans say the government is doing very ( 27 % ) or fairly ( 49 % ) well in reducing the threat of terrorism, and for most of the past ten years, at least two - thirds of the American public, including majorities across party lines, have offered this generally positive assessment. While 2007 was an extreme, there has been a partisan divide in assessments of government performance on terrorism from the very beginning. The direction of this gap switched when Barack Obama took office. From 2001 through 2008 Democrats offered decidedly more critical views of government performance on terrorism. But by October 2010, Democrats expressed more positive views o
Consistent with this, as many Romney as Obama voters express strong support for their candidate. This continues the pattern seen in the Pew Research poll in early October, after the first presidential debate, which represented a shift from polling earlier in the year when Romney ’s support was much more tepid.
Survey respondents who said they believe in God with no doubts also disagreed most strongly ( 61 % ) with the statement “ In my opinion, life does not serve any purpose. ” Those who said they were certain they did not believe in God or who expressed more uncertainty about their belief were less likely than strong believers to reject the statement that life has no purpose. ( Only 49 % said they strongly disagreed ). There were no statistically significant differences between those who were uncertain and those who did not believe in God.
As with other climate issues, there are sizable political divides over the effects of climate policies. About eight - in - ten liberal Democrats ( 78 % ) say climate change policies do more good than harm, compared with 56 % of moderate or conservative Democrats.

By September 2016, a 57 % majority of these voters had warmed to him, including 24 % who felt very warmly. And shortly after the election, three - quarters of these once cold or neutral voters ( 74 % ) felt warmly toward him, including 43 % who rated him very warmly. Among the 65 % majority of Trump voters who felt warmly toward him in April 2016, there was much less change in opinions about him. Of this group, 90 % or more maintained warm feelings toward hi
The gender gap in 2008 – the seven - point difference between women and men in support for the Democratic candidate – was comparable to the gap in most elections since 1980. Even when Democratic candidates failed to garner a majority of the women ’s vote – as in 1980, 1984 and 1988 – they still drew more support from women than from men. The election of 1992 was unusual because of Ross Perot ’s popular third - party campaign. Still, the gender gap was significant : Women backed Bill Clinton over George H.W. Bush, 45 % to 37 %, with 17 % supporting Perot. Clinton had a narrower lead amon

In 1960, half ( 49 % ) of poor Americans lived in the South. By 2010, that share had dropped to 41 %. Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period. As rural areas, such as in the Midwest, have become less impoverished since the 1960s, those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall. At the same time, urban centers have gained in total population and hold a greater share of the U.S. population overall.

About half of each social network ’s users ( 47 % for Facebook, 52 % for Twitter ) reported getting news there. ( In both studies, we defined news as “ information about events and issues beyond just friends and family. ” ) This increase in exposure to news among users emerges even as overall usage of each site has remained steady since 2013 : 17 % of U.S. adults use Twitter and two - thirds ( 66 % ) use Facebook. Overall, 10 % of all U.S. adults get news on Twitter, and 41 % get news on Facebook.
In today ’s technology - driven world, is it best for children to hone their science and math skills to catch up with other countries that outperform the U.S.? Or is it best for them to be more well - rounded, with strong arts and athletic skills as well? Or perhaps parents should instead focus on encouraging less tangible skills in their kids, such as teamwork, logic and basic communication skills.

When it comes to job opportunities, 57 % say that jobs are difficult to find in their community, while 36 % say that there are plenty of jobs available, according to our recent survey. Views of job availability have edged higher over the past several years as the unemployment rate has declined.

The number of babies born to Christian mothers ( 223 million ) far outnumbered the number of births to Muslim mothers ( 213 million ) between 2010 and 2015. However, an aging Christian population – especially in Europe and North America – and high fertility rates among Muslim women is rapidly changing the global religious landscape. The number of births to Muslim women is projected to exceed births to Christian women by 2030 - 2035, with the disparity growing to 6 million by 2055 - 2060.

A deep analysis of local news in Denver, Macon, Ga., and Sioux City, Iowa, finds that in each city at least three - in - ten people follow crime very closely and more than half of residents often discuss crime with others. Interest in crime, though, is not equal across all residents in these cities, as seen in Denver and Macon, where racial and ethnic subgroups were large enough to analyze.

The gap between Obama ’s and Clinton ’s visibility has grown substantially over the last two weeks from roughly equal visibility in early March, when 38 % had been hearing most about Obama, 37 % about Clinton. The drop in Clinton ’s public visibility is also consistent with the amount of coverage her campaign received in recent weeks.

Separately, 15 % of teens say Instagram is the platform they use “ most often. ” That ’s lower than the shares who say the same about Snapchat ( 35 % ) and YouTube ( 32 % ).
Indian Americans generally are well - off. Median annual household income for Indian Americans in 2010 was $ 88,000, much higher than for all Asian Americans ( $ 66,000 ) and all U.S. households ( $ 49,800 ) — perhaps not surprising, given their high education levels. Only 9 % of adult Indian Americans live in poverty, compared with 12 % of Asian Americans overall and 13 % of the U.S. population. In 2010, by our analysis, 28 % of Indian American worked in science and engineering fields ; according to the 2013 American Community Survey, more than two - thirds ( 69.3 %
