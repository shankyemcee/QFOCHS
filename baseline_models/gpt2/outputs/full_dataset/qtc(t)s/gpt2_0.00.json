    "The disparate trends in the jobs recovery from 2009 to 2011 reflect the rapidly changing demographics of the American workforce. Although jobs growth for Hispanics and Asians was more rapid than for other groups, it merely kept pace with the growth in their working - age ( ages 16 and older ) populations. The slower rate of jobs growth for whites and blacks reflects the relatively slow growth in their populations. Thus, the share of each group \u2019s population that is employed, the employment rate, has barely risen since the end of the recession, according to new Pew Research Center analysis of government data."
