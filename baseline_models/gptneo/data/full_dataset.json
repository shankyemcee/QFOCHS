One example involves public support for the products of scientific and technological innovation . A Pew Research Center survey found that about two - thirds of people see the effects of science on society as mostly positive , which is consistent with some 35 years of data from the General Social Survey . Looking at the components of trust in science across these three scientific areas \u2014 vaccines , climate change , and GM food \u2014 two patterns stand out . First , public trust in scientists is stronger , by comparison , than it is for several other groups in society . For example , many more people report trust in information from medical scientists , climate scientists , and GM food scientists than information from industry leaders , the news media , and elected officials . On the other hand , no more than about half of people hold strongly trusting views of scientists in any of these domains .
