1353,1353.png,Declining majority story of Americans believe biblical Christmas story reflects historical events % who believe Jesus was born to a virgin,"4 Americans have long argued about whether nativity scenes and other religious holiday displays on public property violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution ’s First Amendment . In the 1980s , the Supreme Court handed down two landmark rulings that allow for displays of Christmas crèches , Hanukkah menorah and other religious holiday symbols on public property so long as they do not actively endorse or promote a particular religion or religion in general . In practice , religious symbols that are a part of larger secular holiday display ( containing , say , Christmas trees , Santa Claus and reindeer ) have had a much better chance of surviving a court challenge than those displays that are solely or more overtly religious . 5 Most Americans believe that elements of the biblical Christmas story reflect actual historical events , although the percentage expressing this view has dropped noticeably in recent years . Two - thirds ( 66 % ) say Jesus was born to a virgin , compared with 73 % who said this in 2014 ; 75 % believe he was laid in a manger , down from 81 % . Similarly , the shares who say they believe that wise men , guided by a star , brought Jesus gifts — and that an angel appeared to shepherds to announce the birth of Jesus — also have declined . A slim majority of U.S. adults ( 57 % ) believe that all four of these things actually happened , down from 65 % three years ago .

In the 1980s , the Supreme Court handed down two landmark rulings that allow for displays of Christmas crèches , Hanukkah menorah and other religious holiday symbols on public property so long as they do not actively endorse or promote a particular religion or religion in general . In practice , religious symbols that are a part of larger secular holiday display ( containing , say , Christmas trees , Santa Claus and reindeer ) have had a much better chance of surviving a court challenge than those displays that are solely or more overtly religious . 5 Most Americans believe that elements of the biblical Christmas story reflect actual historical events , although the percentage expressing this view has dropped noticeably in recent years . Two - thirds ( 66 % ) say Jesus was born to a virgin , compared with 73 % who said this in 2014 ; 75 % believe he was laid in a manger , down from 81 % . Similarly , the shares who say they believe that wise men , guided by a star , brought Jesus gifts — and that an angel appeared to shepherds to announce the birth of Jesus — also have declined . A slim majority of U.S. adults ( 57 % ) believe that all four of these things actually happened , down from 65 % three years ago .

869,869.png,"Most in Taiwan identify as Taiwanese, but there are large partisan differences","Seventy years after the end of the Chinese Civil War , about two - thirds of adults in Taiwan identify as just Taiwanese . On the other hand , about three - in - ten ( 28 % ) see themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese . The question asks respondents whether they consider themselves Taiwanese , Chinese or both . A mere 4 % see themselves as only Chinese . These findings are consistent with other polls showing that people in Taiwan increasingly identify only as Taiwanese as opposed to both Taiwanese and Chinese or solely Chinese . Adults in Taiwan across all age groups are likely to see themselves as Taiwanese .

585,585.png,Americans and Germans see bilateral relationship as more important than close relations with China,"While many Americans and Germans name China as the most important partner , negative attitudes toward the Asian superpower have increased in both countries over the past year . The two publics have also become more likely to prioritize U.S.-German ties over relations with China . In the September 2020 survey , 55 % of Americans prefer to have a close relationship with Germany rather than China ( 35 % ) .

246,246.png,Mobile now more than half of all digital advertising spending,"Digital ad spending went up 20 % last year , and mobile advertising now tops desktop , but journalism organizations have not been the primary beneficiaries . There was explosive growth in mobile advertising , which increased by 65 % , reaching $ 32 billion – higher than desktop advertising for the first year ever .

Meanwhile , over the same period , Puerto Ricans made up a larger share of the state ’s Hispanic eligible voters , rising from 25 % to 27 % . These changes have been driven by the outmigration of Puerto Ricans from the island to central Florida and the movement of Puerto Rican - origin Hispanics in the northeast U.S. to central Florida .

In 2014 , Cubans made up a smaller share ( 31 % ) of Hispanic eligible voters – adult U.S. citizens – in Florida than they did in 1990 ( 46 % ) . Meanwhile , over the same period , Puerto Ricans made up a larger share of the state ’s Hispanic eligible voters , rising from 25 % to 27 % . These changes have been driven by the outmigration of Puerto Ricans from the island to central Florida and the movement of Puerto Rican - origin Hispanics in the northeast U.S. to central Florida .

1566,1566.png,"Lower-income teens are more likely than teens from higher-income households to use Facebook % of U.S. teens, by annual household income, who say they use Facebook ","For the most part , teens tend to use similar platforms regardless of their demographic characteristics , but there are exceptions . Notably , lower - income teens are more likely to gravitate toward Facebook than those from higher - income households – a trend consistent with previous Center surveys . Seven - in - ten teens living in households earning less than $ 30,000 a year say they use Facebook , compared with 36 % whose annual family income is $ 75,000 or more . ( For details on social media platform use by different demographic groups , see Appendix A. ) Again , lower - income teens are far more likely than those from higher income households to say Facebook is the online platform they use most often ( 22 % vs. 4 % ) .
