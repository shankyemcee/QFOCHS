The current ratings are somewhat more negative : Just 27 % say Trump has set a high moral standard for the presidency , while 71 % say he has not done this . Republicans are divided in their assessment of Trump in this area : 51 % say he definitely or probably set a high moral standard for the presidency , while 47 % say he definitely or probably has not .

Before the election , 89 % of Democrats anticipated that Trump would not set a high moral standard for the presidency ; today , about the same share ( 92 % ) say he has not done this . Still , more Democrats say he has definitely not set a high moral standard for the presidency than said he definitely would do this in the pre - election survey ( 81 % now , 69 % then ) . Similarly , before the election an overwhelming share of Democrats ( 91 % ) said Trump would definitely or probably not improve the country ’s global standing ; today , 90 % say he has not achieved this objective . Republicans ’ views also have changed little since before the election : Currently , 72 % say he has improved the U.S. global standing ; 70 % expected he would do this before his election victory . And while 84 % of Democrats say Trump has improperly used his office to enrich himself , his family or friends , 79 % expected he would do this before the election .

ratings among members of both parties for setting a high moral standard for the presidency <s> Across five evaluations in the survey , Trump gets his most negative ratings for setting a high moral standard for the presidency . The public ’s pre - election expectations were already quite low : In November 2016 , just 33 % of Americans said that if Trump was elected he definitely or probably would set high moral standard for the presidency ; twice as many ( 66 % ) said he definitely or probably would not do this . The current ratings are somewhat more negative : Just 27 % say Trump has set a high moral standard for the presidency , while 71 % say he has not done this . Republicans are divided in their assessment of Trump in this area : 51 % say he definitely or probably set a high moral standard for the presidency , while 47 % say he definitely or probably has not . Just prior to the election , 60 % of Republicans said they expected Trump would set a high moral standard . Before the election , 89 % of Democrats anticipated that Trump would not set a high moral standard for the presidency ; today , about the same share ( 92 % ) say he has not done this . Still , more Democrats say he has definitely not set a high moral standard for the presidency than said he definitely would do this in the pre - election survey ( 81 % now , 69 % then ) . Similarly , before the election an overwhelming share of Democrats ( 91 % ) said Trump would definitely or probably not improve the country ’s global standing ; today , 90 % say he has not achieved this objective . Republicans ’ views also have changed little since before the election : Currently , 72 % say he has improved the U.S. global standing ; 70 % expected he would do this before his election victory . And while 84 % of Democrats say Trump has improperly used his office to enrich himself , his family or friends , 79 % expected he would do this before the election . Prior to the election , just 29 % of Republicans said Trump definitely or probably would use the office of the presidency for personal gain ; today , even fewer Republicans ( 21 % ) say has definitely or probably done this . <s> the gets relatively low ratings among members of both parties for setting a high | moral standard for the presidency | % who say Donald Trump would (2016) say Donald Trump has (2018) | Definitely Probably | Probably not | Definitely not | standing Improve(d) the country's | Set a high moral standard | Improperly use(d) the office to enrich | standing around the world | for the presidency | Improperly himself or use(d) his friends and family | TOTAL REP/LEAN DEM/LEAN | TOTAL REP/LEAN DEM/LEAN | TOTAL REP/LEAN DEMYLEAN | REP | DEM | REP | DEM | REP | DEM | 79 84 | 70 72 | 60 | 56 55 | 51 | 27 | 46 59 | 19 | 44 | 36 36 | 33 27 | 20 | 35 | 29 | 21 | 10 | 20 15 | 28 22 | 42 52 | 40 47 | 29 28 | 40 47 | 69 81 | 76 | 43 43 | 28 41 | 66 | 62 62 | 66 71 | 70 | 79 | 91 90 | 89 92 | 16 18 | 16 18 | 16 118 | '16 18 | '16 18 | ""16 '18 | '16 18 | ""16 '18 | 16 '18 | Note: Don 'tknow/No answer responses notshown. 30-Aug | Source: Survey ofU.S. adults conducted Uuly 30-Aug 12 2018 | PEW RESEARCH CENTER"

But Kaiser found some wiggle room in the opinions of those in the higher or lower cost camps . When the 37 % of the overall public who said they preferred the lower cost plans were asked if they would still feel the same if they found out they would not be able to visit the doctors or hospitals they usually use , the percentage saying they would stick with that option fell to 23 % . On the flip side of the question , when the Americans who said they preferred the more expensive , broader plans were told they could save about 25 % on health care costs by going for narrower plans , the share of those choosing the more costly option dropped from 51 % to 37 % . <s> Preferences For Narrow Versus Broad Network Plans | Which type of health insurance plan would you rather have? a plan that.., | Costs less money but has a more limited range of | Costs more money but allows you to see | doctors and hospitals that you are allowed to see | broader range of doctors and hospitals | Total Public | 37% | 51% | Employer -Sponsored insurance (age 18- 64) | 34% | 55% | 54% | Uninsured or purchase own insurance (age 18-64) | 35% | AISER | NOTE: Neitheraf thesc/scomething.kik NOL) and Don't Know/Reiused responses.nct shown | SOURCE: Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Pall icanducted February 11-17 2014)"

1085,1085.png,Majority of older Facebook users do not understand why certain posts are included in their news feed,"A sizable majority of U.S. adults use Facebook and most of its users get news on the site . But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that notable shares of Facebook users ages 18 and older lack a clear understanding of how the site ’s news feed operates , feel ordinary users have little control over what appears there , and have not actively tried to influence the content the feed delivers to them . The findings from the survey – conducted May 29 - June 11 – come amid a debate over the power of major online platforms , the algorithms that underpin those platforms and the nature of the content those algorithms surface to users . Facebook ’s broad reach and impact mean that its news feed is one of the most prominent examples of a content algorithm in many Americans ’ lives . When asked whether they understand why certain posts but not others are included in their news feed , around half of U.S. adults who use Facebook ( 53 % ) say they do not – with 20 % saying they do not understand the feed at all well . Older users are especially likely to say they do not understand the workings of the news feed : Just 38 % of Facebook users ages 50 and older say they have a good understanding of why certain posts are included in it , compared with 59 % of users ages 18 to 29 .",Describe Americans knowledge about Facebook news feed?,"When asked whether they understand why certain posts but not others are included in their news feed , around half of U.S. adults who use Facebook ( 53 % ) say they do not – with 20 % saying they do not understand the feed at all well .

But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that notable shares of Facebook users ages 18 and older lack a clear understanding of how the site ’s news feed operates , feel ordinary users have little control over what appears there , and have not actively tried to influence the content the feed delivers to them . The findings from the survey – conducted May 29 - June 11 – come amid a debate over the power of major online platforms , the algorithms that underpin those platforms and the nature of the content those algorithms surface to users . Facebook ’s broad reach and impact mean that its news feed is one of the most prominent examples of a content algorithm in many Americans ’ lives . When asked whether they understand why certain posts but not others are included in their news feed , around half of U.S. adults who use Facebook ( 53 % ) say they do not – with 20 % saying they do not understand the feed at all well .

525,525.png,"Most see a place for anonymous sources in the news, but say they should not be used at will","In recent years there has been renewed interest in the debate over journalists ’ use of anonymous sources , and this has included criticism directly from President Donald Trump . Survey data from earlier this year shows that most Americans see a place for journalists to use anonymous sources , but few think journalists should have carte blanche to use them when reporting the news .

A very small share of Americans ( 3 % ) think Julie ’s initial disagreement with her friends counts as online harassment . Some 43 % consider it harassment when she begins to receive unkind messages , while around one - in - five ( 17 % ) consider it harassment when her post is shared by the popular blogger with thousands of followers . Meanwhile , substantial majorities of Americans think Julie is being harassed when she receives vulgar messages about her looks and sexual behavior ( 85 % ) , when her picture is edited to include sexual images ( 84 % ) , and when she receives threatening messages ( 85 % ) . For example , some 43 % of Americans consider it to be online harassment when Julie receives unkind messages from the people reading her post – but just 20 % think that the platform should have stepped in to address that behavior when it occurred .

Majorities said their country should cooperate more with each of these powers , but there were large variations in the strength of the responses . For example , nine - in - ten in Germany said the country should cooperate more with France . But only 56 % of Germans wanted to cooperate more with the U.S. , while about a third would cooperate less ( 34 % ) . When the Center asked the same question of Americans in October , majorities in the U.S. also said their country should cooperate more with Great Britain , France , Germany and China .

","Half say using military force against countries that may seriously threaten the U.S. – but have not attacked it – can often ( 12 % ) or sometimes ( 38 % ) be justified , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October . About as many ( 48 % ) say such pre - emptive use of military force can rarely ( 28 % ) or never ( 20 % ) be justified .
