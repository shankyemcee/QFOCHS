The same Pew Research report found that majorities of graduates in all three of the largest U.S. generations Boomers, Gen-Xers and Millennials agree that college either has paid off or will pay off, given what they and their families invested in it. Perhaps not surprisingly, the highest-earning graduates were the most positive about their educations 98% of those making six figures and up said their degree had paid off, compared with 63% of graduates earning less than $50,000. Similarly, people with advanced degrees were even more likely than bachelor s and associate s degree holders to say their education was worth the investment 96%, compared with 89% and 76%, respectively.

When Americans who said they had heard at least a little about QAnon were asked to write in their own words what they thought it was, they were most likely to describe it as a group of some kind or include a more specific description of it as a conspiracy group or theory. Far fewer wrote in other kinds of descriptions. Two-in-ten mentioned that it is a right-wing group or theory (20%) or that it is a theory about child abuse or trafficking (20%). Another 16% connected it directly to President Donald Trump, either by saying that Trump supports the group or that the group views him as a hero, savior or victim.

60% of men and 52% of women in that age group lived at home in 2012, an 8-percentage-point gap. In 1968, 59% of male 18- to 24-year-olds, but only 42% of females lived at home: a difference of 17 percentage points. One factor that has contributed to the growing gender parity in living at home is the rise in the share of young women who go to college. (In the Census data used for our analysis, college students who live in dormitories during the academic year are counted as living with their parents.) In 1968, only 19.5% of 18- to 24-year-old females were enrolled in college, compared with 34% of their male peers. That ratio has flipped; as of 2011, 44% of women and 38% of men ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in college, a 6-percentage-point advantage for women.
Nearly two-in-ten (17%) say they followed the controversy over the pastor s announcement that he would burn Korans on Sept. 11 more closely than any other major story.

About half (52%) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey, while 37% say it is having a bad influence
More than a quarter of Chinese volunteer that schools should emphasize both creative thinking and basic skills and discipline. This may be due in part to their educational system s reliance on standardized testing (the gaokao). While rote memorization and discipline are seen as keys for success on this future-defining exam, there is much handwringing domestically about how gaokao preparation comes at the expense of more creative opportunities. Younger, wealthier and better educated Chinese are particularly likely to prioritize imagination and creativity in the classroom. Note: See here for topline results, economic categorization information and methodology.
Overall, men owned more than half of the nation s 27.6 million firms in 2012, according to preliminary results from the Survey of Business Owners, and women owned more than 9.9 million businesses, about 36% of the total.

This is lower than in 2008, when 79% were registered to vote and in 2004 (76% registered to vote). In polls conducted from January to September, just half of those under 30 are certain they are registered to vote 11 points lower than in 2008 and the lowest number in the past 16 years of Pew Research Center polling. There also has been a nine-point decline in voter registration among those 30-to-49. Voter registration has slipped four points among those 50-to-64 but is virtually unchanged among those 65 and older
Republicans and Democrats also diverge in their views about how gun ownership impacts crime and mass shootings in the U.S. A majority of Republicans (56%) say there would be less crime if more Americans owned guns; by contrast, 51% of Democrats say there would be more crime if more Americans had guns. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats (64%) say there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were harder for people to legally obtain guns; only about a quarter of Republicans (27%) say the same. And Republicans are skeptical that making it harder to legally obtain guns would have an effect on mass shootings: 54% say it would not make a difference, while 18% think restricting access to guns would lead to more mass shootings.
Almost two-thirds of U.S. adults now watch videos online and more than half of those (36%) watch news videos
The gender gap in average years of schooling illustrates this trend. The youngest Muslim men in sub-Saharan Africa gained 2.4 more years of schooling, on average, than the oldest Muslim men, while the youngest Muslim women gained only 1.7 more years of schooling over their elders. But in other regions, Muslim women have gained on men. In Europe, for instance, Muslim women and men average virtually the same number of years of schooling among the youngest generation analyzed, and in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East-North Africa regions together home to most of the world s Muslims the gaps have narrowed considerably.
Hispanic support of Democratic candidates remained strong in our February survey. In a generic congressional ballot, Hispanics would favor the Democrat candidates for Congress in their district over Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin (63%-31%). That margin is roughly the same as in 2010, when the split on Election Day was 60% to 38%, in favor of Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives, according to National Election Pool exit polls. But it s worth noting that Hispanic turnout has lagged behind the rest of the public in past elections. Despite a fast-growing population that makes up 11% of the nation s eligible voters (U.S. citizen adults), Hispanics made up just 8% of the electorate in 2012 and 7% in 2010. See our general public questionnaire results and methodology. Note: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated the percentage of eligible voters (U.S. citizen adults) that Hispanics comprise. It is 11%.

Nevertheless, nearly nine-in-ten Republicans (87%) say it is at least somewhat important. Very few Republicans or Democrats regard this issue as not important. More women than men say the issue of sexual assault and harassment is very important. And adults younger than 30 are more likely to view this issue as very important than are people 50 and older. Note: See full topline results and methodology (PDF).

The views of Millennials are not significantly different than earlier this year. Baby Boomers (51% legal, 46% illegal) and those in Generation X (54% legal, 44% illegal) are about evenly divided over marijuana legalization, while the majority of those in the Silent Generation are opposed (66% illegal, 27% legal). Democrats continue to support legalization by about two-to-one (64%-34%). But just 31% of Republicans say marijuana should be legal, down 8 points from February.
Because the open-ended question asked respondents to use one single word to describe your experiences using social networking sites, the adjectives that were shared point to both the user s interactions on the sites and the functionality of the interface. For instance, one user described her experiences on the sites as noisy while another used the word, glitches.
Fewer Democratic voters among those with some college experience but no degree (43%) and those with no college experience (34%) characterized their political views as liberal or very liberal in 2019. Just 13% of Democrats with some college education and 11% of Democrats with no college education described their own views as very liberal. Americans descriptions of their political views are distinct from, but strongly related to, their attitudes on specific issues. Most Americans continue to express at least some mix of liberal and conservative attitudes, but the share with either uniformly liberal or uniformly conservative attitudes has grown in recent years. Note: This is an update of a post previously published Sept. 7, 2017.

many online economic users turn to the internet as a diversion; however, these individuals engage in a wide range of more serious online pursuits as well. For example, fully 76% of those who have gone online to relax or take their minds off of the economy have also gone online to find the lowest price on something they need to buy. Additionally: These individuals are also active in posting their own original online content: 10% of those who go online as a diversion have posted their comments about the recession in an online discussion group or other online forum, and 9% have done so on a blog (their own or someone else s).

they have comparable levels of trust in major technology firms to consistently do what is right; are equally likely to think that these companies support the views of a particular gender or political affiliation over others; and are equally likely to say the impact of these companies on society as a whole has been more good than bad. On other questions, there are more pronounced differences between the attitudes of older and younger Americans with older adults typically taking a more broadly pessimistic view of these firms and their overall impact. For instance, larger shares of older adults think major technology companies often fail to anticipate how their products and services will impact society, that these companies have too much power and influence in today s society, and that they should be regulated more than they are currently.

In Nigeria, 37% say a strong relationship with China is more important, compared with just 17% who say this about the U.S. (the question was not asked in Egypt or Tunisia). However, in all of these countries a sizeable minority volunteer that having strong ties with both is equally important, reflecting the view that both of these major powers can play a positive role in the continent s future.
Republicans and GOP leaners who say abortion should be illegal in all cases are more likely to say they agree strongly with the GOP on abortion than to say they agree somewhat (73% vs. 9%).

Clinton backers are solidly opposed regardless of strength of support for her candidacy. Fully 88% of Clinton supporters express opposition, compared with 10% who are in favor of a wall along the entire border with Mexico.
Nearly seven-in-ten liberals support gay marriage and eight-in-ten support civil unions, up from 59% and 70%, respectively in 2004.

Those with high openness to new experiences are more inclined to have strong preferences for trying both new food and technology products (21% do so among those with higher openness to experience compared with 13% among those with lower openness). See the topline questionnaire and methodology for this survey.

Gabrielle Giffords most closely, double the 17% that said they were following news about the economy most closely. Coming at the end of the week, the Tucson shootings were not a major factor in analysis of the full week s coverage. (Next week s News Interest Index and News Coverage Index will include public interest in and coverage of the Arizona shootings.) During the first three days interviewing (Jan. 6-8), the economy was the top story for the public, with 26% following economic news most closely compared with 13% who cited news about incoming Republican leaders

Historically, fertility has dropped during economic recessions. By comparison, women born in Puerto Rico who move to the U.S. mainland have more babies than those who stay on the island. In 2013, the average total fertility rate was 2.1 for Puerto Rican-born women living in the U.S.

Public interest in Iraq news was also modest in the ten weeks in which public interest in Iraq-related news was tested, roughly a quarter of Americans said they were following very closely , but about one-in-ten rated it as the top story they followed most closely. The exception to this came in early September, when 17% said they were following news about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq more closely than any other story
During the first two years of the nation s economic recovery, the mean net worth of households in the upper 7% of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28%, while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93% dropped by 4%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of newly released Census Bureau data. From 2009 to 2011, the mean wealth of the 8 million households in the more affluent group rose to an estimated $3,173,895 from an estimated $2,476,244, while the mean wealth of the 111 million households in the less affluent group fell to an estimated $133,817 from an estimated $139,896. These wide variances were driven by the fact that the stock and bond markets rallied during the 2009 to 2011 period while the housing market remained relatively flat. Affluent households typically have their assets concentrated in stocks and other financial holdings, while less affluent households typically have their wealth more heavily concentrated in the value of their home.

In 2016, 42% of young Millennial workers in metro areas held a bachelor s degree, an increase from 34% of young Gen X workers in 2000. By contrast, just 24% of young workers in non-metro areas in 2016 had completed college, up from 20% in 2000. The increase in educational attainment among Millennials comes as the economic payoffs of a bachelor s degree particularly in terms of earnings are greater now than they were in the past.

A Pew Research Center analysis last year found that the 10 largest counties by Hispanic population accounted for 22% of the national Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2011. Half of these counties are located in California. Nationally, Mexicans are the largest Hispanic origin group but the composition of origin groups varies by geographic area. For example, while Mexicans represent a majority of Hispanics in all but 11 states, Puerto Ricans are the largest group in New York and New Jersey and Cubans are most populous in Florida. The demographics of each origin group vary significantly. For example, Hispanics of Mexican origin are the youngest out of the 14 largest origin groups, with a median age of 25, compared with Cubans median age of 40. Venezuelans are the most likely to have a college degree (51%), compared with 7% of both Guatemalans and Salvadorans.

9Russians give Trump higher marks than they gave Obama or Bush. Amid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. and its president have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russians ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 the last time the Center polled in Russia favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common, and Trump gets better reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.
In 2016, many people across the nations polled say the U.S. is the world s leading economic power. Australia stands out as the one nation polled where at least half (52%) say China is the top economy in the world, compared with 32% who say it is the U.S. Relatively few respondents in these 16 nations think Japan or the countries of the European Union are the globe s leading economic power, although 25% of Germans say it is the EU countries

In comparison, there is less enthusiasm for growing commerce with China, although slightly more Americans see doing business with China as a positive rather than a negative (51% good vs. 45% bad). The Japanese are about twice as likely to favor the TPP agreement than not. Roughly half of Japanese (52%) support Japan s participation in the TPP, according to a November 2013 poll by Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan s main national newspapers. Only 25% of respondents would like to see Japan reject the pact.
turnout among eligible voters in the Silent Generation peaked at 76% in the 1992 election. The Millennial and Gen X generations are likely still on the upswing in terms of their turnout rates, so it is a reasonable guess that at least 54.5% of these adults will vote, and perhaps more. We won t know until after November if Boomers and their elders will pass the torch to Gen X and Millennials as a share of voters, but all the available data suggest that the 2016 election will mark the beginning of a new era for U.S. presidential elections.
The ranks of photographers, artists and videographers have been trimmed by nearly half (43%) from 6,171 in 2000 to 3,493 in 2012, according to ASNE. By comparison, the number of full-time newspaper reporters and writers dropped by 32% from 25,593 to 17,422. In the same period, 27% of copy and layout editor and online producer jobs were lost, falling from 10,901 to 7,980
Americans who mentioned some dissatisfaction with government leadership as the top problem doubled to the 33% mark, compared to 16% last month. The survey found Democrats (36%) and independents (33%) as more likely than Republicans (23%) to name dysfunctional government as the top problem. Gallup noted that this finding comes at a time when Congressional approval is within one percentage point of the lowest in history in its polls, (10% in February and August of 2012). The current standing of Congress is also significantly lower than during the 1995-96 shutdown period when it ranged from 30% to 35%. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in late September found that 26% of Americans were angry and another 51% frustrated at the federal government. About half (48%) of those surveyed said the main reason Congress can t get things done was that the parties had grown so far apart, while 36% said the cause was a few members who refuse to compromise.
Middle Eastern publics see both the U.S. and Russia playing more important roles in the region today than they did 10 years ago. At least half in all of the nations surveyed say Russia is more influential now compared with a decade ago

Among the 6% of Republicans and Republican leaners who say that white people have a great deal of advantage over black people, just 39% approve of Trump s job performance. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who say whites benefit a great deal from societal advantages, nearly all (97%) disapprove of Trump s performance, including 88% who disapprove strongly. By contrast, among Democrats who say whites do not benefit too much or do not benefit at all from societal advantages, 81% disapprove of Trump, with 64% saying they disapprove strongly. Note: Topline is available here (PDF), and methodology is here.
The survey also finds that the current U.S. government policy of banning the payment of ransom money for hostages held by terrorist groups has widespread approval. Though the policy has come under some recent criticism, 70% approve of the current U.S. government policy while just 25% disapprove
More than half of the public (56%) says they have a favorable opinion of Barack Obama, down from 65% in November 2009. About seven-in-ten (69%) say they have a favorable opinion of Michelle Obama, about the same as the 71% that said this in November

His favorable rating is 31 percentage points higher than that of Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Congress party, and is 30 points more than that for Rahul Gandhi, who led the Congress ticket in the last Lok Sabha election
In 2018, 1.7 million workers 2.1% of all hourly paid workers had wages at or below the current federal minimum wage, according to the BLS. Twenty-nine states, plus the District of Columbia and many cities and counties, have set their own higher minimums. But wide disparities in the cost of living in different parts of the country and even within individual states complicate the policy debate. Note: This is an update of a post originally published Sept. 3, 2015.
Of course, Latinos also have several other terms at their disposal to describe their identity and these are often preferred over Hispanic or Latino. When asked which term they use most often to describe themselves, 54% use Hispanic origin terms such as Mexican, Cuban, or Dominican and 23% say they use the term American. Another 20% say they use the more broad terms, either Hispanic or Latino. It turns out this is true of Hispanics in Texas as well: about half (47%) say that they most often use their Hispanic origin term to describe themselves, 30% use the term American, and 21% use the pan-ethnic terms Hispanic or Latino most often to describe their identity.
More than half of the public (52%) paid very close attention to news about gas prices, and 27% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. By comparison, 33% followed the situation in Iraq very closely, and 23% listed Iraq as their top news story of the week

In each country in the region, more name the U.S. as their most dependable ally than any other country in an open-ended question, including around two-thirds or more in Japan (63%), the Philippines (64%) and South Korea (71%). Each country in the region also prefers strong economic ties with the U.S. (a median of 64%) rather than China (26%) and often by a wide margin. In Australia and South Korea, this is a reversal of 2015 opinion, when more preferred close economic relations with China.
Democrats and Democratic leaners are much more concerned that their representatives in Congress will not do enough to oppose Donald Trump and his policies than they are that congressional Democrats will go too far in their opposition (72% vs. 20%). There are modest differences in these views across subgroups of Democrats: Large majorities of liberal Democrats (77%) and conservative and moderate Democrats (68%) both say their bigger concern is that Democrats in Congress will not do enough to oppose Trump s policies.

For more: Read a Q&A about how and why we conducted the survey with its author, Maeve Duggan.
household income for households in the middle (median household income) increased 19% from 1967 to 2012. But the threshold to qualify for the richest 5% of households increased 67% since 1967 from $114,203 to $191,156 in 2012. The nation s higher income households have received a growing share of a growing aggregate household income pie. In 1967 the top 5% received 17% of the income pie, compared to 22% in 2012. Just as income inequality has increased for the population as a whole, disparities within each racial/ethnic group have also widened over the past few decades. For example, in 2012, the richest 5% of black households (those with incomes of at least $134,883) received 22% of aggregate black household income, up from 17% in 1972. The share of income of the top 5% of white and Hispanic households have shown similar increases from 1972 to 2012.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 76% in France say they have a favorable view of Muslims living in their country, similar to the 72% registered in 2014. Meanwhile, the percentage with a very favorable opinion of Muslims has increased significantly, rising from 14% last year to 25% today

By July, though, the public had grown weary of the amount of coverage. Although about half (49%) said news organizations were giving the story the right amount of coverage and 18% said there was too little, 31% at that point said it was too much coverage, up from 14% two months earlier. 5While support for offshore drilling has largely rebounded, many Americans also support investments in alternative energy. By a two-to-one ratio, a greater share of the public favors developing alternatives like wind, solar and hydrogen over expanding ventures into oil, coal and natural gas (60% vs. 30%). In fact, the public takes something of an all-of-the-above approach to energy: 81% support better fuel-efficiency requirements and 58% want more mining and drilling on federal land. An additional 41% would favor the government promoting the increased use of nuclear power.
Across 10 measures that Pew Research Center has tracked on the same surveys since 1994, the average partisan gap has increased from 15 percentage points to 36 points
One-in Three Americans (34%) paid very close attention to news about the presidential campaign and roughly the same proportion (32%) listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. Republicans and Democrats followed campaign news equally closely last week. Coverage of the campaign well surpassed all other major stories. Campaign coverage accounted for 39% of the newshole and was particularly dominant on cable news television, where the campaign made up three-quarters (73%) of all news
Nine-in-ten or more name these as very big problems facing their nation. Half or more of Pakistanis rate 11 of the 16 issues included on the survey as very big problems
Nationally, workers appear to be in shortest supply in two service sectors: professional/business services and healthcare/social assistance. Both had well over 1 million job openings in April roughly one-third more than the sector with the third-highest number, accommodation and food services. All three of those sectors had openings rates of 5% or higher, as did the catchall other services sector. The lowest openings rate (1.7%) was in state and local public education, which historically has either the lowest or among the lowest rates of any sector. However, the sector with the fewest estimated openings in April was mining and logging, with just 22,000 job openings nationwide. Note: This is an update of a post originally published June 2, 2017.
Voters who cast their ballots for President-elect Joe Biden are much more hopeful than Biden supporters were in June: 72% now say they are hopeful about the country, compared with 42% then
Most retail sectors participate in the pre-holiday hiring surge, though some more so than others. Grocery stores and drugstores, for example, have little or no wintertime seasonality; building-material and garden-supply stores hit their peak payrolls in summer, coinciding with construction season. While the pre-holiday hiring surge is impressive, the post-holiday drop is even more dramatic. Retail payrolls typically fall 5% to 6% between December and February, as retailers with disappointing holiday sales lay off staff and close unprofitable stores. (This past year, retailers shed a combined 880,000 jobs in the two months after Christmas.) For some struggling retailers, a bad holiday season can be the final push over the ledge: Circuit City announced in January 2009 it was closing down; Borders filed for bankruptcy in February 2011.
fewer than half of Americans (44%) think the government should provide subsidies to help lower-income Americans pay for high-speed internet at home. A larger share (54%) says high-speed home internet service is affordable enough that nearly every household should be able to buy service on its own

Smaller shares of black Americans think race and racial issues get too much attention in the country (22%) or that they get the right amount (17%). Among white Americans, who are less likely to find the issue very important to their vote in 2016, 41% think race is given too much attention in the U.S., and fewer (28%) say it gets paid the right amount of attention. White Republicans are especially likely to say the issue of race is paid too much attention in this country today: Roughly six-in-ten (59%) think this is the case; 11% think it s paid too little attention, and 26% think it s given the right amount. By comparison, about half of white Democrats (49%) think racial issues are given too little attention in the country, compared with 28% who say they are given the right amount and 21% who say they are given too much attention.
The National Survey of Latinos 2008, Economics and Politics, focuses on Hispanic adults views of the state of the economy, their own personal finances and housing market conditions. It also asks about the sending of remittances in the past year and how Latinos have changed their economic behaviors in the economic downturn. The survey was conducted from November 11 through November 30, 2008, among a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1,540 Hispanic adults. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.0 percentage points. The terms Latino and Hispanic are used interchangeably in this report, as are the terms foreign born and immigrant. The terms general population and general public are used interchangeably in this report to refer to the entire U.S. adult population, including Hispanics.

By 68% to 30%, the public in July backed offering unauthorized immigrants an opportunity to gain legal status (though not necessarily citizenship) if they meet certain requirements, though support has declined some since February, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey (Pew Research Center, 2014b). Pew Research Center surveys have found that a strong majority of Hispanics and Asian Americans want to see immigration reform passed and support creating a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. However, both Hispanics and Asian Americans believe it is more important for unauthorized immigrants to get relief from the threat of deportation (Lopez, Taylor, Funk and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2013).
Some 38% of adult cell owners reported using their mobile device to keep themselves occupied during commercials or other breaks in a program they were watching within the last 30 days

In 2016, 14% of civilian workers had access to paid family leave
Most Americans (61%) say people are too quick to undergo cosmetic procedures in order to change their appearance in ways that are not really important, while a minority 36% says it s understandable that more people undergo cosmetic procedures these days because it is a competitive world and people who look more attractive tend to have an advantage. When it comes to views about elective cosmetic surgery, in particular, 34% say this is taking technology too far while 62% consider cosmetic surgery to be an appropriate use of technology. Overall, 54% of U.S. adults say elective cosmetic surgery leads to about equal benefits and downsides for society, while 26% express the belief that there are more downsides than benefits. Just 16% say there are more benefits than downsides for society from cosmetic surgery.

a poll conducted from May to June 2008 by the Venezuelan polling firm Alfredo Keller y Asociados (AKSA) indicated that 47% had a positive opinion of Chavez, down from 59% one year earlier and 64% in 2006. With the referendum less than a week away, recent polls suggest that there may be a close vote on the constitutional amendment. The Economist reported in its Feb. 5 issue that reputable opinion polls show the referendum passing by a small margin.1 However, other recent polls show that the referendum will fail to pass indicating that it may soon be the end of the road for the Venezuelan president.
About a quarter (27%) say they followed coverage of the solemn 9/11 anniversary more closely than any other news. Nearly as many (23%) say they followed news about the economy most closely. Another 13% cite President Obama s speech to Congress to unveil his jobs plan as their top story
Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are now 21 points more likely than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents to express confidence in Putin (31% vs. 10%), the widest partisan gap on this question in Pew Research Center polling. Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.
Millennials also are approaching the Boomers in their share of the American electorate
Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure in U.S. politics. In a survey conducted this spring, Democrats give her an average rating of 73 on a 0-to-100 feeling thermometer, where 100 is the warmest, most positive rating and zero the coldest, most negative. Republicans, on the other hand, give her an average rating of 12, and 59% give her a zero on the scale. Republicans deeply negative views of Clinton find a parallel in Democrats deeply negative views of Donald Trump, who rates an average of 11 on the scale, with about two-thirds of Democrats giving him a zero rating.
Overall, 62% of postgraduates say that using military force against countries that may seriously threaten but have not attacked the U.S. can rarely or never be justified; fewer (37%) say it can sometimes or often be justified. By contrast, those with lower levels of education are more likely to say pre-emptive force can sometimes or often be justified: About half of those with a college degree or less education say this. Note: See full topline results and methodology here.

By about two-to-one, Republicans who think Congress has accomplished less say this is more because they think Congress has done the wrong things than because it has not done enough (36% vs. 15%). By contrast, most Democrats who say this Congress has accomplished less than usual say it is more because it has not done enough (18%) rather than because it has done the wrong things (5%). Independents are about equally likely to say that Congress has accomplished less than usual (38%) as to say congressional accomplishments are about the same as usual (40%); 18% say Congress has accomplished more than usual. Those who say Congress has accomplished less are divided in their assessment of why (19% of independents say it is because Congress has done the wrong things, 16% say it is because Congress has not done enough).

Among those under age 35, many of them French by birth, only 40% self-identify primarily as French while 51% self-identify first as Muslim, while 7% say both equally. Among those 35 and older, 45% self-identify with their nationality, 36% as Muslims and 16% as both equally. However, no such age differential appears on the question of whether Muslims in France want either to be distinct from the larger culture or to adopt its customs. Nearly eight-in-ten French Muslims (78%) say they want to adopt French customs. Those under age 35 are equally as likely to say this as are their elders. This high preference for assimilation compares with that expressed by 53% of Muslims in Spain, 41% in Britain and 30% in Germany. All in all, one might conclude that, despite their problems prime among them joblessness among youth generally, not just Muslim youth the French need take no integrationist lessons from their European neighbors.
Fully 45% followed economic news very closely, while 17% say this was the story they followed more closely than any other

So it seems likely that in the near future the youngest adults will be members of a post-Millennial generation. Historical and demographic markers will factor into determining the dividing line between Millennials and post-Millennials. But it is unlikely that any single indicator or an aha moment will mark the end of the Millennial generation, absent some unexpected event. More likely is that an end-point definition will emerge over time as debate among researchers and usage in popular culture forms a working definition. As with Generation X and its original Baby Bust label, there may be different names attached to the post-Millennial generation before one eventually sticks. Regardless of where and when the line is drawn to end the Millennial generation, it will take several years before enough post-Millennials have reached adulthood to allow for meaningful statements about the next adult generation. One thing is clear: the next generation, today s children and teens, will likely be shaped by very different influences and forces than the generations that preceded it.
Slightly more than a quarter (27%) say they heard a lot last week about CBS correspondent Lara Logan being attacked while covering events in Egypt. Another 42% say they heard a little about this, while 31% say they heard nothing at all

Among current House members of both parties, about three-in-ten are Catholic (32%) a share that has remained fairly steady over the last four Congresses. Catholics remain the second-largest religious group in the House, after Protestants (58%). The Senate, which elects members to six-year terms, has seen little change in the total number or the party affiliation of Catholics in recent Congresses. About a fifth of Senate Republicans were Catholic in 2009 and similar share are Catholic today. Note: Due to the resignation of Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.), this analysis includes one fewer Catholic Republican in the House compared with our initial report on the religious affiliation of the 114th Congress.
In identifying how candidates made their announcements, we looked for the public event billed as the formal announcement by either the campaign or by reporters covering the campaign. If no announcement was made at or around the time the candidate formally filed their papers with the Federal Election Commission, the announcement of an exploratory committee was used, though this applied to only three candidates. If a candidate made statements in several venues at or around the same time, these were all considered as campaign announcements. If there was no statement made to the public, a statement made to the media was used.
A large majority of tweets come from a small minority of users. The median Twitter user produces two tweets per month, according to a 2019 study.

The Turkish public again is somewhat less worried than its neighbors about events in Syria: only about half (49%) worry that extremists will emerge victorious from the battle with Bashar al-Assad s government. In recent days, of course, global attention has focused on the ISIS s battlefield success in Iraq, with the U.S. and other governments weighing political and military options. When the conflict was confined to Syria, many nations, including the U.S., had been reluctant to become involved militarily. People in the Middle East may wonder at any distinction between unrest in Syria and Iraq, as many had long anticipated that Syria s violence would spread to neighboring states.

In both cases, these shares were the highest out of the 11 emerging economies surveyed by the Center in 2019. While Nigerians who live close to the Chinese railway project expressed more positive attitudes toward China after the project was completed, there was no consistent relationship between people s distance to the project and other China-related questions in the Center s survey, such as views toward China s growing economy, its increasingly powerful military or Chinese President Xi Jinping.

at 5% Donald Trump registers the lowest confidence rating of any U.S. leader in Mexico since Pew Research Center began surveying there. This 5% rating is also the lowest among the 37 nations polled in 2017. The proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high-profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president, and more than nine-in-ten Mexicans oppose it. U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico. That remains the case this year, although the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015. Trump receives dramatically lower ratings than his predecessor in Canada. And for the first time since the Center began polling in Canada, the share of Canadians expressing a favorable opinion of their neighbor to the south has slipped to below 50%. Just 43% of Canadians now have a positive view of the U.S.

More than eight-in-ten churchgoing Christians say their primary church offers streaming or recorded services online or on TV, including roughly nine-in-ten evangelical (92%) and mainline Protestants (86%) who say this. Most Catholics (79%) and Protestants in the historically black tradition (73%) also say their churches are making religious services available remotely. A Pew Research Center survey conducted last month found that 57% of adults who attend religious services at least monthly said they have watched religious services online or on TV because of the coronavirus outbreak. Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.
In the United States, 65% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents give the EU a positive rating, compared with just 39% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.

Among those who say almost everyone in their family shares their political views (22% of the public), an overwhelming share (82%) says their family is comfortable talking about politics. Yet the share of adults who say their family is OK with political discussions decreases among those who say there is less agreement in their family on politics. About two-thirds of those of who say most of their family members share their political views (65%) say their family is OK with talking about politics; that s 17 percentage points lower than among those who say almost everyone agrees with their views. Around four-in-ten (42%) of those who say a few members share their political views say their family is OK with discussing politics but that share falls to just 28% among those who say almost no one in their family shares their views on politics. Note: See full topline results and methodology here (PDF).
The share of Republicans who say the deficit affects their finances a lot has declined by about half since 2011, from 48% to 23%. About one-in-five Democrats (22%) also say the deficit has a big financial impact, down from 38% seven years ago

more than 30% of student-loan borrowers who moved into their repayment cycles were delinquent (that is, they re 90 days or more behind in their payments), up from 20% just eight years earlier. That effective delinquency rate, which excludes people who aren t yet on the hook to start repaying their loans, has risen among all age groups but is highest among borrowers younger than 30: 35% of that subgroup was delinquent in 2012
Roughly two-thirds of the politically unaffiliated those who do not feel close to any party are also most likely to identify as just Taiwanese, while about three-in-ten consider themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese. Those who identify with the KMT are more likely to say they are both Taiwanese and Chinese than just Taiwanese. Still, about a third of this group identifies as only Taiwanese. No more than about one-in-ten in each political group see themselves as only Chinese.

Half of Americans say that their European allies should keep national defense spending at current levels, while 35% say these allies should increase their defense spending. Only around one-in-ten (9%) say European allies should decrease their defense spending. Germans are more divided. Around four-in-ten favor increasing their own defense budget (40%) or keeping it the same (41%), while 15% support a decrease. Since 2017, there have been shifts in both countries on this subject. Americans have become less likely to say their European allies should increase defense spending (45% said this in 2017, compared with 35% this year). Germans have become more likely to favor increased defense spending in their country (32% said this in 2017, compared with 40% this year). Note: See full topline results and methodology here.

8 Additionally, some VoIP providers do not offer 911 emergency service capability. While providers are said to be working with emergency service officials to address this problem, the ability to contact police, fire and other emergency services via the telephone is critical.
Seven-in-ten Turks have a negative opinion of NATO, whose members include most EU countries as well as the U.S. and Canada. Dislike for NATO is particularly intense, with 53% of Turks saying they have a very unfavorable opinion of the treaty organization. Opinions of NATO in Turkey have been consistently low since the question was first asked in 2011, although very unfavorable opinions are up 21 points from last year.
Just 39% in Greece expressed positive views of the U.S., among the lowest measured in the spring 39-nation survey. Only publics in Turkey, the Palestinian territories, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan thought worse of America. This negative impression of the U.S. coincides with less than stellar views of President Obama. Only about a third of Greeks (35%) have confidence in the American president to handle international affairs, with 62% expressing little or no confidence. The EU gets even lower ratings than the U.S. Only one-third of Greeks have a positive opinion of the EU, with 65% expressing an unfavorable opinion. Furthermore, 78% say the Greek economy has been weakened by the economic integration of Europe. However, 69% still want to keep the euro as their currency, rather than return to the drachma.

Some 43% of Americans think major technology firms support the views of liberals over conservatives, while 33% believe these companies support the views of men over women, a new Pew Research Center survey finds. In addition, 72% of the public thinks it likely that social media platforms actively censor political views that those companies find objectionable. The belief that technology companies are politically biased and/or engaged in suppression of political speech is especially widespread among Republicans. Fully 85% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think it likely that social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints, with 54% saying this is very likely. And a majority of Republicans (64%) think major technology companies as a whole support the views of liberals over conservatives

Twitterers are less likely to read a printed copy of a newspaper, but more likely to read a newspaper online, and more likely to read a news story on a cell phone or on a smart phone. A similar pattern holds for video news consumption; on any given day, Twitter users are just as likely as others to watch news on a TV, and just as likely to watch video news on a computer, but more likely to watch a news video on a cell phone or on a smart phone.
The press receives lower ratings for its coverage of Iraq from those who were following that story closely 13% rate the coverage excellent, 37% say it s been good. Reports about sub-par conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center receive similar ratings from those following the story closely 10% excellent, 39% good. The public also gives the press higher grades for its Smith coverage than for its reporting on the 2008 presidential campaign and on the mounting tensions between Iran and the U.S. Roughly half of those following each story give the press excellent or good ratings for its coverage
Nearly six-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning voters (59%) say they have an excellent or good impression of their party s hopefuls, according to a September survey. In August 2011, half (49%) of Republican voters viewed the GOP presidential field positively

From 2015 to 2019, the nation s Hispanic population grew by an average of 1.9% per year similar to the 2.1% annual growth between 2010 and 2015, but down from annual growth of more than 3% in earlier years
Nearly nine-in-ten (86%) approve of his performance, including 76% who strongly approve. Yet those who say economic conditions are good are not nearly as supportive of Trump. Half of this group approves of his job performance, with only about a third (36%) strongly approving. In part, this reflects partisanship in views of both the economy and Trump. For instance, among Republicans who view the economy as good (half of all Republicans and leaners), 82% approve of Trump s job performance. But among the roughly one third of Democrats who give the economy the same rating, only 11% approve of Trump s performance. Among the 15% of Republicans who rate conditions as only fair, a narrow majority (55%) approves of his job performance. Among Democrats who view the economy as only fair, just 4% approve of the job Trump is doing.

Public interest in news about candidates for the 2004 presidential election has declined a bit since earlier this year. Fewer than three-in-ten (28%) say they are following campaign news very closely, down from 31% in April and 35% in mid-March. Nonetheless, interest is higher now than at a similar stage in the presidential campaigns of four and eight years ago; in June 2000, 23% were following the election very closely and about the same number did so in July 1996 (22%).
In the eyes of most people surveyed around the world, the White House s new occupant is arrogant, intolerant and even dangerous. Among the positive characteristics tested, his highest rating is for being a strong leader. Fewer believe he is charismatic, well-qualified or cares about ordinary people
Turnout among Millennials was higher in 2016 51%. But again, that s significantly lower than the 61% of the electorate who voted. In order for their voting clout to match their share of the electorate, roughly 61% of Millennials would have to have turned out to vote in 2016. While it may be a slam-dunk that Millennials will soon be the largest generation in the electorate, it will likely be a much longer time before they are the largest bloc of voters. Note: This post was originally published on May 16, 2016, under the headline Millennials match Baby Boomers as largest generation in U.S. electorate, but will they vote? which reflected the Center s definition of Millennials at the time (born between 1981 and 1998). This updated version reflects the Center s newly revised definition, under which Millennial births end in 1996.
Overall, 43% of Republican college graduates offer a warm rating of professors, while about as many (40%) rate them coldly. By 45% to 26%, more Republicans without a college degree express a cold than warm view of professors. Among Democrats, views are especially positive among postgraduates and college graduates. For example, 93% of Democrats with postgraduate degrees rate professors warmly, including 72% who rate them very warmly. About half (49%) of Democrats with a high school degree or less education rate professors warmly on the scale; just 11% offer a cold rating, while 34% are neutral. Some of the coldest views of professors are held by older Republicans. Among Republicans age 65 and older, fully 64% have a cold view of professors (including 43% who have a very cold view), while just 15% offer a warm rating. Among Republicans under age 40, by contrast, more rate college professors warmly (47%) than coldly (27%).

Young voters are significantly less engaged in this year s election than at a comparable point in 2008 and now lag far behind older voters in interest in the campaign and intention to vote. The share of voters younger than 30 who are following campaign news very closely is roughly half what it was at this point four years ago (18%, down from 35%). Just 63% of young registered voters say they definitely plan to vote this year, down from 72% four years ago

Among Republicans, just 21% of conservatives say it is the federal government s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. Moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided in their views (46% say it is the federal government s responsibility, 52% say it is not). Among Democrats, support for a single national government program is 19 percentage points higher among liberals (59%) than conservatives and moderates (40%). Still, wide majorities in both groups say ensuring all Americans have health care coverage is the government s responsibility (91% among liberal Democrats, 80% among conservative and moderate Democrats). Note: See full topline results (PDF) and methodology here. This is an update of a post originally published June 23, 2017.
In 1980, only 13% of married women earned more than or about as much as their husbands. By 2000, the share had risen to 25%. Today, 31% of women who are married or cohabiting are contributing at least half of the couple s total earnings (including 28% who earn more than their husband or partner and 3% who earn about the same amount). In 69% of married or cohabiting couples, the man earns more than the woman, though this is down from 87% of married couples in 1980
Some 65% of the smartphone-only Americans say the smartphone lets them do all they need to online, according to our 2015 survey. But while the smartphone-only clearly see the usefulness of the device, cost plays an important role in the decision not to subscribe to high-speed service at home. The availability of other access options outside the home also comes prominently into play. Public libraries may help fill the online gap among smartphone users who don t subscribe to home broadband services. For public library users, those with smartphones only are somewhat more likely than those with home broadband, by a 34% to 30% margin, to use a library s Wi-Fi, computers or internet connections to get online. Similarly, for those who engage in personal learning activities, the smartphone-only are more likely to do this at a high school, college or community college than those with broadband at home (by a 40% to 24% margin).
partisans largely agree on what they are looking forward to. The Olympics and Super Bowl are high on both parties lists, while the World Cup ranks much lower; roughly equal shares are looking forward to this summer s international soccer tournament (22% overall). However, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they are especially looking forward to the Academy Awards (36% vs. 20%). With coverage under the 2010 health care law going into effect Jan. 1, 30% of adults closely followed news about the rollout last week. About three-in-ten (29%) closely followed news about the economy. Other news stories last week garnered less interest. Fewer than two-in-ten (16%) closely followed news about recreational marijuana shops that opened legally in Colorado, while 13% followed news about a research ship that was trapped in ice off Antarctica. About one-in-ten (11%) followed either violence in Syria or the two terrorist bombings that struck Russia.

By relatively wide margins, black Americans are more likely than whites to say they see strong or very strong conflicts between the two racial groups (70% vs. 47%) and between the rich and poor (74% vs. 56%). Similarly, black Americans (51%) are somewhat more likely than whites (38%) to say these conflicts exist between young and older people. These differences are much less pronounced when accounting for partisanship for instance, 73% of black Democrats and 66% of white Democrats say there are strong or very strong conflicts between white and black people. Adults under the age of 30 are somewhat more likely to report strong or very strong conflicts between older and younger people 51% say this, compared with about four-in-ten of those in older age groups. Note: Here are the questions asked for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.

Just 10% of Latinos say priority should be given to better border security and enforcement, compared with 29% of the general public
Majorities in every country surveyed say they disapprove of how the EU is handling refugees, including a staggering 94% of Greeks and 88% of Swedes. Disapproval of the EU s handling of the refugee crisis is high among all segments of society across Europe. But discontentment is especially high among people with favorable views of the anti-immigrant parties in Britain (UK Independence Party), Germany (Alternative for Germany) and the Netherlands (Party for Freedom). NOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here. For updated demographic figures for the Netherlands, please contact info@pewresearch.org.

This is the reason why, in the graphics that you see in our report, we group sources in broad categories such as Sources Trusted by more than 50% of Panelists and Sources More Trusted than Distrusted. For example, The Guardian, Bloomberg and The New Yorker sit next to each other in the more trusted than distrusted section of the adjacent chart. Statistically, their ratios of trust over distrust are equivalent (1.7, 1.4 and 1.4, respectively).
among Millennials with a high school education, 70% of men and 69% of women had been with their employer at least 13 months. These proportions are similar to their high-school-educated counterparts among today s Gen Xers in 2000 (72% for men and 71% for women).

Even smaller shares of mobile phone owners use the devices to access a social networking site (9%) or to get political news and information (8%). These figures are well below the median percentages that we found in other emerging and developing countries. Still, the technology market in India is booming as the country becomes more of a regional and global economic player. Assuming the Indian economy continues to grow over time, technology companies will have an increasing number of Indian consumers. And it is likely that these technologies will become more integrated into the vast democratic process of an Indian election. Pew Research Center survey on technology usage in India was conducted between December 7, 2013, and January 12, 2014 (for more details, see the methodology from Indians Reflect on Their Country & the World, released March 31, 2014). Here are the topline results and survey methodology.

Young people are much more optimistic today: fully 62% believe they will gain influence under Obama, while just 15% say they will lose influence. Wealthy people ranked near the top of the list of self-described winners under Bush, but they take a more measured view of their futures under Obama. By nearly three-to-one (41% to 14%), people with annual family incomes of $100,00 or more said that people like themselves would gain rather than lose influence under Bush. By a smaller margin (31% to 23%), more people with incomes of at least $100,000 say they will gain, not lose, influence under Obama. 1.

In December, 53% approved and 39% disapproved. Obama s current rating among independents is only slightly higher than Bush s in November 2005 (29% approved). Like Bush, Obama retains broad support among members of his own party, though the share of Democrats who give him a positive jobs rating has fallen 10 points over the past year (from 88% to 78%). Obama s job rating among Republicans, extremely low last December (12%), has changed little since then.
The public s policy agenda is again dominated by the economy and jobs with other major issues viewed as less important.

Among Republicans, there are large divisions in views of whether the government should do more to help those in need by household income. While majorities of Republicans in upper-income (76%) and middle-income (68%) households say the government cannot afford to do more to help those in need, lower-income Republicans are divided: 50% say the government can t afford to do more to help the needy, while 47% say the government should do more. There are minimal differences in these views by household income among Democrats.

People who favor gun rights are also about twice as likely as gun control supporters to have contacted a public official about gun policy (15% vs. 8%). By contrast, comparable percentages of gun rights supporters (19%) and those who prioritize gun control (15%) say they have expressed their opinion about gun policy on social networks. And about one-in-ten in each group says they have signed a petition on gun policy (12% of gun rights supporters, 10% of gun control supporters).

About six-in-ten (61%) Republican and GOP-leaning registered voters think their party will do better than in recent elections roughly double the share of Democrats (32%) who feel similarly about their party s chances. This gap has not reached the same levels of the GOP s margin before their large 2010 gains or the Democrats expectations in their 2006 sweep of both houses of Congress. Last December, the expectations gap was narrower; 55% of Republicans and Republican-leaning registered voters said the party would do better than recent elections, compared with 43% of Democrats. A plurality of Democrats (48%) believe their party will do about the same as past elections while 14% think the outcome will be worse.

Far more conservative and moderate Democrats say a friend voting for Trump would not have any effect (73%) than say it would put a strain on the friendship (25%)
Clinton s approval rating was a solid 62%. Helped by a strong economy, Clinton finished out his presidency at about the same high level of approval, while Bush sunk even further, ending his term as the 2008 financial crisis was underway. Obama, at this point, is hovering somewhere in between them with his future trajectory yet to be determined. Another measure of what impact the standings of Obama and Bush might have on the midterms is the extent to which voters say their decisions are meant to be a vote for or against the sitting president. At this point in 2006, 34% of voters regarded their midterm vote as opposition to Bush while 17% said it was a sign of support. This year, 26% of voters see their vote as one against Obama while 16% say their vote is meant to support him.

Putin gets his highest marks on managing relations with China (78% approval), a country with which Russian relations have become markedly friendlier in recent years. However, even that figure is down 12 percentage points compared with 2015.

Some 37% of Salvadorans are Protestant, and among all Salvadorans, only 5% are mainline Protestants and 32% are evangelical Protestants. Some 15% of Salvadoran adults are religiously unaffiliated
Critics have argued that any poll based on registered voters is likely to be biased toward Democratic candidates, since likely voter screens tend to reduce the proportion of Democratic supporters relative to Republican supporters. This has been the case in Pew Research s final election polls over the past four presidential elections. In these polls the vote margin has been, on average, five points more favorable to the Republican candidates when based on likely voters rather than registered voters. These final estimates of the outcome have generally been very accurate, especially when undecided respondents are allocated to the candidates. Yet the effect of limiting the analysis to likely voters can vary over the course of the campaign cycle, even in just the later months. For example, in September and October of 2008, most Pew Research surveys found little difference between election estimates based on all registered voters and those we identified as most likely to vote, suggesting again that determining a likely voter gets more accurate only as Election Day nears.
More than half of married couples in the United States say sharing household chores is very important to a successful marriage. But when it comes to grocery shopping and cooking, women tend to say they re the ones usually doing the work
More than eight-in-ten (83%) say the U.S. takes the interests of countries like India into account when it makes foreign policy decisions the highest percentage among the 21 nations surveyed outside the U.S. This view has become increasingly common among Indians over the last eight years in 2002, only 51% said the U.S. considered their interests

The same is true for just 10% of non-owners, including 6% who have done so in the past year.
In 2014, 54% of American Catholics gave Francis excellent or good marks for his handling of the church s sex abuse scandal. But in a Pew Research Center poll conducted in September 2018 shortly after recent reports about sex scandals in the U.S. Catholic Church the share of Catholics saying this had fallen 23 points, to 31%. The recent survey also found that the pontiff s overall approval rating among U.S. Catholics had dropped to 72%, down from 84% in January of this year. Note: This is an update of a post originally published Sept. 4, 2018.
About a quarter (26%) of the public says they very closely followed news about vandalism and threats directed at Democrats following the health care reform vote; 5% say this was the story they followed most closely.

a median of 26% expect the war in Syria to end in the next year, 32% expect it to end in the next five years and 29% think it will continue for more than five years
The U.S. per capita trade imbalance with both China and Germany has deepened since 2009, but Germany s has done so faster. This growing competition from high-value-added products from Germany may be no less challenging in its own way than the competition posed by the far more numerous lower-value-added goods from China. And as China s exports of high-value products to the U.S. increases General Motors now intends to sell Chinese-made Buick SUVs in the U.S. in 2016, for example the U.S. per capita trade imbalance with China may widen.
In December, the company reported, 945 million monthly active users worldwide accessed Facebook via a mobile application or a mobile version of the site, up 39% from December 2012. Of those 945 million, nearly a third (296 million) were mobile-only users.
In the survey, conducted in March and April during the presidential primaries, just 27% of drop-off voters said they were following the 2016 election very closely, compared with 49% of consistent voters.

In Sweden, just 8% of those surveyed scored higher than 5, the lowest amount in any country, while in Italy, 38% did, the highest share in any country. In most countries, the share scoring 5.01 or higher was between 15% and 25%. For example, in both Norway and France, 19% of respondents scored 5.01 or higher. The NIM scale also provides an opportunity to explore whether factors such as age, political ideology or religious affiliation are associated with these kinds of attitudes. The analysis finds that: While younger people tend to score lower on the NIM, statistical analysis suggests that, in Western Europe overall, this has less to do with their age and more to do with factors like religion and familiarity with Muslims. For example, younger Western Europeans are more likely to say they personally know a Muslim and to say they are religiously unaffiliated; both of these factors are closely associated with lower NIM scores.
57% have contacted an elected official in the last year, while 38% have made a political donation and 34% have attended a rally.

Currently, 65% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, while 30% say they are hearing mostly bad news and just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news
Over the past two decades, the share of students graduating from public high schools who are white and non-Hispanic has declined dramatically from 73% in 1995 to 57% in 2012, according to the most recent data available. In that time period the shares that are Hispanic and Asian have grown. WICHE projects that this trend will continue, with the public high school graduating class of 2025 being barely majority white (51%). Young Hispanics will likely make up a larger share of high school graduates a decade from now, but today they are also the least likely among the major racial and ethnic groups to pursue full-time college enrollment. Another unknown factor for higher education is cost: Tuition has been rising rapidly at public and private universities, and the share of high school graduates in the class of 2025 who elect to pursue college full-time will also depend on how affordable college is and whether students and their families decide college is valuable.
Nearly half (49%) think the U.S. plays a less important leadership role today than it did 10 years ago, up from 29% who said this in 2016. Three-in-ten Democrats say the U.S. global leadership role is about as important as it was 10 years ago and 19% think it is more important; both shares are somewhat lower than they were in 2016

Nearly seven-in-ten men (68%) approve of the U.S. missile strikes in response to the reported use of chemical weapons, compared with 48% of women. And while majorities of both men and women say Trump lacks a clear plan for Syria, women are more likely to express this view (65% of women vs. 57% of men). Adults under 30 are the only age group in which more people disapprove (56%) than approve (39%) of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Majorities in older age groups approve of the U.S. military action. Younger people (those under 50) also are more likely than those 50 and older to say that Trump does not have a clear plan for dealing with the situation in Syria.
More than seven-in-ten Chinese citizens (72%) express satisfaction with their national condition, while fewer than one-in-five (19%) are dissatisfied. These figures represent a sharp improvement from 2002, when only 48% said they were satisfied with their country while 33% were not. On this score, China far outstrips India, where only 41% say they are content with national conditions. And in China, the level of satisfaction is more than three times higher than in Russia, where only 23% are pleased with their country s direction. In short, China s citizens, unlike those in Russia but much like those in India, are clearly upbeat about the growing opportunities in their rapidly modernizing society. Business Week recently noted that China s economy has expanded by 9.5% a year over the last two decades. The Chinese appear confident that these gains will continue and that they will feel the effects of continued growth in their own lives.
7Americans have low trust in information from social media. Just 5% of web-using U.S. adults have a lot of trust in the information they get from social media, nearly identical to the 4% who said so in 2016. This level of trust is much lower than trust in national and local news organizations, and in information coming from friends and family

While just one-third of Turks have confidence that President Obama will do the right thing in world affairs, this is a significant increase from 2008, when only 2% voiced confidence in then-President Bush. And while most Turks continue to oppose U.S.-led anti-terrorism efforts and most still believe the U.S. could be a military threat to their country some day, these views are less common than they were in the waning years of the Bush administration. As the survey reveals, the U.S. is not the only major power receiving negative reviews in Turkey China, Russia and the European Union also get poor ratings. Turkish views of the U.S. have not always been so downbeat. U.S. State Department polling from the beginning of this decade found just over half (52%) of Turks expressing a favorable opinion of the U.S.
4New Zealand had low levels of social hostilities involving religion in 2016 (with a Social Hostilities Index score of 0.9 out of 10). There have been incidents of religiously motivated violence and hostilities in the past, although these cases have been relatively rare. In September 2016, for example, the Whanganui branch of the Right Wing Resistance, a right wing organization, circulated pamphlets that accused Muslim refugees in the country of intending to change the culture of New Zealand to suit themselves and to kill anyone who did not believe in God.
A plurality also says that scientists are neutral toward religion (42%), while 35% say scientists are unfriendly and just 12% view scientists as friendly toward religion. Political and religious differences are somewhat less stark, but still apparent, in views of how friendly the media and scientists are toward religion. Pluralities of independents and Democrats say the media and scientists are neutral to religion. But majorities of Republicans (51%) and white evangelical Protestants (52%) in the survey say the news media are unfriendly toward religion. And almost half of weekly worship attenders say the media are unfriendly toward religion (46%), compared with 29% among those who attend religious services less often. Republicans, evangelicals, black Protestants and weekly churchgoers also stand out compared with other groups for viewing scientists as unfriendly toward religion.
Only about half of all registered voters (48%) want to see their own representative reelected and just half as many (24%) would like to see most members of Congress reelected. These also are close to two-decade lows in Pew Research Center surveys. Yet unlike in the previous two midterms, anti-incumbent sentiment is shared fairly equally among both Democratic and Republican voters. Today, 38% of those who support the GOP candidate in their district say their own representative does not deserve reelection; nearly as many Democrats (34%) share that view

Teenage girls use social media sites and platforms particularly visually-oriented ones for sharing more than their male counterparts do. For their part, boys are more likely than girls to own gaming consoles and play video games. Data for this report was collected for Pew Research Center. The survey was administered online by the GfK Group using its KnowledgePanel, in English and Spanish, to a nationally representative sample of over 1,060 teens ages 13 to 17 and a parent or guardian from September 25 to October 9, 2014 and February 10 to March 16, 2015. In the fall, 1016 parent-teen pairs were interviewed. The survey was re-opened in the spring and 44 pairs were added to the sample. For more on the methods for this study, please visit the Methods section at the end of this report.

In response to these concerns, a group of senators recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to open an investigation into the home-sharing industry. And just this week, Airbnb hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to develop an anti-discrimination policy for the platform. Blacks overall make significantly less use of the range of 11 shared or on-demand online services that the Center studied in its survey.

In the six months studied the biggest news event by far that referenced Hispanics was the nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latino to serve on the high court. More than a third of all the coverage that dealt with Hispanic people or issues was about Sotomayor s nomination. Immigration, which from 2006 through 2008 had been heavily debated in Congress and on the political campaign trail, was the subject of fewer than one in ten stories involving Latinos, a reflection of the degree to which the issue largely fell off the radar during the early months of the Obama Administration. These are some of the central findings of a study that examined coverage of four prominent ethnic, racial and religious groups Asians, Africans/African-Americans, Hispanics and Muslims in 55 U.S. news outlets, including 13 newspapers, 15 cable programs, the 7 broadcast network evening and morning news programs, 12 prominent news websites and 9 news radio and talk programs.

Among the bill s supporters, 52% have a favorable view of the Supreme Court, while 34% view it unfavorably. Among the bill s opponents, the balance is only slightly less negative; 55% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

Nearly nine-in-ten respondents (89%) correctly answered that this is not allowed.

The 2008 National Survey of Latinos focuses on Hispanic registered voters views on the presidential candidates, the presidential campaign and Hispanic political participation. The survey was conducted from June 9 through July 13, 2008 among a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 2,015 Hispanic adults, 892 of whom report that they are U.S. citizens and registered to vote. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points; for registered voters, 4.4 percentage points. The terms Latino and Hispanic are used interchangeably in this report, as are the terms foreign born and immigrant. The terms whites, blacks and Asians are used to refer to the non-Hispanic components of their population.

While that is only somewhat higher than a year earlier (19%), it is the highest share dating back to 2000. At that time, just 12% of the public described themselves as both liberal and as Democrats or Democratic leaners. There has been little change since 2000 in other partisan and ideological categories, although the share saying they do not lean to either party is smaller today (11%) than in the early 2000s (17% in 2000). Millennials were most likely to identify as liberal Democrats. In 2016, a majority of Millennials (55%) identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic; 27% described themselves as liberal Democrats the highest share of any generation

Although a solid majority of Americans believe the evidence of global warming is real, concern about it seems to have lessened over time. In a Pew Research survey from June 2006, about three-quarters of Americans said global warming was either a very serious (41%) or somewhat serious (33%) problem. But in the most recent survey, only 33% of Americans called global warming a very serious problem, and 32% said it was somewhat serious. Meanwhile, the percentage saying it was not a problem at all nearly doubled, from 11% in June 2006 to 20% in the most recent survey. Last year, 19% said it was not a problem at all. In partisan terms, almost twice as many Democrats (87%) as Republicans (44%) say there s solid evidence that the earth s average temperature has been rising, and Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to say that global warming is mainly caused by human activity (57% vs. 19%).

Not only does the face of multiracial America appear to be transforming across generations, but the prevalence of mixed-race Americans is changing as well. One-in-ten babies living with two parents were multiracial in 2013, up from just 1% in 1970, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of census data. Rapid increases in mixed-race marriages have likely fueled much of the rise in the share of multiracial babies in the past several decades. Since just 1980, the share of marriages between spouses of different races has almost quadrupled, up to 6%, a new Pew Research study on multiracial Americans has found. At the same time, though, a large share of mixed-race babies (43%) are not living with a married parent, suggesting that it s probably not just interracial marriage, but interracial dating in general that is driving the demographic change.
About 65% of the total black population was eligible to vote in November 2006. About 1.3 million adult blacks were not eligible to vote because they were not U.S. citizens. The black electorate in many ways reflects the characteristics of the wider adult black population (Table 7). But as was the case among whites, there were some differences between black voters and all black adults. In November 2006, black voters were more female, for example. About 40% of black voters reported a family income of $50,000 or more, compared to 33% among all black adults. Black voters were also more likely to have finished college (26%) than all black adults (18%).

Those living in Ukraine s East (26%) and South (19%) are somewhat more enthusiastic about the idea of reuniting Ukraine and Russia, but support falls to the single digits in the country s Center (5%) and West (1%). Similarly, a 32%-minority of Russian-speakers think the two countries should merge, compared with just 9% among Ukrainian-speakers. At least in the days leading up to Viktor Yanukovych s removal from office, events in Ukraine had yet to boost enthusiasm for a single Ukrainian-Russian state. In both countries, support for a unified state has remained relatively flat over the past six years. In 2008, 20% of Ukrainians backed such a move, compared with 12% today. In Russia, attitudes have changed even less: in 2008, 19% backed reunification vs. 16% today.

Based on the uptick in voter turnout among DotNets in 2004, their relatively high levels of civic engagement, and their willingness to express their opinions to political leaders, the media, and their peers, this cohort of Americans is not likely to be a silent generation. 1Scott Keeter, Director of Survey Research for the Pew Center for the People & the Press, is co-author of A New Engagement? Political Participation, Civic Life, and the Changing American Citizen (with Cliff Zukin, Molly Andolina, Krista Jenkins, and Michael X. Delli Carpini).

Americans overwhelmingly think that it would be too risky to give U.S. presidents more power to deal directly with many of the country s problems: 77% say this, while just 17% say that problems could be dealt with more effectively if U.S. presidents didn t have to worry so much about Congress or the courts. When a similar question was asked six months ago, a wide majority also expressed skepticism about increasing presidential power (77% now, 72% then). The sense that increasing presidential power would be too risky has grown among Democrats since August, when Barack Obama was still president: While a 66% majority said giving presidents greater powers would be too risky in August, nearly nine-in-ten (87%) now say this. Conversely, while 82% of Republicans expressed concern about increasing presidential powers relative to the other branches of government in August, a smaller majority (65%) say this today.

However, only a relatively small share of the public feels this is actually the case today. About a quarter (26%) feel that the statement people who give a lot of money to elected officials do not have more influence than others describes the country very or somewhat well; roughly seven-in-ten (72%) say this does not describe the country well, with 43% saying it describes it not at all well. Across the political spectrum, few people think that big donors do not command more influence than others
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to view each of these issues as a major threat to the well-being of the U.S.

Since 2001, the share of Americans who favor increased legal immigration into the U.S. has risen 22 percentage points (from 10% to 32%), while the share who support a decrease has declined 29 points (from 53% to 24%). The shift is mostly driven by changing views among Democrats. The share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who say legal immigration into the U.S. should be increased has doubled since 2006, from 20% to 40%. Republicans views also have changed, though more modestly. The share of Republicans and Republican leaners who say legal immigration should be decreased has fallen 10 percentage points since 2006, from 43% to 33%. Still, about twice as many Republicans (33%) as Democrats (16%) support cutting legal immigration into the U.S.

The share of 20- to 24-year-olds who were in the workforce stood at 76.4% in 2002, fell to 70.9% in 2012 and is projected to drop to 67.3% in 2022, which would be the lowest rate since 1969. A major reason for their decreasing labor force participation was an increase in school attendance at all levels thus reducing the share of those young adults participating in the workforce compared with previous generations. A Pew Research analysis in Nov. 2012 found that a record share of young adults had finished both high school and college, reflecting in part the belief that a college degree is necessary to career success as well as the degree to which younger adults decided to return to school when they couldn t find opportunities in the job market during the recession.
In September 1945, the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago asked Americans what they would have done if they had been the one to decide whether or not to use the atomic bomb against Japan.

More people higher in science knowledge perceive consensus among scientists that GM foods are safe to eat. Still, only two-in-ten (20%) of this group rate scientists as understanding very well the health risks and benefits of GM foods. These differences associated with science knowledge are in keeping with findings in the Science and Engineering Indicators and other research showing a modest positive relationship between science knowledge and general views about science and scientists. Science knowledge is not strongly connected with people s degree of concern about the issue of GM foods or their focus on eating healthy and nutritious foods.

Alan Greenspan Bernanke s predecessor was also not very well known among the public in May 2000. Among those who offered an opinion, however, views of Greenspan were quite positive: 76% had a favorable opinion. There was also no partisan difference in opinion equal shares of Republicans and leaners and Democrats and leaners (76% each) reported a favorable view of the then-chair.

Among those who voted in 2018, about 52% of Asians and 45% of Hispanics said they either voted in person before Election Day or by mail. Lower shares of white voters (39%) and black voters (33%) said the same. Overall, about 40% of voters said they cast a ballot in person before Election Day or by mail, up from 31% in 2014. Correction: In a previous version of this post, researcher Aram Hur s name was misspelled under Challenges in estimating voter turnout rates with the Current Population Survey.

Few (18%) had heard nothing at all. The media devoted 3% of the newshole to the pirate story
younger cell owners are more likely than their elders to engage with others around televised content. This is especially true for posting one s comments online and for sharing text messages with others watching the same program for each of these activities, the youngest cell owners (those ages 18-24) stand out even compared with those just a few years older
In nearly all countries polled, majorities oppose monitoring by the U.S. government of emails and phone calls of foreign leaders or their citizens. In contrast, Americans tilt toward the view that eavesdropping on foreign leaders is an acceptable practice, and they are divided over using this technique on average people in other countries. However, the majority of Americans and others around the world agree that it is acceptable to spy on suspected terrorists, and that it is unacceptable to spy on American citizens
Fully 93% of Romney supporters say they have an unfavorable opinion of Barack Obama. By comparison, in the fall of 2008 just 68% of McCain voters offered an unfavorable opinion of Obama, while 29% viewed him favorably. This pattern also is seen among Obama supporters: 84% view Romney unfavorably, compared with 70% who expressed an unfavorable opinion of McCain the fall of 2008.

Nearly three-quarters of Millennials (73%) say colleges and universities have a positive impact, compared with 64% of Generation Xers, 59% of Boomers and just 51% of Silents. And although technology companies are widely seen as having a positive impact on the country, a generation gap does exist: 77% of Millennials and nearly as many Xers (73%) and Boomers (70%) say this, compared with a smaller majority of Silents (59%). While about half of Americans (48%) view the energy industry as having a positive impact on the country, this view is somewhat more common among those in younger generations than older: 54% of Millennials and 52% of Xers say this, compared with just 42% of Boomers and 35% of Silents.

A third say the coverage has been a balance of the two. More than half (53%) of those surveyed say there is not a news media source that they trust for information about the health law; 44% said there were news outlets they trusted.

Overall, about half of Americans (49%) say the government has not gone far enough in regulating financial institutions and markets, leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis, while 42% say the government has gone too far, making it harder for the economy to grow. These views are largely unchanged over the past several years. By roughly two-to-one, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to say financial regulations have gone too far (63%) than to say they have not gone far enough (31%). The balance of opinion among Democrats and Democratic leaners is reversed: More than twice as many Democrats say the government has not gone far enough in this area (62%) as say it has gone too far (29%). The partisan gap over financial regulation has changed little since Pew Research Center first asked the question in September 2013
In April, 46% thought a two-state solution in the Middle East could work, while 44% disagreed.

Across partisan groups, 60% of conservative Republicans say they are doubtful about the prospects for a two-state solution, while 36% think this can be achieved. Among liberal Democrats, a slim majority (55%) thinks a way can be found for an independent Palestinian state to peacefully coexist with Israel; 40% do not think this can happen.
An even larger share of women 40% of women say men prefer men as co-workers while 9% say men would rather work with women. But the pattern changes when men are asked about women s preferences. Now a larger share of men believes that women prefer to work with other women rather than with men (25% vs. 13%). In contrast, female respondents say that women favor male co-workers (21% say men vs. 10% say women) a view that is accurate based on women s actual answers.

By three-to-one (72% to 24%), Republicans favor expanding the border wall. Democrats oppose this proposal by an even wider margin (85% vs. 13% in favor). The combined responses to both measures reveal Republican divisions on these issues: 34% of Republicans both oppose permanent legal status for immigrants brought to this country illegally as children and favor an expanded border wall. However, nearly as many Republicans (30%) favor both policies, while another 17% favor legal status for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children and oppose an expanded U.S.-Mexico border wall
more than 2 million first-time applications have been received by EU member countries, Norway and Switzerland since January 2015, far more than any previous wave of asylum seekers since the years following World War II. The 2015 surge of asylum seekers continues to strain European governments. Since November 2015, the number of pending applications has exceeded 1 million among EU countries, Norway and Switzerland, and could take another year to clear
About seven-in-ten Druze (72%) say their religious identity is very important to them
LGBT respondents who said in our 2013 survey that they had not told their parents about their sexual orientation or gender identity were asked in an open-ended question, Why not? Two main reasons emerged: 1) Some felt it was not important to tell their parent, or the subject never came up; and 2) some assumed their parent would not be accepting or understanding of this, or they worried about how it would affect their relationship with their parent. Most gay men and lesbians who told their parents about their sexual orientation, however, said their relationship with that parent either grew stronger afterward or stayed the same, while very few said their relationship weakened. Read more about LGBT Americans coming out experience, in their own words.

(On a per capita basis based on purchasing power parity dollars, however, the U.S. outranks the EU, as well as China and Japan.) The Japanese, much like Europeans, tend not to see their own country as the world s top economic power. Just 7% of Japanese say this, and Japan does in fact rank behind China, the EU and the U.S. in GDP.

Germans now see their country s relationship with China as equally important as their relationship with the U.S. In 2019, about twice as many Germans prioritized their country s relationship with the U.S. over China (50% vs. 24%). Since then, however, the share of Germans who say it is more important for their country to have a close relationship with the U.S. has fallen 13 percentage points, while the share who prioritize a close relationship with China has gone up by 12 points. Today, 37% of Germans say they prioritize their country s relationship with the U.S. while a nearly equivalent share (36%) prioritize relations with China.

In the UK itself, 39% say their country s position in the world has diminished in the last 10 years. These views are largely unchanged since 2016. In the UK, those who support the populist UK Independence Party are more likely to say their country s global status has increased, compared with those who feel unfavorably toward the party (31% vs. 20%, respectively). Meanwhile, Brits with a favorable view of the EU are more likely to say their country plays a less important role in the world than Brits with an unfavorable view of the EU (45% vs. 35%).

Despite the rise of marriages between spouses with college degrees, only 22% of all newlyweds in 2012 were in this type of marriage. Another 19% were between spouses with a high school diploma or less. The share was 16% for newlyweds with some college education (but no bachelor s degree). Does marrying someone with less education mean marrying down economically? Not necessarily. When we look at the newlywed women who married someone with less education, we find that a majority of these women actually married up. In 2012, only 39% of newlywed women who married a spouse with less education out-earned their husband, and a majority of them (58%) made less than their husband.
About six-in-ten (58%) say the U.S. effort against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria is going either not too well (39%) or not at all well (19%); 35% say the campaign is going either very (7%) or fairly (28%) well

The South African parliament legalized same-sex marriage in November 2006, one year after the country s highest court ruled that the existing, more restrictive marriage laws violated the constitution s guarantee of equal rights. The new measure passed by a margin of greater than five-to-one, with support coming from both the governing African National Congress as well as the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance. The traditional monarch of the Zulu people, who account for about one-fifth of the country s population, maintains that homosexuality is morally wrong. The law allows for religious institutions and civil officers to refuse to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies, a provision that critics claim violates the rights of same-sex couples under the constitution.

Nearly eight-in-ten in Chile (79%), Argentina (78%) and Venezuela (77%) said they approved of the renewal of relations between the U.S. and Cuba, as did 67% of those in Brazil and 54% of those in Mexico. There was similarly broad support for ending the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. Support for ending the embargo was stronger among Latin Americans with higher incomes, compared with lower-income respondents. Correction: A sentence that read, in part, In 2013, 57% of Cuban Americans had been born in Cuba was changed to In 2013, 57% of Hispanics of Cuban origin were foreign born because not all foreign-born Hispanics of Cuban origin in the U.S. were born in Cuba.

In a survey just before the election, 85% of U.S. adults said Biden and Trump supporters disagree not only over plans and policies, but also over basic facts. As the nation moves on from a bitterly contested election, these dynamics and others point to the obvious challenges that lie ahead. But the outlook isn t uniformly bad. Voters across the political divide, for example, want the next president to govern in a unifying way. In October, 89% of Biden supporters and 86% of Trump supporters said their preferred candidate should focus on addressing the needs of all Americans, even if it means disappointing some supporters. Only around one-in-ten in both camps said their candidate should focus on the concerns of those who voted for him without worrying too much about the concerns of those who didn t.
Many are skeptical about the need for cosmetic procedures and other current enhancements.

Among Germans, this constitutes a sharp elevation in negative assessments since 2017, when 56% said the relationship was bad. Despite their generally negative perceptions, only one-in-ten Germans say the relationship with the U.S. is very bad. Most Americans (58%), for their part, say the relationship is somewhat good, while a far smaller share (12%) say it is very good. 2Seven-in-ten Americans say the U.S. should cooperate more with Germany, but only 41% of Germans say Germany should cooperate more with the U.S.

Average household size will likely exceed 2.58 persons in 2020 if the current pace of household growth holds. Note: There are two ways to look at trends regarding households in the U.S. In this analysis, which treats all households equally, the average household has 2.6 people. Other analyses look at it through the prism of the average person and find that the average person lives in a household with 3.4 people. The average based on people gives more weight to larger households since there are more people residing in them.
In October 2019, roughly nine-in-ten Democrats with a high level of knowledge about science (89%) said human activity contributes a great deal to climate change, compared with 41% of Democrats with low science knowledge, based on an 11-item knowledge index. By contrast, Republicans with a high level of science knowledge were no more likely than those with a low level of knowledge to say human activity plays a strong role in climate change. A similar pattern was found regarding people s beliefs about energy issues. These findings illustrate that the relationship between people s level of science knowledge and their attitudes can be complex. Note: This is an update of a post originally published on April 19, 2019.
Estimates of the number of internally displaced people last year range from 32 million to more than 38 million; according to the UNHCR data, Syria, Colombia and Iraq together accounted for 17.3 million IDPs.
Seven-in-ten suburban residents and two-thirds of urban dwellers say they subscribe to broadband services at home, compared with 58% of rural adults, according to a separate Pew Research Center survey conducted in January. Beyond lower home broadband adoption rates, adults in rural areas also are less likely to own mobile devices or to use the internet.

Despite this sense of commonality with Democratic leaders, residents of districts that changed hands are not particularly optimistic that the situation in Washington will improve. Just 37% think the Democratic leaders have made an effort to reach out to Republicans to work out solutions to policy problems. In this regard, they have more in common with residents of Republican held districts (33%) than residents of districts that were already Democratic in 2006 (46%). But George W. Bush receives even worse ratings only 26% think Bush is making an effort to reach out to Democrats. Here, they share the skepticism of those who live in consistently Democratic districts (29%). And residents of the districts that changed hands are the most likely to see Bush s presidency as a failure overall. Just shy of two-thirds (65%) say Bush s failures will outweigh his accomplishments more than in both consistently Democratic (59%) and Republican (47%) districts.
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 45% think people like themselves will gain influence by Trump s taking office, while just 13% say they will lose influence. Four-in-ten think they will not be affected.

Among Americans who seldom or never participate in these activities, smaller majorities report feeling gratitude and thankfulness. For instance, among Americans who do not believe in God, 58% say they regularly feel a sense of gratitude. And roughly six-in-ten (62%) Americans who say that religion is not too or not at all important express these feelings. In addition, feelings of gratitude are common among a wide variety of groups. For example, more than three quarters of Americans with less than a college education (77%) as well as those with a college degree (79%) feel gratitude and thankfulness on a weekly basis. And those at the low end of the economic ladder adults who earn less than $30,000 per year are equally as likely as better-off Americans to regularly feel thankful.

In 2017, just 36% of Republicans and Republican leaners said colleges and universities have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country, an 18-percentage-point decline from two years prior. By contrast, 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners said colleges and universities have a positive effect, which was little changed from prior years. This partisan dynamic also extends to views of college professors. On a feeling thermometer ranging from 0 to 100, a Pew Research Center study last fall found that Republicans gave professors an average rating of 46, compared with an average rating of 71 among Democrats. In the same survey, Americans across the political spectrum rated teachers warmly, though there were still significant differences by party. While Republicans gave teachers an average rating of 72, Democrats gave teachers an average rating of 86. Note: See full topline results and methodology here (PDF).

Republicans are divided on this question, with as many favoring a foreign focus as a domestic one, but Democrats and independents overwhelmingly want domestic policy to be the focus. When the choice is posed as domestic policy or the war on terrorism as opposed to foreign policy more generally domestic policy is still the preferred focus, but only by a plurality (46% domestic policy vs. 38% war on terrorism).
Overall, the public remains skeptical about the prospects of Cuba shifting in a democratic direction but more (43%) say they think the communist country will become more democratic over the next several years than did so in January (32%).

Blacks are about twice as likely as whites to say that the shooting of Michael Brown raises important issues about race that need to be discussed. Wide racial differences also are evident in opinions about of whether local police went too far in the aftermath of Brown s death, and in confidence in the investigations into the shooting. The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 14-17 among 1,000 adults, finds that the public overall is divided over whether Brown s shooting raises important issues about race or whether the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves: 44% think the case does raise important issues about race that require discussion, while 40% say the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves.

A majority of the foreign policy experts surveyed say that relations between the U.S. and Europe will get worse over the next 12 months when it comes to the areas of diplomacy (78% worse), economics (63%) and security (63%). Transatlantic publics, on the other hand, are much less worried about the future of relations with the U.S. Pluralities or majorities of nine of the 11 publics surveyed outside the U.S. think that now that Trump is president, relations between their country and the U.S. will stay the same over the next few years. A median of 37% across all 11 countries expect relations to worsen, while just 9% believe things will get better

Just 16% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are satisfied with the way things are going today. This is down from 33% in January and 52% in October. While it is typical for partisan views of the country s direction to shift following a change in party control of the presidency, the size of the shift among both Democrats and Republicans is more pronounced today than it was in either 2001 (when GOP views grew more positive and Democratic views more negative after the transition from Clinton to Bush) or in 2008 (when Democratic views became more positive and Republican views more negative at the beginning of the Obama administration).
In Lebanon, which shares a long border with conflict-ridden Syria, 92% of the public is worried about Islamic extremism, up 11 points from the already high figure of 81% in 2013
In Denver and Macon, print-only readers have lower incomes compared with online newspaper readers. And these print-only readers are less likely to be highly engaged with local civic and political activities such as neighborhood organizations or contacting elected officials. Even in the digital age, home distribution remains a key link between newspapers and their readers. And should the print product become a thing of the past, evidence from these three cities suggests that the impact would be felt disproportionately by about half of their audience indeed, a particularly vulnerable contingent at that.

The results of a recent Pew Global Attitudes survey show that the Japanese public was ready for just such a change: 76% would have favored amending the Imperial Household Act to allow a female to take the throne.1 And there is widespread agreement on this question across Japanese society. Women and men, young and old, the well-educated and the less-educated all support the idea of a female heading the royal family. However, now that a prince (he has not been given a name yet) has been born, most experts believe the debate over reforming the succession law is probably over. Instead of becoming Japan s first Empress since the eighteenth century, young Aiko will in all likelihood remain a Princess.
The typical outlet is between four and six years old; editorially, it is focused on coverage of local or even neighborhood-level news; it is just as likely to operate as a nonprofit organization as for-profit model; and it has a lean full-time editorial staff of three or fewer people. In total, these small digital operations have created about 2,000 of the roughly 5,000 full-time editorial jobs we identified in the digital news world, and they represent a growing and increasingly important part of a shifting media ecosystem. Here s what they re like:

By contrast, Democrats satisfaction with the country has plummeted following the election: Just 16% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are satisfied with the way things are going today. This is down from 33% in January and 52% in October. While it is typical for partisan views of the country s direction to shift following a change in party control of the presidency, the size of the shift among both Democrats and Republicans is more pronounced today than it was in either 2001 (when GOP views grew more positive and Democratic views more negative after the transition from Clinton to Bush) or in 2008 (when Democratic views became more positive and Republican views more negative at the beginning of the Obama administration).

An overwhelming majority of U.S. adults (88%) say the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks the same share as in 2016, when the Center last asked this question while the share who consider its preventive health benefits to be very high has grown by 11 percentage points during that time (from 45% to 56%). A 69% majority of Americans consider the risk of side effects from the vaccine to be either low or very low, about the same as in 2016
Private households were the most immigrant-intensive industry in 2014. Of the 947,000 people working for private households, 45% were immigrants, with lawful immigrants slightly outnumbering unauthorized immigrants. The industries with the next-biggest shares of immigrant workers were textile, apparel and leather manufacturers (36%) and the farm sector: A third (33%) of the nearly 2 million agriculture workers in 2014 were born outside the U.S.
Two-thirds of Democrats (66%) and 35% of Republicans rate this as a top priority. Most members of both parties (94% of Democrats and 82% of Republicans) say it is either a top priority or an important but lower priority. For the most part, there are only modest differences in the policy priorities across age groups. But those younger than 30 are much more likely than those 65 and older to say that supporting scientific research and improving the educational system should be top priorities. Older Americans, by contrast, attach more importance than younger Americans to several policy objectives including defending against terrorism (84% vs. 69%), and securing Social Security (69% vs. 67%). The age differences are especially large when it comes to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests in Washington. Twice as many adults 65 and older (56%) compared with those under 30 (28%) view reducing the influence of lobbyists as a top priority.

In 2013, 30% of adults had used a library website over the past 12 months, while the new finding is that 31% have done so in the past year
Fewer say they have a very great deal or good deal of confidence (39%). Among the general public, views regarding the political wisdom of the American people are largely unchanged over the past year. Republicans, however, have become less likely to express trust and confidence in the wisdom of the American people when it comes to political decisions. In March 2018, prior to the Democratic Party winning control of the House of Representatives, a narrow majority of Republicans said they have a very great or good deal of confidence (54%). Today, fewer than half (43%) of Republicans express confidence. During that same period, Democrats views have remained mostly unchanged. A year ago, 32% of Democrats expressed confidence in the political wisdom of the American people. Today, 36% say this. Most Democrats continue to say they have not very much (50%) or no confidence at all (11%) in the political wisdom of the American people.

A majority of Americans (57%) say Washington does consider other nations, but nearly two-thirds of Russians (65%) say it does not. This sentiment in Russia has been consistent since the question was first posed in 2002. Similarly, most Americans since then have also said the U.S. listens to other countries when making foreign policy. In 2002, however, 75% of Americans said this was the case, compared with 57% seen today. Note: See full topline results (PDF) and methodology here.
Overall, 45% say using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world, while about as many (46%) say relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism

Large majorities also say the right to privacy (87%) and freedom of religion (85%) are essential to them
In 2019, the most recent year available, NIBRS received violent and property crime data from 46% of law enforcement agencies, covering 44% of the U.S. population that year. Some researchers have warned that the transition to a new system could leave important data gaps if more law enforcement agencies do not submit the requested information to the FBI.
Democrats continue to be the most positive, with 73% expressing a favorable view

U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico, and that remains the case this year though the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015. 9Russians give Trump higher marks than they gave Obama or Bush. Amid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. and its president have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Russians ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 the last time the Center polled in Russia favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common, and Trump gets better reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.

Another open-ended question in the same 2017 survey asked Americans to predict the biggest improvements to life over the next 50 years. The top responses were expected improvements from technology (22%) or from medicine and health (20%). Expectations for biomedical and technological advancements are in keeping with a 2016 Pew Research Center survey in which 81% of U.S. adults said they fully expected artificial organs to be routinely available for transplant, 66% said that most forms of cancer would probably be cured and 48% said humans would definitely or probably use implanted sensors to monitor or adjust all food and medications that enter the bloodstream in the next 50 years.

Majorities of Americans say it is likely Trump has done things that are unethical (72%) or illegal (64%) during his time in office or while he was campaigning for president. As noted, this survey was largely finished before Attorney General Barr announced that special counsel Robert Mueller had found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016. Nearly three-in-ten (29%) Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump definitely or probably has done things that are illegal during his time in office or while he was running for president.

When we looked at which countries are hosting the most refugees relative to their populations, Lebanon was far and away the leader. Our analysis, which used 2014 data from the UNHCR and international population estimates from the Census Bureau, found that the 1.15 million refugees in Lebanon last year nearly all of them fleeing the civil war in neighboring Syria represent nearly 20% of that country s population of 5.9 million. In second place was Jordan, where refugees also nearly all from Syria represent more than 8% of the population
Conservative Republicans are more doubtful than others about motives behind climate research findings. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to think research findings from climate scientists are influenced by the desire of scientists to advance their own careers and by their personal political leanings. About half or more of conservative Republicans say each of these two factors influences research findings most of the time
For women who lived with their spouse before marriage, the probability of being married for at least 20 years is somewhat lower 46%. Whether the couple was engaged when they lived together didn t make a difference in women s chances of long-lasting marriages. For men, the patterns are slightly different. In this case, it matters whether men are engaged to a partner they lived with before getting married. Men who lived with their future spouse without being engaged had a slightly lower chance of having a long-term marriage (49%) than those who were engaged first (57%). Men who didn t live with their partner before getting married had a 60% chance of celebrating their 20th anniversary.
While 45% of the population says that honest elections with the choice of at least two political parties are very important for Egypt s future, that number is down 11 percentage points from 2013. Egyptians are highly dissatisfied with the direction of their country, with roughly the same level of dissatisfaction as when Mubarak was removed from office in 2011. With Egyptians showing a declining lack of interest in voting, Egypt s leadership has attempted to drive up turnout via a last minute national holiday, possible enforcement of mandatory voting laws (with a $70 fine), and the extension of voting into a third day. All this adds up to a sense that a promise for a stable and prosperous Egypt, bolstered by democratic legitimacy, might not be achieved with one presidential vote.
Three-quarters say China, which finished third in the medal count, behind the United States and Russia, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, will win the most medals this summer. Only 15% think the U.S. will take home the most medals

By contrast, 8% of Americans now report that they read books using dedicated e-reader devices nearly identical to the 7% who reported doing so in 2011
Differences of over 50 percentage points are especially common in Western nations, including 54 points in the U.S., UK and Italy.

Note: Here are the questions asked for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.
Fully 94% of Americans have some awareness of the effort to develop driverless vehicles, and roughly two-thirds of the public anticipates that most vehicles on the road will be driverless within the next half-century with 9% predicting that this will occur in the next 10 years. Additionally, substantial shares of Americans think it s likely that within 20 years doctors will rely on computer programs to diagnose and treat most diseases (79% think this will definitely or probably happen); that most retail interactions will be fully automated and involve little or no human interaction between customers and employees (65%); and that most deliveries in cities will be made by robots or drones instead of humans (65%).
cyberattacks, China s environmental impact and job losses are very serious problems. Republicans are much more concerned than Democrats about the economic aspects of the U.S.-China relationship. They are much less worried than Democrats about China s impact on the global environment. In general, older Americans tend to see more serious challenges in U.S.-China relations than young people do. For instance, 53% of those ages 50 and older say China s human rights policies are a very serious problem, compared with just 38% of 18- to 29-year-olds.
In Spain, 62% say use of force is sometimes necessary while Germans are evenly divided with half saying the use of force is sometimes necessary and half saying it is not. In Britain, France, Spain and the U.S., conservatives, are more likely than liberals, to agree that the use of force is sometimes necessary to maintain world order. However, in the four countries, majorities across ideological groups express this view. When asked whether their country should get UN approval before using military force to deal with international threats, American opinion differs considerably from that of Western Europeans. Americans are almost evenly divided on the question, with 45% saying that the U.S. should have UN approval and 44% saying this would make it too difficult to deal with threats. In contrast, solid majorities in the four Western European nations surveyed, including about three-quarters in Spain (74%) and Germany (76%) say their country should have UN approval before it takes military action.
About three-in-four Indians express confidence in Obama, up from 48% in 2014

Nearly four-in-ten (37%) say they followed news about the economy very closely. About a quarter (26%) say they followed news about the economy more closely than other major stories. News about the economy accounted for 12% of the newshole measured by PEJ. That does not include 4% of coverage devoted to the debate over whether to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts. The tax debate was the most closely followed story for 7%; about two-in-ten (21%) say they followed this story very closely. While 11% say they followed news about the elections most closely, the same percentage say they followed news about the release of a jailed American hiker held in Iran that closely.

Once again, Republicans and Democrats vary in their views of the acceptability of sharing information with other entities, particularly when it comes to sharing data with state and local elected officials and with researchers who study infectious diseases. Republicans are 17 percentage points more likely than Democrats to think it is very or somewhat unacceptable for information to be available for use by state and local elected officials and by researchers who study infectious diseases. Partisans are more similar in their views of personal information being made available to health insurance companies or pharmaceutical companies.

(Only 49% said they strongly disagreed
Some 44% of Americans say they care a great deal about the issue of global climate change, one-third (33%) say they care some and 22% say they do not care much or at all. The segment that cares deeply about climate change is up slightly from 36% in 2016, the last time this question was asked.

Unauthorized immigrants from Mexico make up less than half of all unauthorized immigrants and have been a driver of the group s population decline the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico fell from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 4.9 million in 2017. Back to top About one-quarter of the U.S. foreign-born population is unauthorized immigrants, while the majority of the nation s immigrants are in the U.S. legally. Naturalized citizens account for the largest portion of the foreign-born population (45%).

In 1960, half (49%) of impoverished Americans lived in the South. By 2010, that share had dropped to 41%. Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period
Some 39% of Northeasterners and 35% of Southerners believe the Zika virus is a major threat to the American population, compared with 21% of Westerners and 28% of Midwesterners who say they think the threat level is high. Those paying the most attention to news about the Zika virus are more likely than others to view it as a threat. For instance, 74% of those who have heard a lot about Zika consider it a major threat to pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant, compared with 49% of those who have heard only a little or nothing about Zika who feel that way.

Two-thirds of Twitter news users (67%) regularly see at least six of the 11 news topics we asked about, compared with 57% of Facebook news users. When it comes to the individual topics, four are seen at higher rates among Twitter news users than Facebook news users: sports, business, international news, and national government and politics.

This was the top story for 8% and made up 2% of coverage. About two-in-ten men (18%) say they followed this news very closely, compared with 7% of women. These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media s coverage. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage were collected July 25-31, and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected July 28-31 from a nationally representative sample of 1,001 adults.
Overall, 83% of Democrats and Democratic leaners support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Among this group, 55% say the party is doing a good job representing their views on this issue; 38% say it is not. Democrats who oppose a path to legal status (16% of all Democrats and Democratic leaners) are more critical of their party: Just 30% say the party does a good job of reflecting their views, while 70% say it does not. On the Republican side, both supporters and opponents of legal status for undocumented immigrants think the GOP is not doing a good job representing their views. Republicans and Republican leaners who oppose legal status are somewhat more negative about the party on this issue (65% bad job vs. 30% good job) than those who support a pathway to legal status (55% bad vs. 36% good).

Another 39% say they have heard a little about it, while only about one-in-five Americans (19%) say they have heard a lot about the group
Seven-in-ten say people are better off in a free market economy, even though this means some may be rich while others are poor. This sentiment is true across demographic groups, and even those in the low-income category believe in the benefits of the free market system. The social changes in Chinese society that have accompanied the transformation and growth of the economy get a somewhat mixed review. On the one hand, about seven-in-ten (71%) say they like the pace of modern life
About a quarter of the public (24%) says they followed reports about the condition of the economy more closely than other top stories last week, while 21% followed news about the swine flu most closely

An additional 32% say they attend once or twice a month, or a few times a year. These attendance levels are comparable to those of U.S. Christians, 47% of whom say they attend services weekly or more, and greater than the 14% of American Jews who say the same. A majority also say that they pray at least some or all of the salah, or ritual prayers required of Muslims five times per day. Among all U.S. Muslims, fully 42% say they pray all five salah daily, while 17% pray at least some of the salah every day. A quarter say they pray less often, and just 15% say they never pray

Crime, however, is less of an issue in Russia than in previous years, with only 39% saying it is a very serious problem. In 2017, 52% said it was a top concern, which was already significantly lower than the three-quarters of Russians who were very concerned in 2002. On the bottom end of concerns in Russia are immigration and conflict between ethnic and nationality groups. Only 26% and 20%, respectively, name these as very big problems.
Among Americans, 36% choose the United Kingdom as the most or second-most important foreign policy partner. Roughly two-in-ten say China (23%) and Canada (20%) are top partners
In the first nine months of the year, there have been 541 newspaper stories written about the 2016 presidential campaign. That is double the number of stories (271) the 2012 campaign generated during the same time period in 2010. In the first nine months of 2006, there were 460 campaign stories written about the 2008 presidential race. That s higher than the coverage four years later, when President Obama did not have a challenger. This helps illustrate that in an election cycle with two potentially heated primary seasons (like 2008 and 2016) news coverage increases. Another reason for the uptick in campaign coverage this year may be related to headline-grabbing controversies involving possible candidates. Chris Christie s Bridgegate dispute earlier in the year put his 2016 hopes in the spotlight, and a recent debate about Chelsea Clinton s role at NBC also brought attention to Hillary Clinton s potential run for the presidency. You can see the methodology for this report here.
More than nine-in-ten (95%) describe the Self Defense Force s response positively. By contrast, only about 20% say the national government or Prime Minister Naoto Kan have responded well to the crisis

In 1980, only 13% of married women earned more than or about as much as their husbands. By 2000, the share had risen to 25%. Today, 31% of women who are married or cohabiting are contributing at least half of the couple s total earnings (including 28% who earn more than their husband or partner and 3% who earn about the same amount). In 69% of married or cohabiting couples, the man earns more than the woman, though this is down from 87% of married couples in 1980
Not surprisingly, Barack Obama has been far and away the most visible of the presidential candidates over the past week 70% say they have heard more about him in the news than the other candidates, compared with 15% who cite Hillary Clinton and just 3% who say they have heard the most about John McCain

only about 20% of K-12 students studied a foreign language in school, according to a 2017 report from the American Councils for International Education. This includes 14% who studied Spanish, 2% who learned French and 1% who were taking German courses. Most students in Ireland learn English and Gaelic, but neither is considered a foreign language. Likewise, the National University of Ireland found 30% of Irish graduates complete their secondary education without a foreign language in their final qualification. And while the UK does mandate that students study at least one foreign language in school, they have the latest minimum starting age of all countries in Europe (11 years old). Studies from the BBC and the British Academy have shown steady decreases in the number of British secondary students taking exams in foreign languages, with noteworthy drop-offs in French and German language students since 2017.
Two-thirds (67%) describe the presidential campaign as interesting far more than did so before the first primary contests in the 2012 and 2008 campaigns (36% and 37%, respectively). About half (48%) say the campaign is informative, which is identical to the share that described the campaign as informative in January 2012
Just over half whose views changed (56%) say social media is personally important in providing a venue to express their political opinions, compared with a third of social media users who have not changed a view in the past year (33%). While Americans who haven t changed their views put less personal importance in social media, majorities see these platforms as helping give a voice to underrepresented groups; highlighting important issues that might otherwise go unnoticed; or helping hold powerful people accountable for their actions. Those who have changed a view thanks to social media are somewhat more likely to agree that these statements describe social media well. At the same time, majorities in both camps also agree that social media distracts people from issues that are truly important or makes people think they are making a difference when they really aren t. Note: See full topline results and methodology here (PDF).
Both Republicans and Democrats are about as likely to say that talking about politics with people whom they disagree with is stressful and frustrating as say such conversations are interesting and informative

For the overall population, that ratio has been practically flat for most of the past four years, hovering between 58% and 59% indicating that, overall, the economy is creating just about enough new jobs to keep pace with population growth. But among racial and ethnic groups, the flattest employment-to-population ratio has been among whites fluctuating between 59% and 60% since late 2009. Over time, the ratio is expected to fall, as more whites retire than enter the labor force. The employment-to-population ratio for blacks, after bottoming out at 51.1% in mid-2011, has lately been moving higher, reaching 53.7% in July. And among Hispanics, the ratio (which closely tracked that of whites for a year and a half) spiked a few months ago; it now stands at 60.4%, a full percentage point higher than whites. All told, the numbers suggest a bit more jobs momentum for blacks and Hispanics.
Liberal Democrats have typically been more likely than their conservative and moderate counterparts to say that the field of candidates running for their party s nomination is excellent or good. However, the 26-percentage point gap between the positive assessments of liberal Democratic registered voters (71%) and conservative and moderate Democratic registered voters (45%) is the widest it has been in recent election cycles. Seven-in-ten (70%) conservative Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say the field of candidates running for their party s nomination are excellent or good. A smaller majority (56%) of moderate and liberal Republican registered voters also offer a positive assessment. Both conservative and more moderate Republicans are more satisfied with their party s field of candidates than they were in September 2007.
Barely a year after opposition candidate Henrique Capriles fell short in his effort to win the presidency from Maduro by less than one percent, most Venezuelans (52%) say the opposition has a bad influence on the country s direction nearly on par with Maduro s negative rating. Meanwhile, only six percent of Venezuelans say they sympathize with one of the individual parties or blocs that make up the opposition. By contrast, a third of Venezuelans (33%) continue to identify with Maduro s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) little changed from last year (36%). At least for now, it seems that problems with crime and the economy more than the political opposition will remain Maduro s main challengers. Here are more detailed results and survey methodology.
A majority of U.S. adults say it is at least somewhat likely that jobs such as fast food workers (77%) and insurance claims processors (65%) will be mostly performed by machines in their lifetime, while around half expect that the same will be true of jobs such as software engineers and legal clerks.

While 58% of Americans have a positive opinion of the UN, support varies considerably by political party. A strong majority of Democrats (72%) in the U.S. have a favorable view of the international body, while a smaller 60%-majority of independents agree. Meanwhile, support among Republicans trails at 41% and has dropped ten percentage points since 2011. In a few European countries, it is the political right more than the left that sees the UN most favorably. For example, two-thirds of French respondents on the right end of the spectrum have a positive opinion of the UN while only 56% on the left share the same view. Similar gaps occur in Spain (+11 right-left gap) and Greece (+12).
Roughly seven-in-ten U.S. teens (72%) say they use the site. Surpassed only by YouTube, Instagram ranks as the second most popular platform among Americans in this age group, according to a survey conducted in March and April of 2018.

The next section presents in text, charts and maps estimates of the distribution of the global population by income in 2001 and 2011, and also of the distributions in the major regions of the world. Subsequent sections highlight trends in individual countries and areas experiencing growth in middle-income populations, such as China and countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America; changes in India and other countries, such as in Africa, that experienced declines in poverty but minimal change in their middle-income populations; and trends in advanced economies, such as the U.S. and countries in Western Europe, which generally held on to their economic advantage over most of the rest of the world.
About half of Americans (48%) are at least somewhat confident that Senate Democrats will be fair and reasonable, while slightly fewer (43%) say the same about the Senate GOP

Currently, 39% say they followed news about the leak very closely last week, not much different from the 42% that said this one week earlier. Still, that is down sharply from 59% in the July 22-25 survey. More than four-in-ten (44%) say this was the story they followed most closely last week. The oil leak accounted for 3% of the coverage measured by PEJ, down from 11% one week earlier
We tested five of Trump s major national security and foreign policy proposals withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, placing tighter restrictions on people entering the U.S. from certain majority-Muslim nations, pulling out of international climate change agreements, withdrawing from trade deals and building a wall on the Mexican border and with a few exceptions, they meet with broad disapproval around the world

Nigeria is expected to have 864 million births between 2020 and 2100, the most of any African country. The number of births in Nigeria is projected to exceed those in China by 2070. Meanwhile, roughly a third of the world s babies are projected to be born in Asia by the end of this century
Confidence in Putin s global leadership has been consistently strong over the decade-and-a-half that Pew Research Center has polled in Russia. Trust in the Russian leader has remained high since an increase in 2014, shortly after the conflict with Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea. Today, however, Putin earns lower marks (63%) than he did two years ago (83%) for his handling of relations with Ukraine. Support for the Russian president has also declined when it comes to his approach to relations with the EU, China and the United States. Despite slippage in how well the public thinks their president is handling key foreign policies, a majority of Russians say their country plays a more important role on the world stage than it did 10 years ago

Among all registered voters, Obama approval and opinion of the Affordable Care Act appear about equally influential in shaping voter opinion, and are somewhat more important than economic attitudes among all voters. But the most important factor varies by key voting blocs. For independents, attitudes toward the health care law, which they largely disapprove of, is more important than opinion about Obama or the condition of the nation s economy. Similarly, the new health care law is most important for men, while opinions about Obama are more significant vote drivers among women. Opinions about the president are also more crucial to about 20% of voters who admit they are still on the fence about which party s candidate to cast a ballot for.

In fact, Bush continued to have the support of 8-in-10 conservative Republicans into 2006 and 2007 and retained strong approval among 6-in-10. (See Bush s five-year trend at the bottom of the post.) Among each one s base, neither Obama nor Bush had quite the combination of overall and strong support as their predecessor Bill Clinton at a similar point. In the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in September 1998, Clinton captured the same level of approval as Obama among liberal Democrats (91%) and 70% of Clinton s base strongly approved of his job.

About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, the latest year for which information is available, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. This represents a 36% decrease from a peak of about 390,000 in 2007. The analysis follows President Donald Trump s announcement that his administration may seek to end birthright citizenship. Births to unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. generally rose throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s but have declined since the start of the Great Recession about a decade ago, according to estimates based on data from the Census Bureau s American Community Survey and its Current Population Survey. The number of babies born to unauthorized immigrant parents represented about 6% of the 4.0 million total births in the U.S. in 2016, compared with 9% of all births in 2007

White evangelical Protestants continue to be among the most loyal supporters of the Republican Party, even if those loyalties are not as strong now as in the past few years. The most important unknown in the final weeks of the 2006 election campaign is how motivated evangelicals will be to turn out to vote. Despite discussion about the possibility that turnout among evangelicals might be depressed this year, Pew s latest poll finds evangelicals no more or less enthusiastic about voting than other groups in the electorate, and they are no different from registered voters as a whole in their overall likelihood of voting.
As of 2015, some 83 million people worked in jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation (including education, experience and job training), up from 49 million in 1980 a 68% increase.
