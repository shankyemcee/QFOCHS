Meanwhile , assessments of the U.S. impact on Ukraine are split : 38 % positive , 38 % negative . Russia is viewed with the greatest suspicion . Three times as many Ukrainians say Russia is having a bad influence on their country as say it is having a good impact ( 67 % vs. 22 % ) .

An estimate using a slightly different methodology suggests that the share of all U.S. married couples where the wife has more education than the husband is about 21 % .","In a Pew Research Center survey conducted last month ( Dec. 5 - 9 ) , 50 % of adults said they sympathized more with Israel in its dispute with the Palestinians . Just 10 % sympathized more with the Palestinians , while about as many ( 13 % ) volunteered that they sympathized with neither side . Attitudes toward Israel and the Palestinians have become more divided along partisan lines : In December , 70 % of Republicans sympathized with more Israel , while just 2 % sympathized more with the Palestinians and 7 % said they sympathized with neither side .","Marriage across racial and ethnic lines continues to be on the rise in the United States . The share of new marriages between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from each other increased to 15.1 % in 2010 , and the share of all current marriages that are either interracial or interethnic has reached an all - time high of 8.4 % .","The public continues to say they are hearing mixed news about the nation ’s economy : 59 % say they are hearing a mix of both good and bad news about the economy these days , while 32 % say they are hearing mostly bad news and only 6 % say they are hearing mostly good economic news .","Compare the public sympathies towards Israel and Palestinians based on composition.","Comment on the rise of marriages involving different racial background spouses.","What are the current thoughts of public regarding economic news?","",""

But while the debate and the battles continue , a new Pew Research Center poll finds that Americans overwhelmingly support these programs . Americans say by roughly two - to - one ( 63 % to 30 % ) that affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a “ good thing , ” according to the survey conducted Feb. 27 - Mar. 16 . This was almost the same result Pew Research found in 2003 . While a majority ( 55 % ) of whites support affirmative action programs on campus , that compares with 84 % of blacks who believe they are a good thing and 80 % of Hispanics . Nearly eight - in - ten ( 78 % ) Democrats back the programs as a good thing , as do 62 % of independents ; Republicans are mixed , with 50 % seeing the racial preferences as a bad thing and 43 % viewing them as a good thing .","Compare how much blacks and whites support affirmative action on campus.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/2094.png","50-year predictions % of USS adults who feel that the following will/won't happen in the next 50 years","A substantial majority of Americans ( 81 % ) believe that within the next 50 years people needing an organ transplant will have new organs custom made for them in a lab . Belief that this development will occur is especially high among men ( 86 % of whom believe this will happen ) , those under age 50 ( 86 % ) , those who have attended college ( 85 % ) , and those with relatively high household incomes . But although expectations for this development are especially high within these groups , three - quarters or more of every major demographic group feels that custom organs are likely to become a reality in the next half - century . The public is more evenly split on whether computers will soon match humans when it comes to creating music , novels , paintings , or other important works of art : 51 % think that this will happen in the next 50 years , while 45 % think that it will not . In contrast to their expectations for custom - built organs , college graduates and those with high incomes are comparatively unlikely to expect that computers will advance to this level of development . Some 59 % of college graduates and 57 % of Americans earning $ 75,000 or more per year feel that computers will not be able to produce works of art that are on par with those produced by humans within the next 50 years . Compared with custom organs and computer produced art , the public has less confidence that the two common science fiction tropes of teleportation and colonization of other planets will come to pass . Two in five Americans ( 39 % ) think that teleportation will be possible within the next 50 years , while slightly fewer—33%—expect to live in a world in which humans have long - term colonies on other planets . Young adults are especially likely to view space colonization as a long - term eventuality : 43 % of 18 - 29 year olds see this happening in the next half - century , compared with about a quarter of those over age 50 . On the other hand , high - income Americans are pessimistic about the prospects of space colonization : just 20 % of those with an annual household income of $ 75,000 or more think this is a realistic prediction . From a list of futuristic inventions that includes space colonies and teleportation , Americans actually have the least confidence in the prediction that humans of the future will be able to control the weather : just 19 % of the public thinks that this will probably happen . Older adults are especially pessimistic about this development , as just 11 % of Americans ages 65 and older think that controlling the weather is likely to happen over the next 50 years . But even among the most “ optimistic ” demographic groups , the expectation that humans will control the weather in the next half - century is a decidedly minority viewpoint .","Describe Americans views about the possibility of transplanting a lab-grown organ in the future.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/2095.png","Driverless cars?

College graduates are particularly interested in giving driverless cars a try : 59 % of them would do so , while 62 % of those with a high school diploma or less would not . There is also a geographical split on this issue : Half of urban ( 52 % ) and suburban ( 51 % ) residents are interested in driverless cars , but just 36 % of rural residents say this is something they ’d find appealing . Other potential inventions appeal to a much smaller proportion of the public . One quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) say they would get a brain implant to improve their memory or mental capacity if it were possible to do so , while 72 % would not . College graduates are the main demographic group that stands out on this issue : 37 % of them would be willing to get a performance - enhancing brain implant if given the chance . Similarly , just one in five Americans ( 20 % ) would be willing to eat meat that was grown in a lab . Men express a greater willingness to do so than women ( 27 % of men and 14 % of women say they would give lab grown meat a try ) , and college graduates are around three times as likely as those who have not attended college to say this is something they ’d attempt ( 30 % vs. 11 % ) .","How much do Americans want to use a driverless car?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/2534.png","Recent Shootings Had Little Impact on Gun Control Views Whatdo you thinkis more important?","Our most recent survey on the issue , conducted July 26 - 29 , 2012 , shortly after a gunman killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , found that 47 % said it was more important to control gun ownership , while 46 % said it was more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns .

Fewer than four - in - ten experts consider the U.S. trade deficit with China to be a very serious problem , compared with about six - in - ten of the broader public ; and even fewer experts express concern about the loss of U.S. jobs to China . Moreover , unlike the general public , experts are far more likely to support building a strong relationship with China than to back being tough with Beijing on economic issues .","The big question this year will be how many Hispanics , as well as how many in the public overall , turn out to vote . Currently a record number of Hispanics – 23.4 million – are eligible to vote . That ’s up from 19.5 million in 2008 .

Even though college graduates are increasingly more likely to marry each other , the overall share of couples of similar education levels is down from nearly 80 % in 1960 to about 60 % in 2012 . The primary reason for the decline in the share of married couples with similar education levels is that marriages between spouses with high school or less than high school education are much less common these days — the share is down from 74 % of all marriages in 1960 to 24 % in 2012 .

The historic moment may not have come as a surprise to many . Twenty years ago , about half of Americans ( 54 % ) thought the chances were good that we would have a black president by now , according to a 1993 Gallup / CNN / USA Today survey of U.S. adults , while 45 % thought the chances were slim .

As of 2011 , some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. , down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007 , according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Over the same period , the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly , from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011 . The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five - year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five - year period of 1995 to 2000 . Meantime , the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million , roughly double the number who had done so in the five - year period a decade before . While it is not possible to say so with certainty , the trend lines within this latest five - year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two .","Currently , only 32 % of independents approve of his job performance while 61 % disapprove .","Fully 41 % of Democrats held favorable views of the federal government , compared with only 13 % of Republicans .","Twenty years ago , about half of Americans ( 54 % ) thought the chances were good that we would have a black president by now , according to a 1993 Gallup / CNN / USA Today survey of U.S. adults , while 45 % thought the chances were slim .

For instance , the percentage of Germans with a favorable view of the U.S. fell from 78 % in 2000 to 60 % in 2002 , and in Britain it dropped from 83 % to 75 % . Immediately following the attacks of Sept. 11 , the “ war on terror ” received strong support in Western Europe , but as U.S. anti - terrorism efforts increasingly became associated with Iraq , Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and other unpopular aspects of American foreign policy , support plummeted .

The agency also reports that birth rates for women in their early 40s now are nearly as high as for teens . This turnabout results from four decades of generally rising birth rates among Canadian women ages 30 and older , and falling birth rates among those younger than 30 .

During the period from 2010 to 2011 , birth rates among teens ages 15 - 19 dropped 8 % , and among women ages 20 - 24 declined 5%—in both cases reaching historic lows in 2011 . At the other end of the age spectrum , the birth rate for women ages 40 - 44 rose 1 % , to 10.3 births per 1,000 women in that age group .

In 2010 , the gun suicide rate was 6.3 per 100,000 people , compared with 3.6 per 100,000 for gun homicides .","Yet the overall trend on whether it is more important to control gun ownership or protect gun rights has edged back in the direction of gun rights . And when it comes to the importance of gun policy as a voting issue , gun rights supporters have the advantage . In the days after the school shooting in Newtown , Conn. last December , more prioritized gun control than gun rights ( 49 % vs. 42 % ) , the first time this had occurred since Barack Obama became president . Roughly five months later , the public is again evenly divided over whether in general it is more important to control gun ownership ( 50 % ) or to protect the rights of Americans to own guns ( 48 % ) . This mirrors the close divide in opinion that existed prior to Newtown . ( See Pew Research Center ’s 20 years of public opinion data on gun rights and gun control . )","Rather , most people ( 57 % ) were bothered by what they saw as the system ’s basic unfairness – “ the feeling that some wealthy people get away with not paying their fair share . ” Only about half as many – 28 % – pointed to the tax system ’s complexity .","As he nears the end of his second term in office , Prime Minister Erdogan gets positive ratings for his handling of foreign affairs . About six - in - ten ( 62 % ) Turks have a lot or some confidence in Erdogan to do the right thing in world affairs , while one - third have little or no confidence in him . Beyond Turkey ’s borders , Erdogan is also popular in a number of neighboring Arab nations . Strong majorities of Egyptians ( 78 % a lot or some confidence ) , Jordanians ( 72 % ) , and Lebanese ( 64 % ) express confidence in the Turkish prime minister , who , along with his Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu , has in many ways raised Turkey ’s profile on the world stage in recent years . Erdogan , for example , has received considerable attention for breaking with previous Turkish policy and taking a more confrontational approach toward Israel regarding Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza . In the Palestinian territories themselves , Erdogan receives somewhat less support than in other Arab nations , with 52 % expressing confidence in the Turkish leader and 47 % saying they have little or no confidence in him . He is much more popular in the West Bank ( 61 % a lot or some confidence ) than in Gaza ( 35 % ) . The prime minister also fares poorly in Western Europe – clear majorities in Germany ( 69 % ) , Spain ( 63 % ) , and France ( 59 % ) give Erdogan a negative assessment . In the other European and predominantly Muslim nations where this question was asked , large numbers are unable to offer an opinion about the Turkish leader .","Currently , 28 % cite the federal budget deficit as the economic issue that most worries them , up from 24 % in March and 19 % in December . Despite this shift , however , the job situation remains the broader concern – 38 % say they worry most about jobs , up slightly from March ( 34 % ) though down from 47 % in December .","A quarter of the public ( 25 % ) says they very closely followed the ongoing discussions in Washington last week over how to handle the federal budget deficit and reduce the national debt ; just 8 % say this was the news they followed most closely . The only week this year when the deficit debate drew substantial public interest was in early April , when a government shutdown loomed . In the April 7 - 10 News Interest survey , 47 % followed news about the threat of a shutdown very closely and 31 % followed this story most closely . Nearly two - in - ten ( 18 % ) say they followed news about the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians very closely ; 5 % say this was the news they followed most closely .
