This decline , from a high of $ 714 billion in 2019 to an estimated $ 572 billion in 2020 , comes as the world ’s largest remittance - sending nations have experienced especially stringent lockdowns , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the World Bank , Oxford University and Google . The decline in remittances is projected to hit all regions of the world , as many of the 272 million international migrants lose their jobs and stop sending money home . Remittances to European and Central Asian countries the World Bank defines as low and middle income are projected to decline by 28 % , while slightly smaller declines are expected for low- and middle - income nations in sub - Saharan Africa ( 23 % ) , South Asia ( 22 % ) , Latin America and the Caribbean ( 19 % ) , and the Middle East and North Africa ( 20 % ) , according to the World Bank . These projections are based on information about prevailing wages and the number of international migrants in each country . It is not unusual for worldwide remittances from migrants to ebb and flow with economic circumstances in sending countries . In 2009 , during the Great Recession , global remittances declined 5 % as economies shrank . And in 2016 , remittances fell 1 % , driven by weak growth in many countries and declining oil prices . Remittances can also increase during hard times in migrants ’ home countries . For example , remittances to Yemen more than doubled between 2011 and 2019 amid a civil war in that country .",What is the impact of COVID-19 on remittances sent by migrants to their countries of origin?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/1194.png,Democrats with less education more likely to split with party on abortion,"Overall , roughly one - third of Americans who identify as Republican or as Republican - leaning independents do not agree with their party on abortion ( 35 % ) , including 12 % who say they agree with the Democratic Party on abortion and 23 % who say they do not agree with either party .
