At the time , fewer than a quarter of online Indians said they were engaging in commerce or taking a class , but roughly a third or more were getting information about health , government services or politics online . Indians do n’t necessarily see the increasing influence of the internet in India as a good thing for the country . In a 2014 survey , only 31 % of Indians said that the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on politics , 32 % said it was good for personal relationships and 37 % said it was good for morality .

Cruz and Kasich supporters are more skeptical of Trump ’s ability to unite the party than were supporters of prior candidates who did not become the GOP ’s eventual nominee in past elections . A slim majority of Republican voters who supported candidates Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul in February 2008 said they believed the party would solidly unite behind John McCain if he were to become the nominee ( as he later did ) .

Across 14 countries , a similarly low median of 37 % say China has done a good job of handling COVID-19 . In evaluating the U.S. response , only 3 % of the scholars say the U.S. has done a good job of containing the outbreak compared with 47 % of Americans who say the same .

Among mothers , those with children ages 3 and older experienced a slightly greater decrease in the share employed and at work ; among fathers , the decrease in this share was greater among those with children younger than 3 . Reflecting the gender gap in childcare , mothers with children younger than 3 are less likely to be at work . In September 2020 , 53.9 % of these mothers were employed and at work , compared with 70.4 % of mothers whose youngest child was 14 to 17 years old .

Meanwhile , over the same period , Puerto Ricans made up a larger share of the state ’s Hispanic eligible voters , rising from 25 % to 27 % . These changes have been driven by the outmigration of Puerto Ricans from the island to central Florida and the movement of Puerto Rican - origin Hispanics in the northeast U.S. to central Florida .
