Less than half (48%) of grandparents with grandchildren at home are white, while 75% of Americans overall ages 50 and older are white. Meanwhile, Hispanics, blacks and Asians make up a larger share of grandparents with grandchildren at home than they do of the 50+ population overall.",good

In that time period the shares that are Hispanic and Asian have grown. WICHE projects that this trend will continue, with the public high school graduating class of 2025 being barely majority white (51%).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10096.png,"As is generally the case for views about China on specific issues, there is a notable partisan gap on the overall favorability measure. 		More than six-in-ten Republicans (63%) give China an unfavorable rating, compared with 51% of independents and 50% of Democrats. Negative assessments of China are also more common among older Americans. Fully 64% of those ages 50 and older have a negative opinion, while just 39% hold this view among people under age 30.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10114.png,"In 2014, just 28% of Millennials were married. This makes them remarkably different than members of the Silent Generation at the same stage in their lives: fully 64% of Silents were married when members of their generation were between the ages of 18 and 33. About half (49%) of Baby Boomers and 38% of Gen Xers were married when their generation was ages 18 to 33. Generational analysis allows for these comparative snapshots, but it also lets researchers track what happens as these cohorts age.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10122.png,"The survey also asked if a number of descriptions applied to the people of their generation. Silents are far more likely than people in younger age cohorts to view their own generation in a positive light. Large majorities of Silents say the people of their generation are hard-working (83%), responsible (78%), patriotic (73%), self-reliant (65%), moral (64%), willing to sacrifice (61%) and compassionate (60%).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10091.png,"But perhaps just as striking is that the geographic distribution of the poor has changed dramatically, too. A new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that the South continues to be home to many of America’s poor, though to a lesser degree than a half-century ago. In 1960, half (49%) of impoverished Americans lived in the South. By 2010, that share had dropped to 41%. Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period. As rural areas, such as in the Midwest, have become less impoverished since the 1960s, those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall. At the same time, urban centers have gained in total population and hold a greater share of the U.S. population overall.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10115.png,"The pattern of religious identity is another fundamental difference between the generations. Older generations identify overwhelmingly as Christian. For example, 85% of the Silent generation identify as a member of a Christian denomination, while just 11% say they are religiously unaffiliated (defined as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular”). By contrast, smaller majorities of Millennials (56%) and Gen Xers (70%) identify as Christian, while as many as 35% of Millennials and 23% of Gen Xers do not identify with any organized religion. Over the past seven years, the share of the U.S. population that does not identify with an organized religion has grown since 2007. Much of this change has occurred due to generational replacement; the youngest adults who are aging into the population are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated than the oldest adults they are replacing.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10119.png,"As with partisan affiliation, there are substantial differences in the ideological leanings of generations. Based on data from the Pew Research Center’s 2014 Political Polarization survey, Millennials are currently the least conservative generation. Across a set of 10 political values questions on issues such as the role of government, the environment and business, just 15% of Millennials express either consistently or mostly conservative views compared with 44% who have a mix of liberal and conservative views and fully 41% who express consistently or mostly liberal views. By comparison, more Gen Xers (25%), Baby Boomers (33%) and Silents (39%) express consistently or mostly conservative views across this set of 10 questions.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10123.png,"The Millennial generation also encompasses a broad span of adults (currently those born from 1981 to 1997). But just 40% of those in this cohort consider themselves Millennials, while as many as a third (33%) say they belong to Gen X. Among older Millennials (ages 27 to 34), 43% consider themselves Gen Xers, while 35% identify as Millennials. Yet even among younger Millennials (ages 18 to 26), fewer than half (45%) consider themselves part of this generation. Most adults (58%) born between 1965 and 1980, the birth years of Gen X, identify with “their” generation. Notably, relatively few Gen Xers (just 4%) identify as Millennials, but 15% consider themselves Boomers. Among younger Gen Xers (ages 35 t0 42), 68% identify with Gen X; among older Gen Xers, fewer (48%) see themselves as part of this generation, while 24% identify as Boomers.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10124.png,"Aside from being asked about their generational identity, respondents also were asked how well each generational term applies. In this case, the differences between Boomers and the other three generations are even starker. Seven-in-ten Boomers (70%) say the term “Baby-Boom generation” applies to them very well (31%) or fairly well (39%). Among other generations, no more than about four-in-ten (38% of Gen X) say their generational label is a good fit.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10125.png,"While 59% of Millennials describe the members of their generation as self-absorbed, 49% say they are wasteful and 43% describe them as greedy. On all three dimensions, Millennials are significantly more critical of their generation than older age cohorts are of theirs. And while Silents are more likely than other generations to say that several positive terms describe their generation, they also are less likely to say some negative terms apply. Only about one-in-ten Silents see the people of their generation as self-absorbed (7%), wasteful (10%) and greedy (8%) – by far the lowest shares of any cohort. There are smaller differences among generations over whether the term “cynical” describes people in their age cohort: 31% of Millennials say it applies, compared with 24% of Gen X, 16% of Boomers and just 7% of Silents. Relatively few across all generations – only about one-in-ten – say the term “rigid” applies.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10126.png,"Sizable minorities of cultural Catholics also participate in some of the church’s rituals. For instance, about a third of cultural Catholics (32%) say they attend Mass at least once a year, and roughly a quarter (26%) say they receive Holy Communion at least sometimes when they attend Mass. A third (33%) say they gave something up or did something extra for Lent this year, and about four-in-ten (41%) say it would be important to them to receive the sacrament of the anointing of the sick (sometimes part of “last rites”) if they were seriously ill.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10131.png,"Contrasting Asia-Pacific views of China may in part be explained by differing levels of concern about regional territorial disputes with Beijing. 		The Filipinos (91% concerned), Vietnamese (83%) and Japanese (83%) are the most troubled by these territorial frictions,  		 according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of Asia-Pacific perceptions of various global threats. And they are also the three countries in the region with the highest unfavorable ratings of China.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10135.png,"Most American Catholics are comfortable with family arrangements that have been traditionally frowned upon by the church. For example, most U.S. Catholics say it is at least “acceptable” – and many say it is just “as good as” any other arrangement – for children to be raised by unmarried parents, gay or lesbian parents, single parents or divorced parents. Majorities also are accepting of a husband and wife who choose not to have children, a man and woman living together romantically without being married, and a same-sex couple living together. Among all U.S. adults who were raised Catholic, half (52%) have left the church at some point in their life. This includes some whose departure was only temporary: 11% of all people raised Catholic left the church but later returned. But about four-in-ten of those raised Catholic now do not identify as Catholic by religion, including 28% who do not identify as Catholic in any way (“ex-Catholics”).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10136.png,"Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly are more likely than other Catholics to have opinions that align with church policies and teachings. But even among frequent churchgoers, majorities are open to non-traditional family arrangements. For example, roughly a third of Catholics who attend Mass weekly (34%) say children being raised by a same-sex couple is acceptable and as good as any other arrangement, which is similar to the share who see this as unacceptable (36%).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10138.png,"Women, blacks, Asians and Hispanics have built up substantial positions as business owners in several sectors of the U.S. economy. But based on revenue, those businesses are on average considerably smaller than white- or male-owned firms, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall, men owned more than half of the nation’s 27.6 million firms in 2012, according to preliminary results from the Survey of Business Owners, and women owned more than 9.9 million businesses, about 36% of the total. The remaining 10% of firms were either jointly owned by men and women or could not be categorized by gender because they were publicly traded companies or have large, diverse ownership groups.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10140.png,"Historically, women have been more avid users of social media than men – a finding consistent across several Pew Research Center surveys. In fact, in November 2010, the gender gap was as large as 15 percentage points. More recent data, however, show that these differences are no longer statistically significant. A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that a similar share of men and women say they used social networking sites this year, consistent with what we found in 2014. Some 73% of online men use social media, which is on par with the 80% of online women who say they do so.",good

mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10875.png,"A 2014 Pew Research Center survey of 43 countries around the world showed that a median of 65% of people in Latin America had a positive view of the U.S. While not quite as positive as attitudes toward America in Africa (74%), this level of approval is on par with views in Europe (66%) and Asia (66%) and much higher than in the Middle East (30%). The survey was conducted last spring before Obama’s diplomatic opening to Cuba. Majorities in all but one of nine Latin American countries surveyed view the U.S. favorably. Attitudes toward the U.S. have remained positive or grown more favorable in four countries Pew Research surveyed in both 2007 and 2014. In 2007, a majority of Chileans (55%) said they had a favorable view of the U.S. This number jumped to 72% in 2014, an increase of 17 percentage points. And in Argentina, the Latin American country most critical of the U.S., favorable views have jumped 20 points, from only 16% in 2007 to 36% now. The change has been less marked in Mexico, where favorable opinions of the U.S. have increased by 7 percentage points (56% favorable in 2007 vs. 63% in 2014). Favorable views of the U.S. in Peru remained steady, going from 61% in 2007 to 65% in the latest survey.",good

In fact, non-Hispanic whites, the largest group in most states, account for only 23% of the population, according to 2013 census figures. But the real population story is about Native Hawaiians, those who are descended from the original people of Hawaii and who today make up 6% of the islands’ population, or 21% if you include those who are part-Hawaiian. A new demographic analysis, using an innovative technique, estimates that there were 683,000 Native Hawaiians on the island in 1778, when British explorer Capt. James Cook arrived. That’s on the higher range of the highly disputed historical estimates, which have ranged from as low as 200,000 to as high as 1 million.

mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10915.png,"2) App response rates were lower than Web rates overall and for each of the 14 surveys we conducted. When conducting a new poll, survey researchers often go to a lot of trouble to find out how many of the people they targeted to take the survey actually end up completing the questionnaire, a concept referred to as the response rate. In this case, we found that those who were asked to take the survey on a Web browser were more likely to complete at least one survey than those using apps to take the survey, resulting in overall response rates of 84% and 58%, respectively. Part of this may be due to the fact that many panelists assigned to use the app had trouble using it because they didn’t know what an app was, how to download it or how to use it even though they own a smartphone. In the future, we will take this into consideration because if fewer people use the survey app, this has implications for both the precision of the data collected and for cost. 3) App and Web respondents look similar demographically, and their answers basically did not differ. App respondents were somewhat younger, more likely to be from the Midwest and less likely to be registered to vote than Web respondents. Overall, app respondents looked slightly more like all smartphone users than did the Web respondents. In the final reckoning, though, both the app and Web respondents look similar enough in terms of demographics that either could be used to represent all smartphone users.",good

mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10984.png,"When it comes to public libraries, immigrant Hispanics pose both a challenge and an opportunity to the library community. On the one hand, this group, which makes up half of the adult U.S. Hispanic population, is less likely than other Americans to have ever visited a U.S. public library and is much less likely to say that they see it as “very easy” to do so. At the same time, Hispanic immigrants who have made their way to a public library stand out as the most appreciative of what libraries have to offer, from free books to research resources to the fact that libraries tend to offer a quiet, safe space. And they are more likely than other groups to say that closing their community library would have a major impact on their family. These are some of the findings of this latest installment of the Pew Research Center’s reporting on the Center’s landmark 2013 Library Services Survey. Seven-in-ten 		(72%) Latinos ages 16 and older say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person at one point or another in their lives,  		 the survey shows, a share below that of whites (83%) and blacks (80%). But this finding masks a large difference among Latinos. Fully 		83% of U.S.-born Latinos say they have visited a public library at some point in their lives—a share similar to that of whites and blacks. However, among immigrant Latinos, a smaller share—60%—say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person. Some public library services can also be accessed remotely through library websites.
