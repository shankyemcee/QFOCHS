The New York Times’ David Carr warned, that in one such scenario, “companies that own large groups of local stations like the Tribune Company and the Sinclair Broadcast Group would suddenly find themselves in possession of a much diminished collection of assets.” If that potential threat looms, it hasn’t slowed these media companies from dramatically expanding their local television holdings in recent years. A decade ago, the number of stations owned by what are now the five largest local TV companies was 190. Today, that number is 464. In 2013, alone, about 300 full-power local TV stations changed hands, at a cost of more than $8 billion.

Second, what Pew Research described as classified information the WP/ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism.

In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage was collected from March 10-16 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week was collected March 14-17 from a nationally representative sample of 1,005 adults.",unquestionable

Like much of Western Europe, over the last few years Italy has wrestled with how to successfully integrate and assimilate its Muslim minority. Additionally, the recent influx of Romanian immigrants — especially Roma, or gypsies from Romania — into Italy has led to new controversies over immigration. The 2007 Pew poll included a number of questions on immigration, and on each of these, Italians held the most negative opinions of any Western public.Nearly two-thirds of Italians (64%) believe immigration is a very big problem for their country. In no other Western nation did a majority rate immigration a very big problem (Spain was the closest at 42%). In fact, Italy’s level of concern was the highest, not only among Western countries, but among all 47 nations included in the survey.

In percentage terms, apprehensions grew solidly in every quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarters of 2003, with increases averaging 25%. The trend was slightly negative in the first (-2%) and second (-1%) quarters of 2005 before it picked up for the next three quarters, which averaged gains of 9%.

The image of the U.S. in Canada slipped modestly with the war in Iraq, from a 72% favorability rating before the war to 63% after the conflict, a 9 point drop. But compared with the reaction among some other American allies, this decline in support was relatively modest. U.S. favorability fell 20 points in France and 16 points in Germany over the same period. Similarly, five-in-ten Canadians (54%) still think they should maintain close security and diplomatic ties with the United States.

From 1992 to 1994, and again from 1995 to 1997, changes in consumer confidence were virtually unrelated to movement of the Dow (see chart). But as the stock market boom peaked at decade’s end (1998-2000), the relationship between fluctuations in the stock market and consumer attitudes became much more closely linked. Since 1998, roughly 20% of the change in consumer confidence – as measured on a monthly basis by the University of Michigan – can be attributed to movement in the stock market. Such a linkage had only been apparent once before, at the height of the so-called ‘Reagan recovery’ (1983-85).",good
