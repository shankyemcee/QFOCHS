Far fewer thought conservative Christians and lobbyists would gain under Obama (21% each). As noted, however, smaller shares expect children to gain influence in Trump’s presidency than said that about Obama, Bush or Clinton before they took office. This also is the case in perceptions of how older people will fare.

No more than about a third of Republicans say any of these groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House (33% gays and lesbians, 32% Hispanics). Most Republicans expect that these groups will either gain influence or not be affected by Trump’s presidency. On the other hand, 83% of Democrats expect wealthy people to gain influence in Trump’s presidency, while close to two-thirds say the influence of men (65%) and whites (64%) will grow.

These views are little changed in recent years. There are minor partisan differences in opinions of China. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are somewhat more likely than Democrats and leaners to consider China an adversary. About a quarter of Republicans (26%) rate China as an adversary, compared with a smaller share of Democrats (17%). Roughly a third of Democrats don’t consider China a problem (34%) along with 27% of Republicans. There are age and ideological divisions within the GOP.

As our 2014 polarization study found, Republicans and Democrats increasingly are on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum. Currently, 60% of Democrats and Democratic leaners have consistently liberal or mostly liberal political values, double the share in 1994 (30%) and 11 percentage points higher than in 2004. And the share of Democrats with consistently liberal views has increased from just 5% in 1994 to 13% in 2004 and 27% currently.",unquestionable

Large shares of California’s and Texas’ immigrant populations are from Mexico and South and East Asia. By contrast, about a quarter of immigrants in New York are from the Caribbean (24%) and another 24% are from South and East Asia. Another 19% are from Europe or Canada and Central and South America, each. Only 6% of immigrants in New York are from Mexico.",good
