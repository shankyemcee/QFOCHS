mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3401.png,"Views of Hillary Clinton are more sharply drawn than those of other leading candidates in either political party. As many as 67% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say Clinton is the Democratic candidate who first comes to mind when they hear the word tough and more than half (52%) associate Clinton with the word smart. No other candidate — Democrat or Republican — comes close to Clinton in being linked with each of these traits. Pluralities of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say Rudy Giuliani is the GOP candidate who comes to mind when the words tough and smart are mentioned. But just 39% say Giuliani is the candidate who comes to mind when tough is raised, and 29% link him, more than other leading GOP candidates, with the word smart. Clinton’s own image is largely defined by these two personality traits — just a third or fewer Democratic voters associate her with words such as optimistic, compassionate, energetic and down-to-earth. In fact, more Democratic voters associate the words optimistic, honest, energetic and down-to-earth with Obama than Clinton; larger percentages also associate the word friendly with both Obama and John Edwards than with Clinton.",unquestionable

The public focused intently on Iraq as well. The situation on the ground in Iraq was the most closely followed news story of the week. Roughly three-in-ten Americans (31%) followed Iraq news very closely and 23% listed this as the single news story they followed more closely than any other. One-in-four paid very close attention to Petraeus’s report and 14% said this was their top story of the week. Republicans and Democrats followed the Petraeus story in nearly equal proportions. Independents paid somewhat less attention. Interest in the presidential campaign remained steady in spite of a slight falloff in coverage. Roughly one-in-five Americans (22%) followed campaign news very closely and 14% listed this as their most closely followed story. Coverage of the campaign comprised 5% of the overall newshole.",good

Currently, 54% support a troop withdrawal, which is virtually unchanged from measures dating back to February. In mid-January, following Bush’s speech announcing the surge, there was a modest decline in support for a troop withdrawal; 48% supported bringing the troops home as soon as possible, down five points from a survey conducted earlier in the month (53%). But the proportion favoring a troop withdrawal rebounded to 53% in February. It has remained at about that level since then.",good

One-in-four Americans (24%) said this was the story they followed more closely than any other, greater than twice the number citing any other story listed. The Iraq policy debate in Washington also captured substantial public attention while finishing first (17%) in terms of news coverage. For 9% of Americans, this was the story they followed most closely. The significant amount of coverage devoted to the president’s unannounced visit to Iraq and discussions leading up to the Iraq progress report from Gen. David Petraeus contributed to the story’s prominence in the news.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3405.png,"Hurricanes Felix and Henriette, that simultaneously struck Central America from the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, captured less attention than other storms of the recent past. About one-in-seven (14%) followed the storms very closely last week, compared with far greater numbers who followed Hurricane Wilma in November 2005 (34%, very closely) or Hurricane Katrina (70%) in September 2005, both of which impacted Americans more directly. Questions about the political future of Idaho Sen. Larry Craig following his arrest for disorderly conduct in an airport restroom made him a prominent figure in the news for a second straight week. News about Sen. Craig was followed very closely by 16% of the public, down only slightly from two-in-ten (19%) closely following news about his arrest the week before. A congressional sex scandal in October 2006 involving then-U.S. Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) who sent inappropriate messages to young people, attracted greater interest: At that time, 26% said they were following news about Foley’s actions and his subsequent resignation very closely. German officials last week stopped a terrorist plot by a group of Islamic militants to bomb several locations including Ramstein U.S. military base. One-in-five followed this story very closely and just 6% said it was the story they followed most closely. News about this foiled plot received roughly the same level of public interest as a similar new story in May, when six men were charged with plotting an attack on Fort Dix Army base in New Jersey (19% followed that news very closely).",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3406.png,"Overall views of the presidential candidates are linked with views of their religiosity; those who perceive a candidate as being very religious tend to express the most favorable overall views of each candidate, followed by those who perceive the candidate as being somewhat religious. Those who view candidates as being not too or not at all religious, on the other hand, are much less likely to express favorable views. This pattern holds for Republican and Democratic candidates alike. Among those who describe Giuliani as being very religious, 76% express a favorable view of him, as do 73% of those who view him as being somewhat religious. Among those who say Giuliani is not too or not at all religious, by contrast, just 43% say they hold a favorable view. Similarly, 87% of those who describe Clinton as very religious and 72% of those who describe her as somewhat religious express a favorable view of the New York senator; among those who say she is not too or not at all religious, just 22% express a positive view.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3407.png,"For first two years of the conflict, Americans largely believed that the war effort was going at least fairly well and that the U.S. should not with draw its troops until the situation in Iraq was stable. By October 2005, however, a 53%-majority of the public had come to the view that the U.S. military effort in Iraq was not succeeding. As judgments about the war worsened in the following months and years, calls for withdrawals also trended upward. By July of this year, a Pew poll found nearly six-in-ten Americans saying that the U.S. military effort in Iraq was going not too well or not at all well. Correspondingly, the poll found a 54%-39% margin in favor of bringing U.S. forces home. The obvious question is: given these trend lines, can enough of a case for progress be made by the Bush administration to revive public patience with the war effort literally overnight?",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3408.png,"In part because whites now comprise a smaller share of students in the public schools, white students are now more likely to be exposed to minority students. In 1993-94, fully one-third (34%) of all white students attended a nearly all-white school (this report defines a school as “nearly all-white” if fewer than 5% of the students are non-white). By 2005-06, just one in five white students (21%) was attending a nearly all-white school. The number of nearly all-white public schools fell by 35%, from 25,603 in 1993-94 to 16,769 in 2005-06. But even as the decrease in the white share of the public school population has led to a greater exposure of white students to minority students, it has also led to a diminished exposure of black and Hispanic students to white students. Roughly three-in-ten Hispanic (29%) and black (31%) students attended schools in 2005-06 that were nearly all-minority (by this report’s definition, a “nearly all-minority” school is one in which fewer than 5% of the students are white), and these percentages were both somewhat higher than they had been in 1993-94, when they stood at 25% for Hispanic students and 28% for black students. The number of nearly all-minority public schools almost doubled in this time period, increasing from 5,498 in 1993-94 to 10,135 in 2005-06.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3409.png,"In other news this week, aside from the Vick story, the situation in Iraq and the devastating floods in the Midwest were the public’s most closely followed news stories. A third of Americans (34%) paid very close attention to the situation in Iraq and 17% listed this as their most closely followed news story. Roughly a quarter (27%) followed the floods very closely and 17% listed this as their most closely followed story. Interest in the floods was particularly high in those states that were directly affected — 41% of Midwesterners followed the story very closely. Though Hurricane Dean received slightly more press coverage than the Midwest floods, the public paid closer attention to the floods. Fewer than one-in-five (18%) followed news about the hurricane very closely, 11% listed this as their top news story of the week. Hurricanes that impact the U.S. directly invariably draw a larger audience than do storms, such as Dean, that hit the Caribbean or Mexico. The Iraq policy debate, the most heavily-covered news story of the week, drew the very close attention of 25% of the public. While 12% of the national newshole was devoted to this story, only 8% of the public said this was the story they followed most closely.",good

However, during those same four years the growth of the Latino vote continued to lag well behind the growth of the Latino population. This widening gap is driven by two key demographic trends: a high percentage of the new Hispanics in the population are either too young to vote or ineligible because they are not citizens (Figure 1). About 5.6 million Hispanics voted in the 2006 mid-term election, which historically draws far fewer voters than the quadrennial race for president.

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3412.png,"While the media focused intently last week on the escalating debate over U.S. policy in Iraq, the public took a typical summer hiatus from the major news stories of the week. The Iraq war, rather than the policy debate, was the news story the public focused on most closely, but even attention to the war was down substantially from previous weeks. A quarter of the public paid very close attention to events in Iraq, down from 36% the week before and the lowest level recorded this year. Roughly the same proportion (24%) listed the war as the single news story they followed more closely than any other.

During Libby’s trial less than 10% of the public followed the story very closely, and just 13% paid very close attention to his guilty verdict in March. But 27% of the public paid very close attention to news of Bush’s decision to commute Libby’s sentence. Democrats are more interested than Republicans in this latest chapter (34% vs. 22% followed the Libby news very closely). Roughly one-in-ten Americans listed the Libby story as the one they followed more closely than any other this past week. A quarter of the public (24%) followed news about the 2008 campaign very closely last week, and 10% listed this as their most closely followed story. The campaign was the third most heavily covered news story (8% of the newshole), and the dominant theme of the coverage was the candidates’ second-quarter fundraising totals. As has been the case for much of this year, Democrats paid closer attention than Republicans to campaign news (33% vs. 21% followed very closely). The widespread flooding in Texas and the plains states attracted nearly as much interest as the presidential campaign, though much less news coverage. Roughly one-in-five Americans (21%) followed the floods very closely and 10% listed this as their most closely followed story. The national news media devoted 3% of its overall coverage to this story. The Iraq policy debate heated up again last week, as prominent Republicans continued to speak out against the current administration’s policy.

Fully 51% of all news coverage for the week was devoted to the Virginia Tech shootings and its aftermath. Cable news led the way devoting 76% of its coverage to the story. More than 60% of network television news focused on this story, as did half of all radio news. The public relied mainly on television for news about the shootings: 36% say their main source of information about the story was cable news and another 32% say they relied primarily on network TV news.

In spite of Gonzales’s long-awaited testimony, fewer than 20% of the public paid very close attention to the continuing saga surrounding why eight U.S. attorneys were fired by the Justice Department. This is another story Democrats have consistently followed more closely than Republicans. This past week 27% of Democrats vs. 11% of Republicans paid very close attention to the story. The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was followed very closely by 21% of the public. Though the ruling may have been overshadowed in part by the events at Virginia Tech, public interest was not far below that of other abortion rulings by the Court over the past 10-20 years. When the Court ruled in 2000 that a Nebraska law banning late-term abortion was unconstitutional, only 15% of the public followed the decision very closely. However, 28% of the public paid very close attention to the Court’s deliberations on Pennsylvania abortion restrictions in 1992. The Court’s ruling in the 1989 Webster case attracted much more public interest – 47% followed that decision very closely.

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3437.png,"The Republican Party has traditionally garnered it strongest backing among wealthier voters. But the recent overall decline in Republican Party affiliation nationwide has taken a toll even on GOP support among affluent voters. The latest Pew surveys find Democrats pulling even with Republicans among registered voters with annual family incomes in excess of roughly $135,000 per annum. Overall, while remarkably high voter enthusiasm is undoubtedly the key factor in the Democratic Party’s fundraising success in 2006 and thus far this year, the pool of potential campaign donors is also less tilted toward the GOP today than it has been in the past. Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past 13 years reveals a stark change in the party identification among the wealthiest voters – defined here as those in the top 10% of household incomes. In 1995, the year after the Republicans took control of the House and Senate, there were nearly twice as many Republicans (46%) as Democrats (25%) among the most affluent 10% of registered voters (household incomes of approximately $84,000 or more at the time). By comparison, there are just as many Democrats (31%) as Republicans (32%) among this class of voters today (household incomes of approximately $135,000 or more). As has been the case nationwide, the shifting balance has had more to do with Republican losses than Democratic gains. Within the past two years, Republican Party identification has fallen nine percentage points among the wealthiest voters (from 41% to 32%), while Democratic identification is up just three points. This mirrors the overall pattern nationwide, which shows a sizeable decline in GOP identification, and only modest growth in Democratic Party identification.

Today, half of the public (50%) either identifies as a Democrat or says they lean to the Democratic Party, compared with 35% who align with the GOP. Yet the Democrats’ growing advantage in party identification is tempered by the fact that the Democratic Party’s overall standing with the public is no better than it was when President Bush was first inaugurated in 2001. Instead, it is the Republican Party that has rapidly lost public support, particularly among political independents. Faced with an unpopular president who is waging an increasingly unpopular war, the proportion of Americans who hold a favorable view of the Republican Party stands at 41%, down 15 points since January 2001.

Eleven percent of the public said Smith’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week; 9% of the week’s news coverage was devoted to this topic.

This conflict between compromise and conviction comes to a head when people are asked which kind of leaders they admire most. A slim majority (51%) think more highly of political leaders who make compromises, while 40% most admire those who stick to their positions. The appeal of compromise is linked to a general distaste for ideologues. Majorities dislike political leaders who take liberal positions on nearly all issues (62%) as well as political leaders who take conservative positions on nearly all issues (57%).

Then they’re asked which step of the ladder they feel they’re on at the present time; which step they were on five years ago; and finally, which step they expect to be on five years from now. People aren’t asked to make “better” or “worse” judgments. They’re simply asked to assign numerical ratings to their life at three different points in time. For example, in the 2006 Pew survey (taken this summer), Americans on average gave a 6.1 score to their lives five years ago; a 6.8 score to their present quality of life; and a 7.8 score to the lives they expect to be leading five years from now.

The nationwide GOP congressional vote spiked by more than 9 million votes from 1990, the biggest increase in one party’s vote from one midterm to another since World War II. Meanwhile, the Democratic total declined by 400,000 votes. Another way to produce a big change in Congress is a “one-party collapse,” where a huge number of voters from one of the parties simply sit out the election. That is what happened in 1974, when the dispiriting backdrop of the Watergate scandal led to a nearly 3-million vote falloff in the Republican House vote from 1970. The Democratic vote grew by barely 1 million. But the GOP drop off was so severe that it cost the Republicans nearly 50 House seats. A third way to effect considerable change in Congress is what might be called “unequal gains,” where both parties add votes from the previous midterm but one party gains far more than the other. That happened in 1982, President Reagan’s first midterm, when the Republican congressional vote grew by more than 3 million from 1978, but the Democratic tally swelled by more than 6 million.

That is what happened from 1996 through 2000, as the nationwide congressional vote between the two parties was virtually even each time and the GOP retained control of the House. The GOP’s ultimate ace in the hole is that they approach Nov. 7 as the reigning champions of voter turnout. In 2002, the Republican House vote increased by more than 5 million from 1998, compared with a Democratic gain of barely 2 million.

Even among one of the president’s most supportive constituencies, white evangelical Protestants, Mr. Bush has suffered declines. Given the importance of evangelicals for the electoral successes of the Republican Party over the past several years, how serious is Bush’s slump among this key voter group for the party’s prospects this fall? A new analysis by the Pew Research Center finds that while the president still has the support of a majority of white evangelical Protestants, significantly fewer of them now approve of his performance in office (55% approve, 38% disapprove) than was true at the start of his second term when 72% approved and only 22% disapproved. Indeed, since he began his second term in office, Bush’s approval rating has declined as much among white evangelicals as among the public as a whole. In addition, his personal ratings among evangelicals are also now more negative than ever before – 35% now have an unfavorable view of Bush, compared with 21% of registered evangelical voters in October 2004. Moreover, 45% of evangelicals agreed with the statement that “I am tired of all the problems associated with the Bush administration” – less than a majority but a sizable number nonetheless.",good

By contrast, Republicans match the Democrats among those 40-44 years old (43% Republican, 45% Democrat) – those Americans who came of age during the Reagan years. In fact, the partisan leanings of DotNets today mirror their parents’ generation – many of whom are in the first half of the Baby Boomer cohort.

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3501.png,"The rising political clout of evangelical Christians is not the result of growth in their numbers but rather of their increasing cohesiveness as a key element of the Republican Party.

However, in 1987, white evangelical Protestants were closely divided in their partisan attachments, with 34% identifying as Republicans and 29% as Democrats. The shift toward Republican identification among white evangelicals came in two stages. In the late 1980s, white evangelicals in the South were still mostly wedded to the Democratic Party while evangelicals outside the South were more aligned with the GOP. But over the course of the next decade or so, the GOP made gains among white Southerners generally – and evangelicals in particular – nearly eliminating this regional disparity. Since the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Republican identification has grown among both Southern and non-Southern evangelicals. Today, Republicans outnumber Democrats among white evangelicals by more than two-to-one (51%-22%), and hold a 63%-29% lead when partisan “leaners” are included. Although Republican Party identification among both evangelicals and non-evangelicals increased slightly following the September 11 attacks, it has since retreated to pre-9/11 levels for non-evangelicals. Among evangelicals, it has continued to rise. Today, white evangelicals make up 22% of the population, and constitute nearly four out of every ten (39%) Republicans.",good

The incomes of unauthorized migrants do not show the same pattern of increase with longer durations of residence. For those in the U.S. more than 10 years, family incomes are only about one-sixth higher than the shorter-term unauthorized ($29,900 versus $25,700) and remain 35% below the incomes of native families. The relatively low incomes of unauthorized migrants in the country for more than 10 years most likely reflects a lack of opportunities for economic mobility among those who remain in an unauthorized status. Many unauthorized migrants are able to become legal immigrants after 10 or more years in the U.S. Those who are left as unauthorized may not be able to take advantage of a range of jobs available; that is, they may be “stuck” in lower-paying jobs.",good

This pattern undoubtedly reflects the availability of coverage through the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in recent years. Children of immigrants are less likely to be covered by health insurance than children of natives, reflecting their higher levels of poverty and the lack of insurance on the part of their parents. Here again, the status of the child has a separate effect on coverage as U.S.-born children of immigrants are more likely to have insurance than children who are immigrants themselves. Legal immigrant children, while having high levels without insurance (25%), are much more likely to be covered than unauthorized children (59%).

Other emotional responses to the war have also remained stable in recent days, including sadness, fright, and fatigue.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3598.png,"There are notable demographic, educational and political differences over the war evident in the survey. Substantial majorities of men in every age group ­ no fewer than seven-in-ten ­ think it was the right decision to go to war. Opinion among women varies widely by age, with the oldest and youngest women least likely to support the war. Only about half of women age 75 and older ­ and a similar proportion of those below the age of 25 (52%)­ back the decision to go to war. Among women in all other age groups, at least six-in-ten agree with that decision. The gender gap in support for war in Iraq is especially large among the youngest and oldest respondents. In the youngest group ­ ages 18-24 ­ just over half of women (52%) say the U.S. made the right decision in going to war, while 82% of men feel this way (a gap of 30 points). And among those ages 25-29, the gap is 21 points (men 85%, women 64%). At the other end of the age spectrum, there also is a large gender gap (23 points). More than seven-in-ten men (73%) age 75 and older say the U.S. made the right decision, compared with only 50% of women. But unlike the youngest women, 44% of whom think war was the wrong decision, older women are no more opposed to military action than their male counterparts. Women age 75 and older are simply much less likely than men to express an opinion about the war at all.",good

Overall, the interviews by Sunday and Monday found about as many people thinking the war effort was going just fairly well (41%) as opposed to very well (45%). Only 8% went as far as to say the war effort was not going well.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3600.png,"The Global Attitudes study correlated views on religion with annual per capita income and found that wealthier nations tend to place less importance on religion — with the exception of the United States. This is seen most clearly in Asia, where publics in the two wealthiest nations surveyed — Japan and South Korea — are far less likely to cite religion as personally important than those in poorer nations of the region. The lone exception is Vietnam, however, where just 24% of the public view religion as very important. (Questions on the personal importance of religion were not permitted in China, and were deemed too sensitive to ask in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon.)",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3601.png,"But partisan divisions over President Bush’s performance, which diminished dramatically following the terrorist attacks, are once again as large as they were during his first days in office. While 88% of Republicans are happy with the president’s job performance, 58% of political independents and just 34% of Democrats agree. This is comparable to an April 2001 Pew Research Center survey in which Bush won the approval of 87% of Republicans, 56% of independents, and 36% of Democrats.",good
mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3602.png,"The latest Pew Research Center survey of 1,919 adults conducted Sept. 5-10 (with an additional poll of 1,150 conducted Sept. 12-16) shows there has been virtually no movement in the congressional ballot all year. The generic House ballot stands at the same statistical dead heat as in June, with Democrats holding a thin 46%-44% edge among registered voters. When the sample is narrowed to likely voters, the Republicans lead 47%-46%. While the congressional poll did not cover the period of Bush’s speeches on Sept. 11 and at the U.N., neither his soaring job approval marks early this year nor his declining ratings in late summer have significantly affected the congressional race. In fact, presidential approval has no greater impact on the generic ballot than it did four years ago.",good

In 2000 the average full-time, year-round Hispanic worker earned about $31,000, or about 60 percent of what non-Hispanic whites earned. The pay of whites was up so sharply that the overall pay gap between white and Hispanic workers increased by $7,000 for men and $5,000 for women.",good

Fully one-in-three Americans now go online for news at least once a week, compared to 20% in 1998. And 15% say they receive daily reports from the Internet, up from 6% two years ago. At the same time, regular viewership of network news has fallen from 38% to 30% over this period, while local news viewership has fallen from 64% to 56%.",good

The long-term impact of this period in American history upon the young people of that time is clearly evident today. The nearly 40-year history of public opinion about the state of the nation and trust in government makes it possible to observe how particular generations have changed or maintained their views over this time period.",unquestionable
