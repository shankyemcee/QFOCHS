Hispanic voters this year make up an even larger share of the state ’s registered voters than in past years , but the profile of the Latino electorate has shifted over the past decade or so , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state voter registration data . Due to the state ’s large Cuban voting bloc , the Latino vote had been reliably Republican . For example , President George W. Bush won both the Hispanic vote and the state in 2004 . But 2008 represented a tipping point : More Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans , and the gap has only widened since then . This has led to the growing influence of Democrats among the state ’s Hispanic voters in 2008 and 2012 , two presidential elections in which Barack Obama carried both Hispanics and the state . At the same time , the number of Latino registered voters in Florida who indicate no party affiliation has also grown rapidly during this time , and by 2012 had surpassed Republican registrations . Among all Floridians , registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in 2016 . This is due in part to Hispanics , who accounted for 88 % of growth in the number of registered Democrats between 2006 and 2016 . During this time , the number of Hispanic registered voters increased by 61 % , while the number of Hispanics identifying as Democrats increased by 83 % and those having no party affiliation increased by 95 % . The number of Hispanic Republican registered voters has grown too – but much more slowly ( just 16 % ) . As a result , among Hispanic registered voters in 2016 , 678,000 were registered as Democrats , 610,000 indicated no party affiliation and 479,000 were registered as Republicans .

Those with more ideologically consistent views are more likely to have learned about the election than those who had ideologically mixed views . Of those with mixed views , 14 % did n’t learn about the election from any source , which is higher than those who are more consistently liberal or conservative .

While the nation ’s 156 million non - Hispanic white eligible voters in 2016 far outnumber the 70 million eligible voters that are racial or ethnic minorities , their growth lags that of minority groups . As a result , the non - Hispanic white share of the electorate has fallen from 71 % in 2012 to 69 % . There are 10.7 million more eligible voters today than there were in 2012 . More than two - thirds of net growth in the U.S. electorate during this time has come from racial and ethnic minorities . Hispanics , blacks , Asians and other minorities had a net increase of 7.5 million eligible voters , compared with a net increase of 3.2 million among non - Hispanic white eligible voters . The growth among non - Hispanic white eligible voters has been slower than among racial or ethnic minorities in large part because they are overrepresented in deaths due to an aging population . Non - Hispanic whites make up 69 % of U.S. eligible voters , but accounted for 76 % of all eligible voters who died ( 6.6 million of 8.7 million ) between 2012 and 2016 . Another reason growth has lagged among non - Hispanic white eligible voters is that they ’re underrepresented among young people born in the U.S. who turn 18 – the group most responsible for the nation ’s growth in eligible voters . Non - Hispanic whites accounted for 57 % of the 16 million new eligible voters who turned 18 between 2012 and 2016 .

Registered voters who supported Trump for president favored a “ just the facts ” approach by more than two - to - one , with only 29 % saying the news media should add interpretation . Clinton supporters , on the other hand , are evenly split on the issue , with half against interpretation and half favoring it . This may be linked to a perception among Republicans that coverage of their candidate had been too tough .

Although majorities of both groups see inequality as a very big problem , Christians are especially likely to hold this view .

For a national cellphone sample , this reduces the estimated net coverage rate of U.S. adults from about 91 % to 83 % . These net rates are based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s January to June 2015 National Health Interview Survey that 3 % of adults have no telephone and another 6 % have a landline but no cellphone . For national RDD surveys of adults , the inclusion of a landline sample substantially mitigates the reduction in coverage from excluding flagged - inactive numbers ( from 97 % coverage to 93 % , rather than 83 % ) . While excluding flagged - inactive cellphones reduces the survey coverage rate and disproportionately excludes hard - to - reach demographic groups , it does not appear to have a meaningful effect on bias , at least for public opinion surveys . Adults with cellphones erroneously flagged as inactive do differ systematically on several dimensions from those with flagged - active cellphones , as described above , but they constitute too small a fraction of the population to meaningfully move estimates . In the survey , 2 % of all cellphone sample interviews and 1 % of the combined ( cellphone plus landline ) sample interviews were with adults reached on numbers erroneously flagged as inactive using the activity flag .",Describe some details about Excluding flagged-inactive cellphone numbers reduces sample coverage of U.S. adults?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1106.png,Estimated % of total vote cast,"In 2012 , more than 46 million voters – almost 36 % of the total – cast ballots in some manner other than at a traditional polling place on Election Day , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state and federal election data .

Those findings are broadly in line with the Census Bureau ’s post - election surveys , which ask people whether they voted on or before Election Day and whether they did so in person or by mail . In 1996 , the first year those questions were asked , 10.5 % of voters reported using what the Census calls an “ alternative ” method – either voting by mail or in person before Election Day .

At the time , relatively few anticipated the size or demographic impact of the post-1965 immigration flow ( Gjelten , 2015 ) . In absolute numbers , the roughly 59 million immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between 1965 and 2015 exceed those who arrived in the great waves of European - dominated immigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Between 1840 and 1889 , 14.3 million immigrants came to the U.S. , and between 1890 and 1919 , an additional 18.2 million arrived ( see Table 1 for details ) . As a result of its changed makeup and rapid growth , new immigration since 1965 has altered the nation ’s racial and ethnic composition . In 1965 , 84 % of Americans were non - Hispanic whites . By 2015 , that share had declined to 62 % . Meanwhile , the Hispanic share of the U.S. population rose from 4 % in 1965 to 18 % in 2015 .

The foreign - born share of Salvadorans , for example , fell from 76 % in 2000 to 59 % in 2013 — the largest percentage point decline of any of the six largest Hispanic origin groups . Similarly , Dominicans , Guatemalans , and Colombians all had decreases of over 13 percentage points in their foreign - born shares over the same period . Mexicans , the nation ’s largest Hispanic origin group , also saw a decline , though it was only 8 percentage points since 2000 . A decline is underway among smaller Hispanic origin groups , too ( see Appendix Table A1 ) . Overall , the share of the Hispanic population that is foreign born has decreased from 40 % in 2000 to 35 % in 2013 . Despite falling immigrant shares across all Latino origin groups , fast Latino population growth has led to continued growth in the number of Latino immigrants ( though growth has slowed in recent years ) . Among all Latinos , there were 14.1 million immigrants in 2000 . By 2005 , that number reached 16.8 million , and by 2013 , there were 19 million Latino immigrants in the U.S. The same pattern is present among all Latino origin groups , though for three — Ecuadorians , Mexicans and Nicaraguans — the number of immigrants has declined since 2010 ( for details , see Appendix Table A2 ) .",mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1488.png,FIGURE2 Puerto Rican Views of Identity % saying they most often describe themselues as...

( For background see “ Human Enhancement : The Scientific and Ethical Dimensions of Striving for Perfection . ” ) The survey data show several patterns surrounding Americans ’ wariness about these developments . First , there are strong differences in views about using these technologies for enhancement depending on how religious people are . In general , the most religious are the most wary about potential enhancements . For example , those who score high on a three - item index of religious commitment1 are more likely than those who are lower in religious commitment to say all three types of enhancement – gene editing to give babies a lifetime with much reduced risk of disease , brain chip implants to give people much improved cognitive abilities and transfusions with synthetic blood to give people much improved physical capacities – would be meddling with nature and crossing a line that should not be crossed . Americans who have lower levels of religious commitment are more inclined to see the potential use of these techniques as just the continuation of a centuries - old quest by humans to try to better themselves .",What kind of enhancements can be made and what are their benefits?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1206.png,Women make up about a third of current U.S. ambassadors,"Currently , about a third ( 36 % ) of assigned American ambassadors are women .

There were similar differences by political party on this question , with more than twice as many Democrats ( 39 % ) as Republicans ( 17 % ) saying that having more women in high political office would improve the lives of women , while independents ( 28 % ) ranked in the middle . In 2015 , there were 104 women in Congress , a record number representing 19 % of all Senate and House seats . There was no overall consensus among the public in our survey on what holds women back from gaining top elective offices , though women were far more likely than men to cite societal and institutional factors as major reasons . About half ( 47 % ) of women said that a major reason there are not more women in top political offices is that female candidates are held to higher standards than men , compared with 28 % of men who said so . Four - in - ten women ( 41 % ) , compared with three - in - ten men ( 31 % ) , said that a major reason for the lack of women in top political offices is that many Americans are n’t ready to elect a woman to a higher office . And 33 % of women , compared with 21 % of men , said that females getting less support from party leaders is a major reason . Relatively small shares of men ( 15 % ) and women ( 18 % ) said that family responsibilities are a major reason that fewer women hold elective offices . There were generational differences among women in our survey on the attributes that a woman brings to political office . Younger women were less likely to give female leaders an edge over male leaders , and instead were more likely to say men and women are equally likely to possess certain traits . For example , when it comes to working out compromises , 33 % of Millennial women and 37 % of Generation X women said women are better than men , compared with about half of women from the Baby Boomer ( 47 % ) and Silent ( 50 % ) generations who said so . Asked about which gender is better at working to improve Americans ’ quality of life , only 22 % of Millennial women and 24 % of Gen X women said female leaders are better , compared with 39 % of Baby Boomer women and 35 % of Silent generation women who said so .",How are men still being favored by the gender gap?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1261.png,"Frequent ride-hailing users less likely to own or drive a car, more likely to muse a range of other transit options % ineach group who","Some 3 % of American adults use ride - hailing apps on a daily or weekly basis , and around two - thirds of these regular ride - hailing users indicate that they own a car or regularly drive a personal vehicle . Although this means that a majority of these regular ride - hailing users are car owners / drivers , they are significantly less likely to own or drive a car than either occasional ride - hailing users or Americans who do not use ride - hailing at all . Yet although they are less dependent on personal vehicle ownership , these regular ride - hailing users rely heavily on a wide range of personal transportation options that go well beyond ride - hailing alone – such as taking public transit , walking or riding a bike , or even using traditional taxi services . To be sure , this trend carries a strong geographic component : For Americans who live far from urban centers , a personal vehicle might be the only available option to get from one place to another . But for those with the option of doing so , ride - hailing apps can serve as one element among many in a network of transportation options that can help reduce users ’ reliance on personal vehicle ownership .",How willing are Americans to be car owners nowadays?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1599.png,General Support for TPP thing?

And , as with many issues in the U.S. , there is a partisan divide on support for TPP . Overall , 49 % of Americans say that TPP would be a good thing for their country , while 29 % think it would be a bad thing . When the survey was administered in April and May , the debate over giving Obama fast - track authority — which would enhance his ability to negotiate TPP without fear of it being modified by Congress — had not yet gained the full attention of Americans . Consequently , 12 % volunteered that they had not heard enough about TPP to make a judgment , and a further 9 % did not answer the question . In general , Americans see free trade agreements as good for the country . However , support for this free trade agreement is much more robust in most other TPP nations surveyed . This includes two - thirds or more of Vietnamese ( 89 % good thing ) , Peruvians ( 70 % ) and Chileans ( 67 % ) . And at least half or more in Mexico ( 61 % ) , Japan ( 53 % ) , Australia ( 52 % ) and Canada ( 52 % ) also support the deal .

Together , these practices represent three of the Five Pillars of Islam — rituals all Muslims are expected to observe . Roughly half ( 52 % ) of Israeli Muslims pray five times a day , compared with a median of 63 % among Muslims in other Middle Eastern and North African countries polled , including 83 % in Iraq . Jordan and Egypt are the only countries polled where the proportion of Muslims who pray all five times stands at roughly half – 54 % and 53 % respectively . Similarly , while a majority of Israeli Muslims give a portion of their accumulated wealth to charities or the needy ( a practice known as zakat ) , this is a significantly smaller proportion than is found among Muslims elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa . A regional median of 79 % of Muslims practice zakat , with rates of observance as high as nine - in - ten in Morocco ( 92 % ) . In the case of fasting during Ramadan , Israel ’s Muslims also tend to be less observant . While 83 % of Israeli Muslims do observe the ritual fast from dawn until dusk , this is a significantly smaller percentage than in Muslim - majority countries such as Morocco ( 98 % ) and Tunisia ( 96 % ) .

Indeed , a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the General Social Survey ( GSS ) finds that between 1972 and 1974 , an average of 36 % of women and 26 % of men reported attending religious services at least once a week – a 10 - percentage - point gap . After initially widening to 13 points in the mid-1980s , the gap began to shrink in the late 1980s through the 1990s . During this period , weekly attendance at religious services declined among all Americans , but it declined more among women than men . As a result , by the early 2010s , the gender gap in attendance had narrowed to just 6 points , with 28 % of women and 22 % of men saying they attend religious services at least weekly .",How's the gender gap when it comes to religious attending?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1264.png,"Since the 1970s, the share of women working full time has increased as the share working in the home has declined Shares of women ages 25 64 by work status 60 % Working full-time At home","One theory is that the decline in women ’s attendance at services – and subsequent narrowing of the attendance gender gap – is connected to changes in women ’s labor force participation . In the mid-1970s , three - in - ten U.S. women ages 25 to 64 were working full time in the labor force . Today , just over half of women in that age group work full time , compared with around 70 % of men . Scholars have found that in the U.S. and other predominantly Christian countries , women working in the labor force attend religious services less often than women outside the labor force and show a smaller gender gap with men . However , it should be noted that the fastest increase in women ’s full - time employment during this period occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s , during which time the gender gap on religious service attendance actually widened somewhat . In the following years ( mid 1980s through the late 1990s ) , the share of women working full time continued to increase and women ’s worship attendance declined – but it did so for women inside and outside the labor force , and across occupational categories including managers , professionals and retail and service workers .",What about labor force participation and gender differences?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1602.png,Fewer in Western Europe Say U.S. Respects Personal Freedoms Percent saying the government of the USS respects the personal freedomsof its people,"In Germany , France and the United Kingdom , fewer people believe the U.S. government respects personal freedoms than was the case in 2008 , the final year of the George W.

For roughly 15 years , independent studies suggested that the answer to that question was generally “ no ” if the goal was to make accurate population estimates.1 Over time , though , researchers and sample vendors have developed technologies and statistical techniques aimed at improving the representativeness of online nonprobability surveys . Several recent case studies suggest a future ( some would argue a present ) in which researchers need not have an expensive , probability - based sample to make accurate population estimates . Nearly all of the questions ( 52 ) were also asked on waves of the Center ’s probability - based American Trends Panel ( ATP ) , which is conducted predominantly online but features mail response for adults who do not have internet access . The samples were evaluated using a range of metrics , including estimated bias on 20 full sample survey estimates for which high quality government benchmarks are available , estimated bias for major demographic subgroup estimates , and predictive accuracy of four different regression models . Among the most important findings of this study are the following : There is also evidence , though less consistent , that online nonprobability samples tilt more toward certain lifestyles . Most of the samples have disproportionately high shares of adults who do not have children , live alone , collect unemployment benefits and are low - income . In some respects , this squares with a stereotype one might imagine for people who find time to participate in online survey panels , perhaps akin to a part - time job . On other dimensions , however , the online nonprobabilty estimates are either quite accurate ( e.g. , have a driver ’s license or length of time at current residence ) or the biases are not in a consistent direction across the samples ( e.g. , daily smoking ) .",Describe what are the factors affecting quality of data ?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1278.png,Modest changes in public's overall view of ACA since its passage in 2010 % saying they of the 20010 health care law,"The public ’s views of the Affordable Care Act , which were evenly divided following the Supreme Court ’s ruling last summer upholding a key section of the law , are again more negative than positive .
