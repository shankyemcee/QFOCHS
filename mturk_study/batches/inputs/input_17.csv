One of the largest gender gaps was on the ability to work out compromises : 41 % of women compared with 27 % of men said women are better at this .

For many , the prospect of a Clinton presidency may have influenced their responses to this “ hypothetical ” question . Democratic women ( 69 % ) were the most likely to say they hoped a female U.S. president would be elected in their lifetimes , followed by Democratic men ( 46 % ) and independent women ( 45 % ) .

By 2055 , the U.S. will not have a single racial or ethnic majority . Much of this change has been ( and will be ) driven by immigration . Nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in the past 50 years , mostly from Latin America and Asia . Today , a near - record 14 % of the country ’s population is foreign born compared with just 5 % in 1965 . Over the next five decades , the majority of U.S. population growth is projected to be linked to new Asian and Hispanic immigration . American attitudes about immigration and diversity are supportive of these changes for the most part . More Americans say immigrants strengthen the country than say they burden it , and most say the U.S. ’s increasing ethnic diversity makes it a better place to live . Asia has replaced Latin America ( including Mexico ) as the biggest source of new immigrants to the U.S. In a reversal of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history , net migration flows from Mexico to the U.S. turned negative between 2009 and 2014 , as more Mexicans went home than arrived in the U.S. And after rising steadily since 1990 , the unauthorized immigrant population has leveled off in recent years , falling to 11.3 million in 2014 from a high of 12.2 million in 2007 . Meanwhile , Asians are now the only major racial or ethnic group whose numbers are rising mainly because of immigration . And while African immigrants make up a small share of the U.S. immigrant population , their numbers are also growing steadily – roughly doubling every decade since 1970 .",What were the benefits perceived by those who sought personal learning in recent months?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/9179.png,Most Pakistanis believe government is making progress against extremists,"Additionally , in the spring of 2015 , Pakistanis were confident that the government was making progress in the fight against extremists .

Generational analysis allows for these comparative snapshots , but it also lets researchers track what happens as these cohorts age .",describe the married details in 2014?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10122.png,"Generation Gaps: Silents, Boomers See Themselves in a More Positive Light","The survey also asked if a number of descriptions applied to the people of their generation . Silents are far more likely than people in younger age cohorts to view their own generation in a positive light . Large majorities of Silents say the people of their generation are hard - working ( 83 % ) , responsible ( 78 % ) , patriotic ( 73 % ) , self - reliant ( 65 % ) , moral ( 64 % ) , willing to sacrifice ( 61 % ) and compassionate ( 60 % ) .",tell about the generation gap?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10091.png,"Nation's Poor Population Is Less Southern, More Urban Than in 1960 Share of nation's impoverished population BY COUNTY POPULATION","But perhaps just as striking is that the geographic distribution of the poor has changed dramatically , too . A new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that the South continues to be home to many of America ’s poor , though to a lesser degree than a half - century ago . In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South . By 2010 , that share had dropped to 41 % . Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period . As rural areas , such as in the Midwest , have become less impoverished since the 1960s , those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall . At the same time , urban centers have gained in total population and hold a greater share of the U.S. population overall .",1960 how much Americans lived in the South?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/11667.png,Fewer Dems Voting For Obama than in 2010; Reps Still Voting Against Him,"Support for Obama is driving the vote of fewer Democrats today than in 2010 . In the current survey , 38 % of voters who plan to support the Democratic candidate in their district say they consider their vote as “ for ” Obama . Four years ago , far more Democratic voters ( 53 % ) said this .",mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/11683.png,Who will turn out to vote in November? A look at likely voters through the lens of the Political Typology,"Our most recent panel survey , conducted Sept. 9 - Oct. 3 with 3,154 adults — including 2,150 likely voters — checks back in with Americans interviewed for the political typology study . It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % ,   respectively ,   likely to turn out . Steadfast Conservatives are staunch critics of government and are socially conservative . Business Conservatives prefer limited government , but are far more moderate on social issues than Steadfast Conservatives and favor immigration reform . We estimate that these two groups constitute only 22 % of the general public , but because they are so engaged with politics , these groups make up 38 % of the likely electorate . On the left , the Solid Liberals are solidly Democratic in their vote preference ( 93 % ) among likely voters and are uniformly liberal across nearly every realm – government , the economy , business , the environment and foreign policy , as well as on social issues . But they are somewhat less likely than the two conservative groups to vote ; we forecasted that 54 % of them will turn out to vote .",mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/11687.png,Religious affiliation of Indian Americans,"That survey found that about half of Indian Americans ( 51 % ) identify as Hindus , while 5 % identify as Sikhs and 2 % as Jains ( two other religious groups that also observe Diwali ) . Most of the rest are Christians ( 18 % ) , Muslims ( 10 % ) or people unaffiliated with any religion ( 10 % ) ."
