Concern about jobs has risen even more sharply . The 82 % who rate improving the job situation as a top priority represents a 21 - point jump from 61 % a year ago . Of the 20 issues people were asked to rate in both January 2008 and January 2009 , five have slipped significantly in importance as attention to the economy has surged .

The percentage rating illegal immigration as a top priority has fallen from 51 % to 41 % over the past year , and reducing crime has fallen by a similar amount ( from 54 % to 46 % ) .

Political scientists ( and practical politicians ) long have recognized that voter turnout surges in presidential election years and falls off in midterm elections . In the 2008 presidential election , for example , nearly 59 % of estimated eligible voters voted in that year ’s House elections . Two years later for the midterms , only about 41 % of eligible voters went to the polls . ( We estimated eligible voters in each district from 2006 through 2012 using data from the Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , and obtained vote totals for every House race from the House Clerk ’s office . Our analysis excluded a handful of races in which unopposed candidates were n’t listed on the ballot . ) You might think there ’d be some relationship between how competitive a given election is and turnout . A race where victory could go either way might spur more interest and rev up get - out - the - vote efforts from both sides ; a race where one candidate is a prohibitive favorite could lead many people to conclude there ’s no point in heading out to vote . But our analysis shows little , if any , correlation between a House election ’s competitiveness ( measured by the winner ’s victory margin ) and turnout . In the Tea Party year of 2010 , for example , overall turnout in House races was 40.7 % of estimated eligible voters . That year , the nation ’s highest turnout was in Wisconsin ’s 5th District , where 62.4 % of estimated eligible voters cast ballots and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner cruised to a 42 - percentage - point victory . The nation ’s tightest race in 2010 was in Illinois ’ 8th District , where Republican Joe Walsh edged Democrat Melissa Bean by just 290 votes ; 41.7 % of estimated eligible voters cast ballots in that contest . ( The lowest turnout rate in 2010 , 19.5 % , came in Texas ’ 16th District , which Democrat Silvestre Reyes won by a comfortable 21.5 percentage points . )",Describe the Tea Party's participation in 2010 in the Camara disputes?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/336.png,Local TV stations profit from political advertising dollars during the midterm election season.,"The upcoming midterm elections might be underwhelming for many Americans , but it could shape up to be one of the most profitable for local TV stations – one of the sources Americans turn to most for news about politics . Local TV has been receiving the largest portion of political media spending for at least a decade , but the share it consumes and the total dollars reaped continue to grow . Through mid - October , local TV stations have captured 95 % of the television political ad spending , which includes spot , national cable , national network broadcast ( local cable political ad spending is not part of this analysis ) . In 2012 , during the last presidential elections , local TV stations captured 92 % of total political TV ad spending , based on the same analysis . From January to mid - October 2014 , total political ad spending for local TV was about $ 1.3 billion , according to a Television Bureau of Advertising ( TVB ) analysis of Kantar CMAG data . Those dollars , though , are far from evenly distributed across the states . More than half of that has gone to 10 states with the most competitive races ( Florida , California , Texas , Colorado , Illinois , Michigan , Georgia , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and New York ) . In Florida , a state with a closely - watched governor ’s race pitting incumbent Rick Scott against former Republican - now Democrat Charlie Crist , the political ad spending has topped $ 100 million dollars , the highest among all states .",Describe political ad spending in Florida?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/338.png,"How Americans, Europeans See the Economic Future","We looked at two measures of consumer confidence : the University of Michigan ’s Index of Consumer Expectations ( part of its broader monthly surveys of consumer sentiment ) and the European Consumer Confidence Indicator , produced by Eurostat , the EU ’s statistical research office .

The UMich index is derived from three questions on personal financial expectations a year from now and expectations for the U.S. economy one and five years out , relative to a 1966 base year . The EU metric is the average of the answers to four questions covering expectations for household finances , general economic conditions , unemployment and personal savings over the next 12 months .

A new Pew Research Center analysis finds pronounced differences in the ratio between men and women living in the largest U.S. metro areas , especially when it comes to singles who have an attractive characteristic : a job . Nationwide , single young men outnumber their female counterparts . The overall male - to - female ratio is 115:100 among single adults ages 25 to 34 .

For women seeking a male partner with a job , our analysis found that San Jose , Calif. , tops the list among large metro areas , with 114 single employed men for every 100 single women . Among all single young adults , there were 141 men for every 100 women in this area .

This finding of a dramatic increase in English - language ability from one generation of Hispanics to the next emerges from a new analysis of six Pew Hispanic Center surveys conducted this decade among a total of more than 14,000 Latino adults . The surveys show that fewer than one - in - four ( 23 % ) Latino immigrants reports being able to speak English very well . However , fully 88 % of their U.S.-born adult children report that they speak English very well . Among later generations of Hispanic adults , the figure rises to 94 % .

By this yardstick , the recovery from the Great Recession is bypassing most of the nation ’s households . The current “ recovery ” is also the most negative for household income during any post - recession period in the past four decades . However , the failure of household incomes to regain ground two years into an economic recovery is not without precedent . U.S. households also experienced lingering losses during the recoveries from the 1990 - 91 and 2001 recessions — median household income fell by 1.3 % in the first two years following the end of each of those two recessions .

Unfortunately , the CPS does not ask its respondents whether they personally access the internet using a cellular data plan . This CPS estimate lines up closely with the 2018 National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) , which estimates that 79 % of U.S. adults would say yes to a very simple question , “ Do you use the internet ? ” Another potential measurement wrinkle comes from the various types of activities people can engage in on the internet . Some might equate “ using the internet ” with web browsing alone , inadvertently excluding email . Someone who only checks their email via a standalone email client or a mobile app could potentially say they do n’t use the internet . Fortunately , the NHIS also asks respondents whether they send or receive emails . If we combine this with the previous estimate , we get a slight uptick to 81 % of U.S. adults who either “ use the internet ” or use email . While these varied approaches to measuring internet use can be bewildering , they all tell roughly the same story when viewed over time .
