Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border more than doubled between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 but remained below historical highs . There were 851,508 apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year ( October 2018 - September 2019 ) , a 115 % increase from the previous fiscal year and the highest total in 12 years . Still , the total remained far below the 1,643,679 apprehensions recorded in 2000 , the peak year . And apprehensions regularly exceeded 1 million per fiscal year during the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s ."

In 2016 , an estimated 5.3 million of the nearly 17 million U.S. households living in poverty were headed by a Millennial , compared with 4.2 million headed by a Gen Xer and 5.0 million headed by a Baby Boomer . The relatively high number of Millennial households in poverty partly reflects the fact that the poverty rate among households headed by a young adult has been rising over the past half century while dramatically declining among households headed by those 65 and older . In addition , Millennials are more racially and ethnically diverse than the other adult generations , and a greater share of Millennial households are headed by minorities , who tend to have higher poverty rates . Millennial heads of households are also more likely to be unmarried , which is associated with higher poverty . About half of cohabiting - couple households are headed by a Millennial .

By 2016 , Millennials were heads of 4.2 million of an estimated 8.3 million cohabiting - couple households .

Four - in - ten Americans followed news about the fires very closely , making it the fourth most closely followed news story of the year . The only stories that have attracted a larger audience this year were rising gas prices in May , the Virginia Tech shootings in April , and the Minnesota bridge collapse in August . Nearly half of the public ( 46 % ) listed the California fires as the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week . Comprising 38 % of the national newshole , the wildfires became the second most heavily covered news story of 2007 .

Many also associate selfishness with Muslims , although India is the only country where a majority does so . Non - Muslims are less likely to rate Muslims as greedy or immoral — in France for instance , only 10 % say Muslims are greedy and just 18 % label Muslims as immoral . The data on Muslim attitudes towards Westerners also reveal a variety of negative views . In the five majority Muslim countries , as well as Nigeria , at least 40 % of Muslims characterize Westerners as arrogant , violent , greedy , and immoral ; meanwhile , relatively few say Westerners are generous or honest . Muslims in these countries are also especially likely to say Westerners are selfish — in all six countries , majorities suggest selfishness is common among people in Europe and the United States . Negative assessments of Westerners are fairly common across all six of these countries , although they are slightly more prevalent in Jordan and Indonesia .

By April 2016 , near the end of the Democratic primaries , Clinton was named the first choice of 46 % of Democratic voters in an open - ended question about their nomination preferences . But only 29 % had consistently named her their first choice in December 2015 , March 2016 and April 2016 . And even fewer , just 15 % , had consistently named her their first choice going all the way back to March 2015 . This fluidity was n’t confined to Clinton supporters : Sanders was the top choice of 37 % of Democratic voters in April 2016 , but only about half of these supporters ( 20 % of all Democratic voters ) consistently backed Sanders across the three primary - season surveys .

The island ’s declining population is not a new trend . Indeed , Puerto Rico has been experiencing a net population loss since at least 2005 , a year before its recession began . However , the trend has been accelerating since 2010 as the U.S. mainland ’s economy has rebounded from the Great Recession even as the island ’s economy has remained mired in a recession . More recently , the Puerto Rican government has seen its tax revenues decline and , barred by U.S. law from filing for bankruptcy , it may run out of cash in November .

Adoption of the Web for data collection is occurring in all sectors of the industry from the U.S. Census Bureau , which now allows respondents to take the American Community Survey on the Web , to political polling , where the cost and difficulty of targeting phone calls geographically is prompting more organizations to rely on online polls , to the marketing research community , which has moved virtually all consumer surveys to the Web . One key factor that has made this shift possible is the fact that the vast majority of Americans now use the internet . Pew Research Center telephone surveys have documented the rise in internet adoption , which has grown from 14 % of the U.S. adult population in 1996 to 89 % today .

As proposed by Mollie Orshansky in 1965 , the U.S. poverty line is defined as an income of three times the cost of the thrifty food plan ( meaning food would take up 33 % of a family ’s income at the poverty line ) . By that standard , the U.S. poverty line in 2011 was $ 15.77 per day per capita for a household of four ( the precise line varies by household size and composition ) . Compared with the food budget for an urban Indian family at the poverty line , the food budget in the U.S. is 3.5 times higher – $ 5.07 vs. India ’s $ 1.44 . The overall U.S. poverty - line budget is five times greater than India ’s , $ 15.77 vs. $ 3.09 ."

Besides these four activities , other smartphone apps were also popular . Three - quarters of smartphone owners reported using their phone for social media , while 60 % took pictures or a video , and more than half ( 55 % ) got news on their smartphone at least once over the course of the one - week survey period .

These trends are analyzed with regard to the national origins of the unauthorized immigrants , focusing on those from Mexico . Then I turn to a discussion of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. labor force and changing patterns over time . Finally , I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants are represented with a discussion of differences across the states . This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last November ( Passel and Cohn , 2014 ) and a new report we are releasing today ( Passel and Cohn , 2015 ) . The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990 . After 2007 , the trend changed abruptly and the numbers dropped dramatically by about 1 million over the next two years to 11.3 million in 2009 as the number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving plummeted and large numbers left the country . Since 2009 , the national unauthorized immigrant population has remained essentially unchanged as arrivals and departures have come into rough balance . ( See Figure 1 . ) From 1990 to 2007 , the number of unauthorized immigrants increased in every state , but growth was slower in the six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations than in the rest of the nation as a whole . California , the state with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in all years , experienced the largest numerical growth , but its 88 % increase from 1990 to 2007 was slower than that of other large states and nearly all smaller states . As a group , the other five largest states ( Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , New York and Texas ) experienced growth in their unauthorized immigrant population at the national average of 250 % over the period . Meanwhile , the unauthorized immigrant population in the rest of the country increased almost sevenfold , from 700,000 in 1990 to 4.7 million in 2007 ."

Also , the attitudes of Hispanic immigrants were much more positive than those of native - born Latinos . In addition to the immigrants ’ basic optimism , this positive valuation could derive from two factors : newcomers are often comparing U.S. schools to those in their native lands , and they have also had less opportunity to be disappointed by their experiences here .

That would be a new record for the foreign - born share , with the bureau projecting that the previous record high of 14.8 % in 1890 will be passed as soon as 2025 . Yet while Asian and Hispanic immigrants are projected to continue to be the main sources of U.S. immigrant population growth , the new projections show that the share of the foreign born is expected to fall among these two groups .

And while about a third of U.S. Hispanics ( 34.9 % ) are now foreign - born , the Census Bureau projects that this share too will fall , to 27.4 % in 2060 .
