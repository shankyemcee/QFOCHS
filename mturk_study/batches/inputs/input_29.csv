By the time the well was sealed months later , about 5 million barrels of oil had spilled into the Gulf . Here are five key facts about the oil spill and its aftermath : Support for offshore drilling plummeted after the 2010 spill , but has largely recovered since . Between February and May of 2010 , the share of Americans who favored more offshore oil and gas drilling fell from 63 % to 54 % . By June , support dropped another 10 percentage points and more people opposed increased drilling ( 52 % ) than favored it ( 44 % ) . But support rose subsequent years , though not to the same heights . Last December , 56 % said they favored the government allowing more offshore drilling and 40 % opposed the practice .

But whatever impact the latest events have on international opinion about Putin , views about him in the U.S. and allied countries had already turned negative compared with when he was first elected to office in 2000 . A Gallup poll conducted Feb. 6 - 9 found that 63 % of Americans had an unfavorable view of Putin , the highest ever in its polling . That followed a year of U.S.-Russian tensions that included sharp differences over Syria , Russia ’s decision to grant asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden and Putin ’s op - ed piece in the New York Times taking issue with President Obama ’s evocation of American exceptionalism .

The only story as closely watched in 2010 was that of another disaster , the January earthquake in Haiti ( 60 % paid close attention at the peak ) . Public interest went hand - in - hand with the vast amount of news coverage of the spill . The Gulf spill was the most covered news story in nine weeks out of a 14 - week period studied by Pew Research Center .

No more than 13 % say there is a good chance they would vote for any single other candidate . However , among the field of possible candidates beyond Clinton , there is little differentiation at this early stage . This is particularly the case when it comes to possible GOP contenders : Jeb Bush , Mike Huckabee , Rand Paul , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , Scott Walker and Ben Carson all have about one - in - ten registered voters saying there is a good chance they would vote for them . At this stage , there is considerable variance in awareness of potential candidates . Virtually all voters have heard of Clinton , and Biden and Jeb Bush also are widely known . Among the other Republicans , Mike Huckabee , Chris Christie , Rand Paul , Ted Cruz , Rick Perry , and Marco Rubio are familiar to at least two - thirds of voters . But fewer than half of all voters have heard of Bobby Jindal , Ben Carson or Scott Walker .

The adoption pattern of cell phones in emerging countries like Turkey , Lebanon and Chile do not look very different from America . China and Russia have even nudged ahead of the U.S. But other countries lag . In Pakistan , slightly more than half have a cell phone and in Mexico , it ’s just above six - in - ten . Still , the rapid rise in cell phone ownership is quite breathtaking and might be due to the fact that many nations , unlike the U.S. , have skipped landline technology and moved straight to mobile . Smartphone adoption , however , shows a different picture . More than half of Americans ( 55 % ) have a smartphone , 34 % have a feature phone , and 9 % have no phone . Elsewhere in the world , a smartphone is less common . However , significant minorities in countries such as Lebanon ( 45 % ) and China ( 37 % ) own a smartphone and the future looks bright for the technology . In every country polled , there is a significant age gap on smartphone ownership , with people under 30 more likely to own the devices . For instance , 69 % of 18- 29 year - olds in China have a smartphone , making it the predominant technological choice for future generations .",mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/2150.png,More Women Marrying Down' % ofcurrently married couples,"It used to be more common for a husband to have more education than his wife in America .

Even though college graduates are increasingly more likely to marry each other , the overall share of couples of similar education levels is down from nearly 80 % in 1960 to about 60 % in 2012 . The primary reason for the decline in the share of married couples with similar education levels is that marriages between spouses with high school or less than high school education are much less common these days — the share is down from 74 % of all marriages in 1960 to 24 % in 2012 . In addition , adults with high school or less education are much less likely to marry . The marriage rate among this group plummeted — from 72 % in 1960 to 46 % in 2012 . Just the opposite has occurred among college graduates . The share of couples in which both spouses have a college degree has risen steadily in recent decades . In 1960 , only 3 % of couples were in this group , the share rose to 22 % in 2012 .

Here are five key takeaways based on the report , which incorporates data from surveys , analysis of media content , an audit of local news providers and social media analysis . Local news matters to local residents . About nine - in - ten residents in each city said they followed news about their local area at least somewhat closely , while about eight - in - ten said the same about neighborhood news . This is true in Denver , where researchers found 143 sources of news and information , but it ’s also true in Macon , with 24 sources , and Sioux City , with 31 sources . Digital technology has impacted news habits in all three cities , but at different levels . More than half of residents in Sioux City and two - thirds in Macon and Denver access at least one news provider digitally , and roughly a quarter say they get at least some local news from social networking sites . But within those numbers , residents of Denver are most likely to say the internet is very important to keeping up with local news ( 45 % , compared with 38 % in Macon and 33 % in Sioux City ) , and news providers there make greater use of digital capabilities such as embedded links in news stories ( 31 % of news stories in Denver contained these , versus fewer than 5 % in Macon or Sioux City ) .

The share reporting same - sex sexual experiences also grew from 17 % in the control group to 27 % in the Veiled Report group , they reported . ( Because their experiment did not use a random sample of the adult population , the researchers do not attempt to estimate the actual size of the country ’s gay and lesbian population . ) The experimental method also increased the rates of anti - gay sentiment . For example , the share who disapproved of having an openly gay manager at work increased from 16 % in the control group to 27 % in the Veiled Report group . The proportion who thought it should be legal to discriminate when hiring on the basis of sexual orientation also rose from 14 % to 25 % . However , those in the Veiled Report treatment were less likely than those in the Direct Report treatment to say that a homosexual person “ can change their sexual orientation if they choose to do so ” ( 22 % vs. 15 % ) .

The pattern appeared to continue last month : Clothiers and department stores accounted for more than half of November ’s retail job gains , adding 121,600 and 114,700 jobs respectively .

Those patterns have n’t changed much over the past decade , though department stores account for less of the seasonal surge than they used to ( as well as a smaller share of retail employment generally ) and clothing / accessories stores account for more . While the pre - holiday hiring surge is impressive , the post - holiday drop is even more dramatic . Retail payrolls typically fall 5 % to 6 % between December and February , as retailers with disappointing holiday sales lay off staff and close unprofitable stores .

Last month , according to BLS , 85.9 million adults did n’t want a job now , or 93.3 % of all adults not in the labor force . ( All of the figures we ’re using in this post are unadjusted for seasonal variations . ) But let ’s look in particular at the youngest part of the eligible workforce . The share of 16- to 24 - year - olds saying they did n’t want a job rose from an average 29.5 % in 2000 to an average 39.4 % over the first 10 months of this year . There was a much smaller increase among prime working - age adults ( ages 25 to 54 ) over that period . And among people aged 55 and up , the share saying they did n’t want a job actually fell , to an average 58.2 % this year .

In October, nearly 2.2 million people who had searched for work sometime in the past year and were available for work were considered 'marginally attached' to the labor force. Here's why the said they hadn 't looked for work in the past four weeks:","Researchers disagree about why people leave the labor force and how likely they are ever to return . In a report issued in February , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that about half the decline in labor - force participation was due to long - term demographic trends , a third was due to cyclical weaknesses in the labor market , and the rest a consequence of “ unusually protracted weakness in the demand for labor [ which ] appears to have led some workers to become discouraged and permanently drop out of the labor force , ” such as by taking early retirement or signing up for Social Security disability benefits . But two Federal Reserve economists have argued that cyclical factors , rather than demographic shifts , account for the bulk of the drop in labor - force participation since 2007 . Economists are especially interested in the subset of non - participants who are considered “ marginally attached ” to the labor force . Those people are n’t counted as unemployed , because they have n’t looked for work in the past four weeks , but they have job - hunted sometime in the past year and say both that they want a job and are available to take one right away . Many labor economists believe marginally attached people are most likely to be drawn back into the labor force . But discouraged workers make up only about 35 % of all marginally attached workers , and account for just over half the increase in their ranks since the 2008 financial panic . The rest of the marginally attached cite a range of reasons for not having looked for work recently , including family responsibilities , being in school , ill health , and problems with child care or transportation .",Describe economists' discussions on 'marginally attached' issue,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1854.png,"Recent Two-Term Presidents, Before & After Their Second Midterm Elections %job approval Clinton","The midterm elections that handed losses to many Democrats across the country have n’t resulted in much change for President Obama ’s approval rating – it has barely moved in over a year and remains at 43 % .

Actually , you probably ca n’t : An overwhelming majority of voters live in congressional districts with little real competition , and a handful without any at all . A Pew Research Center report last week used ratings and analyses by such sources as the Cook Political Report and Real Clear Politics to estimate that there are only 14 truly competitive House elections this year . But the ratings are only predictions , and if history is any guide several more House races will turn out closer than expected . In 2012 , for instance , 29 House candidates won by less than 5 percentage points over their closest rival ; another 34 won by at least five but fewer than 10 percentage points . Still , that ’s only 63 races out of 435 House districts , representing around 15 % of eligible voters . We wondered how those figures compare with earlier elections , so we examined data from two separate sources . Using data from the Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , we estimated how many eligible voters there were in each congressional district from 2006 ( when the ACS series begins ) through 2012 . ( Quick refresher : Eligible voters are 18 years or older and either native - born or naturalized U.S. citizens . ) We obtained vote totals for every House race from the House Clerk ’s office . As it turns out , the number of close races — those decided by fewer than 5 percentage points — does n’t vary all that much from election cycle to election cycle : from a low of 25 in 2008 up to 38 in the Tea Party year of 2010 , when Republicans regained control of the House . Raising the victory - margin threshold to 10 percentage points roughly doubled the number of districts that could be considered competitive .

But even prior to the Islamic State ’s push there , Turks have held decidedly negative views of the U.S. going back over a decade , and , additionally , do not much like other foreign powers either . Since we began polling the Turkish people in 2002 , shortly after the 9/11 attacks , never have more than three - in - ten said they have a favorable view of the U.S. But anti - Americanism really spiked in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War , when 83 % of Turks held a negative view of America . Today , only 19 % in Turkey like the U.S. , while nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) share a dislike of their NATO ally . ( Unfortunately , we do not have comparable data for American views of Turkey ) . But Turkish distaste for foreign powers does not begin and end with the U.S. On balance , around two - thirds or more Turks express unfavorable views of the European Union , China , Brazil , Russia , Iran and Israel . Turks even dislike Saudi Arabia ( 53 % unfavorable and , notably , the highest favorability percentage ( 26 % ) among all countries we asked about ) . The people of Turkey also hold negative views toward NATO specifically ( 70 % dislike the organization ) . In fact , it is hard to find any country or organization the Turkish people really like , except , of course , Turkey itself .

If you look simply at the total percentage of online adults who say they trust a news organization for news about government and politics , several mainstream television outlets rise to the top . CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four - in - ten web - using U.S. adults . These high numbers , though , are intertwined with the fact that more than nine - in - ten respondents have heard of these five news sources . Trust and distrust were only asked of sources respondents had heard of , thus , the better known a source is , the more Americans in total who can voice trust or distrust of that source . A source like The Economist , on the other hand , is known by just 34 % of respondents and so could never have a trust level exceeding 34 % — even if everyone who had heard of it trusted it . What about the ratio of trust to distrust ? Another way to think of trust is to compare trust and distrust in a news source . In other words , what is the ratio of people who trust a news outlet to those who distrust it ? This ratio is based just on those who have rated the sources as trusted or distrusted , regardless of how well known the source is . The result is a different list of news brands : The Economist , BBC , NPR , PBS and The Wall Street Journal are among those with the highest ratio of trust to distrust – even if the overall percentages of those who trust them are smaller than for some other sources . Only 34 % of online Americans , for example , have heard of The Economist , but there is far more trust ( 12 % ) than distrust ( 2 % ) when it comes to news about government and politics ( 20 % neither trust nor distrust The Economist ) . The BBC is recognized by a greater portion of respondents ( 76 % ) , but is similarly more trusted ( 36 % ) than distrusted ( 7 % ) .",Describe the trust level about different aspects on The Economist.,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1875.png,"the people experience unusually high rates of online harassment Among all internetusers, the % who have experienced the following types of online harassment, by age","1 40 % of internet users have personally experienced online harassment .

The Chinese education system ’s intense focus on test - taking has received a fair amount of attention in recent years , especially after Shanghai students topped the rankings for math , science , and reading on the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) exam .

Meanwhile , the Asian population grew to 19.4 million , with a growth rate of 2.9 % . U.S. births have been the primary driving force behind the increase in the Hispanic population since 2000 and that trend continued between 2012 and 2013 . The Census Bureau estimates that natural increase ( births minus deaths ) accounted for 78 % of the total change in the U.S. Hispanic population from 2012 to 2013 . By comparison , growth in the Asian American population has been fueled primarily by immigration . Fully 74 % of Asian adults in 2012 were foreign born according to Pew Research Center analysis of Census data , and international migration accounted for about 61 % of the total change in the Asian American population from 2012 to 2013 .

And sizable minorities of both groups say they ’d be dismayed if someone from the “ other side ” were to marry into their family . And when given the choice , three - quarters of consistent conservatives say they ’d prefer to live in a community of larger houses with more space between them , even if that means having to drive to shops , restaurants and other amenities .

The finding was widely covered as a dramatic illustration of the agency ’s projections that the U.S. will become a majority - minority nation within three decades . But that tipping point may not have arrived yet , according to preliminary 2013 birth data released last week by the National Center for Health Statistics . The center ’s numbers indicate that non - Hispanic white mothers still account for 54 % of births — as they had in 2012 and 2011 . The Census Bureau ’s initial announcement was that members of minority groups — defined as anyone who is not non - Hispanic white — accounted for 50.4 % of the U.S. population younger than age 1 on July 1 , 2011 . The bureau ’s annual population estimates for July 1 , 2012 , placed the minority share at 50.1 % . The agency ’s annual population estimate for July 1 , 2013 , is to be released June 26 . In recent decades , non - Hispanic whites have been a shrinking share of newborns in data produced by both agencies . To some extent , the data discrepancy between them reflects differences in what each agency measures : The Census Bureau classifies the children based on the race and Hispanic origin of both parents , while the National Center for Health Statistics reports only the mother ’s race . The two agencies also use somewhat different methods to categorize race .
