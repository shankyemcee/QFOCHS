But that finding masked a partisan divide : Nearly seven - in - ten Republicans ( 69 % ) , but only 47 % of Democrats , supported using force to aid a NATO ally attacked by Russia . Last year ’s survey found that the U.S. and Canada were the only countries in which more than half of respondents backed using military force if Russia got into a serious conflict with a NATO ally . At least half of Germans , French and Italians said their countries should not use military force to defend a NATO ally if attacked by Russia .

Hispanic voters this year make up an even larger share of the state ’s registered voters than in past years , but the profile of the Latino electorate has shifted over the past decade or so , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state voter registration data . Due to the state ’s large Cuban voting bloc , the Latino vote had been reliably Republican . For example , President George W. Bush won both the Hispanic vote and the state in 2004 . But 2008 represented a tipping point : More Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans , and the gap has only widened since then . This has led to the growing influence of Democrats among the state ’s Hispanic voters in 2008 and 2012 , two presidential elections in which Barack Obama carried both Hispanics and the state . At the same time , the number of Latino registered voters in Florida who indicate no party affiliation has also grown rapidly during this time , and by 2012 had surpassed Republican registrations . Among all Floridians , registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in 2016 . This is due in part to Hispanics , who accounted for 88 % of growth in the number of registered Democrats between 2006 and 2016 . During this time , the number of Hispanic registered voters increased by 61 % , while the number of Hispanics identifying as Democrats increased by 83 % and those having no party affiliation increased by 95 % . The number of Hispanic Republican registered voters has grown too – but much more slowly ( just 16 % ) . As a result , among Hispanic registered voters in 2016 , 678,000 were registered as Democrats , 610,000 indicated no party affiliation and 479,000 were registered as Republicans .

In total , 17 % of them did not learn from any type of source , nearly double that of the next highest age group ( though the vast majority of younger adults – 83 % – did learn about the election ) . This corresponds to earlier research showing that younger adults tend to be more politically unengaged . Those with more ideologically consistent views are more likely to have learned about the election than those who had ideologically mixed views . Of those with mixed views , 14 % did n’t learn about the election from any source , which is higher than those who are more consistently liberal or conservative .

Of the 41 states scheduled to hold at least one major - party primary ( up from 40 in 2008 ) , 35 will hold both Republican and Democratic primaries , though not necessarily on the same day . The current system , such as it is , has evolved over more than four decades . Up to the early 1970s , ordinary voters had relatively little input into the parties ’ presidential nominations : The nominees were chosen at the big national conventions , and most convention delegates were chosen by caucuses , local conventions , state committees or other forums dominated by party insiders and political professionals . Candidates entered primaries largely to demonstrate their voter appeal , rather than win delegates : In 1968 , for example , only 15 states held primaries , which together sent about 40 % of the delegates to each party ’s convention .",Comment on the numbers for the state and territorial primaries in 2016.,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1335.png,Generation gap in confidence in nation's future is not new % saying they have 'quite a lot of confidence in the future of the United States 2015,"In a survey of attitudes about government conducted last fall , just 37 % of Millennials said they had “ quite a lot of confidence ” in the future of the United States , compared with 45 % of Gen Xers , 49 % of Boomers and 56 % of the Silent Generation .

Hawalian/Pacific islanders and multi race Americans,"An analysis of changes in the nation ’s eligible voting population – U.S. citizens ages 18 and older – offers a preview of profound U.S. demographic shifts that are projected to continue for decades to come . While the nation ’s 156 million non - Hispanic white eligible voters in 2016 far outnumber the 70 million eligible voters that are racial or ethnic minorities , their growth lags that of minority groups . As a result , the non - Hispanic white share of the electorate has fallen from 71 % in 2012 to 69 % . There are 10.7 million more eligible voters today than there were in 2012 . More than two - thirds of net growth in the U.S. electorate during this time has come from racial and ethnic minorities . Hispanics , blacks , Asians and other minorities had a net increase of 7.5 million eligible voters , compared with a net increase of 3.2 million among non - Hispanic white eligible voters . The growth among non - Hispanic white eligible voters has been slower than among racial or ethnic minorities in large part because they are overrepresented in deaths due to an aging population . Non - Hispanic whites make up 69 % of U.S. eligible voters , but accounted for 76 % of all eligible voters who died ( 6.6 million of 8.7 million ) between 2012 and 2016 . Another reason growth has lagged among non - Hispanic white eligible voters is that they ’re underrepresented among young people born in the U.S. who turn 18 – the group most responsible for the nation ’s growth in eligible voters . Non - Hispanic whites accounted for 57 % of the 16 million new eligible voters who turned 18 between 2012 and 2016 .

Today , reducing the budget deficit ranks ninth in priority out of 18 policy areas tested in the survey . The latest national survey by Pew Research Center , conducted Jan. 7 - 14 among 2,009 adults , finds that strengthening the nation ’s economy and defending the country from future terrorist attacks rank atop the public ’s priority list : 75 % each say these should be top priorities for the country .

Although the combined sample sizes in these pre - election polls do not allow for examination by individual year of birth , cohorts that comprise a few years – based on the president when each cohort turned 18 – are revealing . In the last presidential election , for instance , Boomers who came of age during the Nixon administration ( born between 1951 and 1956 ) favored Barack Obama over Mitt Romney to a greater degree than people who were slightly older or younger . Those who came of age during the Clinton administration ( those born 1975 to 1982 , mostly younger Xers ) were significantly more likely to favor Obama than the national average , while those who turned 18 during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ( primarily older Xers and younger Boomers ) were more Republican in their preferences . As of the 2012 election , both older and younger Millennials favored Obama by wide margins . Those who came of age during Bush ’s presidency ( those born 1983 to 1990 , older Millennials ) favored Obama over Romney by 19 percentage points more than the national average . Those who came of age during Obama ’s first term ( born 1991 to 1994 , mostly younger Millennials ) voted for Obama by an even wider margin .

Here are five key takeaways based on the report , which incorporates data from surveys , analysis of media content , an audit of local news providers and social media analysis . Local news matters to local residents . About nine - in - ten residents in each city said they followed news about their local area at least somewhat closely , while about eight - in - ten said the same about neighborhood news . This is true in Denver , where researchers found 143 sources of news and information , but it ’s also true in Macon , with 24 sources , and Sioux City , with 31 sources . Digital technology has impacted news habits in all three cities , but at different levels . More than half of residents in Sioux City and two - thirds in Macon and Denver access at least one news provider digitally , and roughly a quarter say they get at least some local news from social networking sites . But within those numbers , residents of Denver are most likely to say the internet is very important to keeping up with local news ( 45 % , compared with 38 % in Macon and 33 % in Sioux City ) , and news providers there make greater use of digital capabilities such as embedded links in news stories ( 31 % of news stories in Denver contained these , versus fewer than 5 % in Macon or Sioux City ) .

While it ’s hard to say whose account is the most accurate when it comes to how parenting and household responsibilities are shared , an analysis of the American Time Use Survey ( ATUS ) data provides a glimpse into how full - time working moms and dads spend their time . This analysis shows that while full - time working moms spend more time than full - time working dads on parenting and household tasks , the difference is modest .

In most cases , these unmarried parents are single . However , a small share of all children—4%—are living with two cohabiting parents , according to CPS data .

At the time , relatively few anticipated the size or demographic impact of the post-1965 immigration flow ( Gjelten , 2015 ) . In absolute numbers , the roughly 59 million immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between 1965 and 2015 exceed those who arrived in the great waves of European - dominated immigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Between 1840 and 1889 , 14.3 million immigrants came to the U.S. , and between 1890 and 1919 , an additional 18.2 million arrived ( see Table 1 for details ) . As a result of its changed makeup and rapid growth , new immigration since 1965 has altered the nation ’s racial and ethnic composition . In 1965 , 84 % of Americans were non - Hispanic whites . By 2015 , that share had declined to 62 % . Meanwhile , the Hispanic share of the U.S. population rose from 4 % in 1965 to 18 % in 2015 .

But as immigration from Latin America slows , the immigrant share among each of the nation ’s Hispanic origin groups is in decline , according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data . This report explores data of the 14 largest Hispanic origin groups , unless otherwise noted . The foreign - born share of Salvadorans , for example , fell from 76 % in 2000 to 59 % in 2013 — the largest percentage point decline of any of the six largest Hispanic origin groups . Similarly , Dominicans , Guatemalans , and Colombians all had decreases of over 13 percentage points in their foreign - born shares over the same period . Mexicans , the nation ’s largest Hispanic origin group , also saw a decline , though it was only 8 percentage points since 2000 . A decline is underway among smaller Hispanic origin groups , too ( see Appendix Table A1 ) . Overall , the share of the Hispanic population that is foreign born has decreased from 40 % in 2000 to 35 % in 2013 . Despite falling immigrant shares across all Latino origin groups , fast Latino population growth has led to continued growth in the number of Latino immigrants ( though growth has slowed in recent years ) . Among all Latinos , there were 14.1 million immigrants in 2000 . By 2005 , that number reached 16.8 million , and by 2013 , there were 19 million Latino immigrants in the U.S. The same pattern is present among all Latino origin groups , though for three — Ecuadorians , Mexicans and Nicaraguans — the number of immigrants has declined since 2010 ( for details , see Appendix Table A2 ) .",Describe details about Immigrant Share Falls Among Largest Hispanic Origin Groups since 2000?,mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1488.png,FIGURE2 Puerto Rican Views of Identity % saying they most often describe themselues as...

In October, nearly 2.2 million people who had searched for work sometime in the past year and were available for work were considered ""marginally attached"" to the labor force. Here's why the said they hadn 't looked for work in the past four weeks:","Researchers disagree about why people leave the labor force and how likely they are ever to return . In a report issued in February , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that about half the decline in labor - force participation was due to long - term demographic trends , a third was due to cyclical weaknesses in the labor market , and the rest a consequence of “ unusually protracted weakness in the demand for labor [ which ] appears to have led some workers to become discouraged and permanently drop out of the labor force , ” such as by taking early retirement or signing up for Social Security disability benefits . But two Federal Reserve economists have argued that cyclical factors , rather than demographic shifts , account for the bulk of the drop in labor - force participation since 2007 . Economists are especially interested in the subset of non - participants who are considered “ marginally attached ” to the labor force . Those people are n’t counted as unemployed , because they have n’t looked for work in the past four weeks , but they have job - hunted sometime in the past year and say both that they want a job and are available to take one right away . Many labor economists believe marginally attached people are most likely to be drawn back into the labor force . But discouraged workers make up only about 35 % of all marginally attached workers , and account for just over half the increase in their ranks since the 2008 financial panic . The rest of the marginally attached cite a range of reasons for not having looked for work recently , including family responsibilities , being in school , ill health , and problems with child care or transportation .",mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1854.png,"Recent Two-Term Presidents, Before & After Their Second Midterm Elections %job approval Clinton","The midterm elections that handed losses to many Democrats across the country have n’t resulted in much change for President Obama ’s approval rating – it has barely moved in over a year and remains at 43 % .

Actually , you probably ca n’t : An overwhelming majority of voters live in congressional districts with little real competition , and a handful without any at all . A Pew Research Center report last week used ratings and analyses by such sources as the Cook Political Report and Real Clear Politics to estimate that there are only 14 truly competitive House elections this year . But the ratings are only predictions , and if history is any guide several more House races will turn out closer than expected . In 2012 , for instance , 29 House candidates won by less than 5 percentage points over their closest rival ; another 34 won by at least five but fewer than 10 percentage points . Still , that ’s only 63 races out of 435 House districts , representing around 15 % of eligible voters . We wondered how those figures compare with earlier elections , so we examined data from two separate sources . Using data from the Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , we estimated how many eligible voters there were in each congressional district from 2006 ( when the ACS series begins ) through 2012 . ( Quick refresher : Eligible voters are 18 years or older and either native - born or naturalized U.S. citizens . ) We obtained vote totals for every House race from the House Clerk ’s office . As it turns out , the number of close races — those decided by fewer than 5 percentage points — does n’t vary all that much from election cycle to election cycle : from a low of 25 in 2008 up to 38 in the Tea Party year of 2010 , when Republicans regained control of the House . Raising the victory - margin threshold to 10 percentage points roughly doubled the number of districts that could be considered competitive . Even so , at least eight of every 10 eligible voters resided in districts without competitive races .",mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1866.png,"More voters are using their cell phones to keep up with election news, large increase among 30-49 year olds % ofregistered voters politics who use their cell phone to keep up with news related to the election or politics","As smartphone ownership has increased dramatically in recent years , more and more Americans are using their mobile devices to keep tabs on political events .

CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four - in - ten web - using U.S. adults . These high numbers , though , are intertwined with the fact that more than nine - in - ten respondents have heard of these five news sources . Trust and distrust were only asked of sources respondents had heard of , thus , the better known a source is , the more Americans in total who can voice trust or distrust of that source . A source like The Economist , on the other hand , is known by just 34 % of respondents and so could never have a trust level exceeding 34 % — even if everyone who had heard of it trusted it . What about the ratio of trust to distrust ? Another way to think of trust is to compare trust and distrust in a news source . In other words , what is the ratio of people who trust a news outlet to those who distrust it ? This ratio is based just on those who have rated the sources as trusted or distrusted , regardless of how well known the source is . The result is a different list of news brands : The Economist , BBC , NPR , PBS and The Wall Street Journal are among those with the highest ratio of trust to distrust – even if the overall percentages of those who trust them are smaller than for some other sources . Only 34 % of online Americans , for example , have heard of The Economist , but there is far more trust ( 12 % ) than distrust ( 2 % ) when it comes to news about government and politics ( 20 % neither trust nor distrust The Economist ) .

The finding was widely covered as a dramatic illustration of the agency ’s projections that the U.S. will become a majority - minority nation within three decades . But that tipping point may not have arrived yet , according to preliminary 2013 birth data released last week by the National Center for Health Statistics . The center ’s numbers indicate that non - Hispanic white mothers still account for 54 % of births — as they had in 2012 and 2011 . The Census Bureau ’s initial announcement was that members of minority groups — defined as anyone who is not non - Hispanic white — accounted for 50.4 % of the U.S. population younger than age 1 on July 1 , 2011 . The bureau ’s annual population estimates for July 1 , 2012 , placed the minority share at 50.1 % . The agency ’s annual population estimate for July 1 , 2013 , is to be released June 26 . In recent decades , non - Hispanic whites have been a shrinking share of newborns in data produced by both agencies . To some extent , the data discrepancy between them reflects differences in what each agency measures : The Census Bureau classifies the children based on the race and Hispanic origin of both parents , while the National Center for Health Statistics reports only the mother ’s race . The two agencies also use somewhat different methods to categorize race .
