The overall number of federal judges Trump has appointed to date ( 194 ) is similar to the number appointed by George W. Bush at the same juncture in his presidency ( 197 ) . Trump , however , stands out for his unusually large number of appeals court judges — the powerful regional jurists who have the final word on most appeals that do not end up in the Supreme Court and who frequently end up becoming Supreme Court justices themselves . Eight of the nine current high court justices , including both of Trump ’s appointees , previously served as appeals court judges . Trump has appointed 53 appeals court judges to date , far higher than the number appointed by nearly every other recent president at the same point in their tenure .
