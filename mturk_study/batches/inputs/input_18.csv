For example , 85 % of the Silent generation identify as a member of a Christian denomination , while just 11 % say they are religiously unaffiliated ( defined as atheist , agnostic or “ nothing in particular ” ) . By contrast , smaller majorities of Millennials ( 56 % ) and Gen Xers ( 70 % ) identify as Christian , while as many as 35 % of Millennials and 23 % of Gen Xers do not identify with any organized religion . Over the past seven years , the share of the U.S. population that does not identify with an organized religion has grown since 2007 . Much of this change has occurred due to generational replacement ; the youngest adults who are aging into the population are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated than the oldest adults they are replacing .",Describe generational affiliations with religion.,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10119.png,Wide Ideological Divide by Generation % with political values that are..

When conducting a new poll , survey researchers often go to a lot of trouble to find out how many of the people they targeted to take the survey actually end up completing the questionnaire , a concept referred to as the response rate . In this case , we found that those who were asked to take the survey on a Web browser were more likely to complete at least one survey than those using apps to take the survey , resulting in overall response rates of 84 % and 58 % , respectively . Part of this may be due to the fact that many panelists assigned to use the app had trouble using it because they did n’t know what an app was , how to download it or how to use it even though they own a smartphone . In the future , we will take this into consideration because if fewer people use the survey app , this has implications for both the precision of the data collected and for cost . 3 ) App and Web respondents look similar demographically , and their answers basically did not differ . App respondents were somewhat younger , more likely to be from the Midwest and less likely to be registered to vote than Web respondents .

On the one hand , this group , which makes up half of the adult U.S. Hispanic population , is less likely than other Americans to have ever visited a U.S. public library and is much less likely to say that they see it as “ very easy ” to do so . At the same time , Hispanic immigrants who have made their way to a public library stand out as the most appreciative of what libraries have to offer , from free books to research resources to the fact that libraries tend to offer a quiet , safe space . And they are more likely than other groups to say that closing their community library would have a major impact on their family . These are some of the findings of this latest installment of the Pew Research Center ’s reporting on the Center ’s landmark 2013 Library Services Survey . Seven - in - ten 		 ( 72 % ) Latinos ages 16 and older say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person at one point or another in their lives ,  		  the survey shows , a share below that of whites ( 83 % ) and blacks ( 80 % ) . But this finding masks a large difference among Latinos . Fully 		 83 % of U.S.-born Latinos say they have visited a public library at some point in their lives — a share similar to that of whites and blacks . However , among immigrant Latinos , a smaller share—60%—say they have visited a public library or bookmobile in person . Some public library services can also be accessed remotely through library websites . Here , too , though , the survey finds a gap in use between U.S.-born Latinos ( 49 % ) , blacks ( 48 % ) and whites ( 45 % ) who say they have accessed a public library website and immigrant Latinos ( 27 % ) who say the same .",Which Hispanic group most appreciates what public libraries have to offer?,mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10985.png,Foreign-Born Latinos Less Likely to Say It Would Be Very Easy to Use a Library,"This gap in use between foreign - born Hispanics and U.S.-born Hispanics , whites and blacks may reflect foreign - born Hispanics ’ views of the relative ease of using public libraries .
