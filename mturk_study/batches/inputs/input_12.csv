In the context of these ongoing arguments over the role and nature of bots , Pew Research Center set out to better understand how many of the links being shared on Twitter – most of which refer to a site outside the platform itself – are being promoted by bots rather than humans . To do this , the Center used a list of 2,315 of the most popular websites1 and examined the roughly 1.2 million tweets ( sent by English language users ) that included links to those sites during a roughly six - week period in summer 2017 . The results illustrate the pervasive role that automated accounts play in disseminating links to a wide range of prominent websites on Twitter . These findings are based on an analysis of a random sample of about 1.2 million tweets from English language users containing links to popular websites over the time period of July 27 to Sept. 11 , 2017.4 To construct the list of popular sites used in this analysis , the Center identified nearly 3,000 of the most - shared websites during the first 18 days of the study period and coded them based on a variety of characteristics.5 After removing links that were dead , duplicated or directed to sites without sufficient information to classify their content , researchers arrived at a list of 2,315 websites ."
