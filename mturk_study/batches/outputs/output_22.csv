Political scientists ( and practical politicians ) long have recognized that voter turnout surges in presidential election years and falls off in midterm elections . In the 2008 presidential election , for example , nearly 59 % of estimated eligible voters voted in that year ’s House elections . Two years later for the midterms , only about 41 % of eligible voters went to the polls . ( We estimated eligible voters in each district from 2006 through 2012 using data from the Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , and obtained vote totals for every House race from the House Clerk ’s office . Our analysis excluded a handful of races in which unopposed candidates were n’t listed on the ballot . ) You might think there ’d be some relationship between how competitive a given election is and turnout . A race where victory could go either way might spur more interest and rev up get - out - the - vote efforts from both sides ; a race where one candidate is a prohibitive favorite could lead many people to conclude there ’s no point in heading out to vote . But our analysis shows little , if any , correlation between a House election ’s competitiveness ( measured by the winner ’s victory margin ) and turnout . In the Tea Party year of 2010 , for example , overall turnout in House races was 40.7 % of estimated eligible voters . That year , the nation ’s highest turnout was in Wisconsin ’s 5th District , where 62.4 % of estimated eligible voters cast ballots and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner cruised to a 42 - percentage - point victory . The nation ’s tightest race in 2010 was in Illinois ’ 8th District , where Republican Joe Walsh edged Democrat Melissa Bean by just 290 votes ; 41.7 % of estimated eligible voters cast ballots in that contest . ( The lowest turnout rate in 2010 , 19.5 % , came in Texas ’ 16th District , which Democrat Silvestre Reyes won by a comfortable 21.5 percentage points . )","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/336.png","Local TV stations profit from political advertising dollars during the midterm election season.","The upcoming midterm elections might be underwhelming for many Americans , but it could shape up to be one of the most profitable for local TV stations – one of the sources Americans turn to most for news about politics . Local TV has been receiving the largest portion of political media spending for at least a decade , but the share it consumes and the total dollars reaped continue to grow . Through mid - October , local TV stations have captured 95 % of the television political ad spending , which includes spot , national cable , national network broadcast ( local cable political ad spending is not part of this analysis ) . In 2012 , during the last presidential elections , local TV stations captured 92 % of total political TV ad spending , based on the same analysis . From January to mid - October 2014 , total political ad spending for local TV was about $ 1.3 billion , according to a Television Bureau of Advertising ( TVB ) analysis of Kantar CMAG data . Those dollars , though , are far from evenly distributed across the states . More than half of that has gone to 10 states with the most competitive races ( Florida , California , Texas , Colorado , Illinois , Michigan , Georgia , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and New York ) . In Florida , a state with a closely - watched governor ’s race pitting incumbent Rick Scott against former Republican - now Democrat Charlie Crist , the political ad spending has topped $ 100 million dollars , the highest among all states .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/338.png","How Americans, Europeans See the Economic Future","We looked at two measures of consumer confidence : the University of Michigan ’s Index of Consumer Expectations ( part of its broader monthly surveys of consumer sentiment ) and the European Consumer Confidence Indicator , produced by Eurostat , the EU ’s statistical research office .

The UMich index is derived from three questions on personal financial expectations a year from now and expectations for the U.S. economy one and five years out , relative to a 1966 base year . The EU metric is the average of the answers to four questions covering expectations for household finances , general economic conditions , unemployment and personal savings over the next 12 months . Despite some ups and downs , the U.S. expectations index generally has been trending modestly upward since the beginning of 2012 ; October ’s preliminary reading of 78.4 , in fact , was the second - highest since the official end of the Great Recession . ( Not that Americans are ready to throw the economy a parade : In August , a Pew Research Center survey found that 54 % of the public expected national economic conditions to be about the same a year from now , while 22 % expected conditions to be better and the same percentage expected them to be worse . )","Despite Bush ’s intensive campaign to promote the idea , the percentage of Americans who say they favor private accounts has tumbled to 46 % in Pew ’s latest nationwide survey , down from 54 % in December and 58 % in September .

The relatively high number of Millennial households in poverty partly reflects the fact that the poverty rate among households headed by a young adult has been rising over the past half century while dramatically declining among households headed by those 65 and older .

In July 2009 , just past the trough of the Great Recession , employers reported fewer than 2.2 million job openings , the lowest total since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting JOLTS data in 2000 . Another way of looking at the vacancies data is the job openings rate , which is calculated by dividing the total number of openings by the sum of total employment and openings . ( The higher the rate , the greater the nation ’s unmet demand for labor . ) The openings rate was a robust 4 % in April , matching the high points reached in July 2015 and July 2016 . Like the total number of job openings , the openings rate bottomed out in July 2009 , at 1.7 % . The JOLTS program does n’t produce state - level data , but it does indicate that the South had the most job openings in April of any region – nearly 2.2 million – though the openings rate there ( 3.9 % ) was slightly below that of the nation as a whole .

Our analysis , which used 2014 data from the UNHCR and international population estimates from the Census Bureau , found that the 1.15 million refugees in Lebanon last year – nearly all of them fleeing the civil war in neighboring Syria – represent nearly 20 % of that country ’s population of 5.9 million . In second place was Jordan , where refugees – also nearly all from Syria – represent more than 8 % of the population . Other nations adjoining conflict zones with significant refugee populations relative to their populations are Chad ( 4 % ) , which borders Sudan ; Djibouti , next to Somalia ( 2.5 % ) ; and Mauritania ( 2.2 % ) , which is sandwiched between two conflict areas , northern Mali and Western Sahara .","Describe the amount of refugees in Lebanon in 2014.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/256.png","Foreign- Born Share of Congress Little Changed Since Bottoming Out in 1960s Foreign- born members share of the House and Senate, by Congress","Just 1 % ( six members ) of the current 114th Congress immigrated into the U.S. at some point in their lives , compared with about 10 % ( nine of 95 ) who were born abroad in the first Congress of 1789 - 91 , which was a much smaller Congress , and 8 % ( 31 of 407 ) during the next peak , the 50th Congress of 1887 - 89 , amid the broader U.S. immigration wave from Europe .","Compare the number of Congress members that immigrated trough the years.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/257.png","Dramatic Rise in Internet Use, But One-in-Ten Still Offline % of U.S. adults who use the internet from any location","Drawn both by lower data collection costs and substantial advantages in how questionnaires can be designed and administered , survey research is rapidly moving to the Web .

One key factor that has made this shift possible is the fact that the vast majority of Americans now use the internet . Pew Research Center telephone surveys have documented the rise in internet adoption , which has grown from 14 % of the U.S. adult population in 1996 to 89 % today . But 89 % is not 100 % , and surveys that include only those who use the internet ( and are willing to take surveys online ) run the risk of producing biased results . How large is that risk ? This analysis documents how a wide range of common survey findings would differ if those who are unable or unwilling to take surveys online are excluded . It relies upon a series of surveys conducted over the past 15 months by Pew Research Center with its nationally representative American Trends Panel . Most members of the panel participate via the Web , while those who are unable or unwilling to take surveys online are typically interviewed by mail . By comparing the results for the full sample with those produced by the Web sample , it is possible to assess the consequences of excluding the non - internet population from surveys .","Why is survey research moving to the Web?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/605.png","China Seen as Leading Economic Power; U.S. as Military Power","While Americans believe China has assumed the leading position in the global economy , they see the military balance of power quite differently .

These trends are analyzed with regard to the national origins of the unauthorized immigrants , focusing on those from Mexico . Then I turn to a discussion of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. labor force and changing patterns over time . Finally , I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants are represented with a discussion of differences across the states . This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last November ( Passel and Cohn , 2014 ) and a new report we are releasing today ( Passel and Cohn , 2015 ) . The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990 . After 2007 , the trend changed abruptly and the numbers dropped dramatically by about 1 million over the next two years to 11.3 million in 2009 as the number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving plummeted and large numbers left the country . Since 2009 , the national unauthorized immigrant population has remained essentially unchanged as arrivals and departures have come into rough balance . ( See Figure 1 . ) From 1990 to 2007 , the number of unauthorized immigrants increased in every state , but growth was slower in the six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations than in the rest of the nation as a whole . California , the state with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in all years , experienced the largest numerical growth , but its 88 % increase from 1990 to 2007 was slower than that of other large states and nearly all smaller states . As a group , the other five largest states ( Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , New York and Texas ) experienced growth in their unauthorized immigrant population at the national average of 250 % over the period . Meanwhile , the unauthorized immigrant population in the rest of the country increased almost sevenfold , from 700,000 in 1990 to 4.7 million in 2007 .","When was unauthorized immigrant population peak in the U.S. going by statistics since 1990?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/641.png","Global Warming Is a Yery Serious Problem Argentina","Concern about climate change is much less pervasive in the United States , China and Russia than among other leading nations .
