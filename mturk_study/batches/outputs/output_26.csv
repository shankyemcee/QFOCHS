This represents a modest but statistically significant increase from the 70 % of Facebook users who indicated that they visited the site daily in 2015 . Other than this slight uptick among Facebook users , daily engagement for each of the other major social media platforms is generally similar to Pew Research Center findings from 2015 .

U.S. Muslims also appear to be more socially integrated with non - Muslims than they were a decade ago .

Yet in terms of naturalization rate , Mexicans – the single largest group of lawful immigrants by country of origin – lag well behind green - card holders eligible to apply from other parts of the globe . Based on Pew Research Center estimates using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available , two - thirds ( 67 % ) of lawful immigrants eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015 . This is the highest share since at least the mid-1990s . But among Mexican lawful immigrants eligible to apply , only 42 % had applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship by 2015 , a rate little changed since 2005 and one of the lowest among all immigrant groups when it comes to country of origin . As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green - card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2 - percentage - point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non - Mexican immigrants .","Tell some information about Naturalization rate of Mexicans vs. other immigrant groups?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/797.png","Confidence in the U.S. president plunges in several Western European countries Confidence in the U.S. president to do the rright thing regarding world affairs","In Western European countries , confidence in the U.S. president has declined sharply .

Based on Pew Research Center estimates using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available , two - thirds ( 67 % ) of lawful immigrants eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship had applied for and obtained citizenship by 2015 . This is the highest share since at least the mid-1990s . But among Mexican lawful immigrants eligible to apply , only 42 % had applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship by 2015 , a rate little changed since 2005 and one of the lowest among all immigrant groups when it comes to country of origin . As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green - card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2 - percentage - point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non - Mexican immigrants","In Western European countries , confidence in the U.S. president has declined sharply . Clear majorities in the United Kingdom , France and Germany had at least some confidence in Obama , with shares reaching 93 % in Germany at the start of his presidency . ( German confidence declined somewhat in 2014 after allegations the U.S. National Security Agency eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel , though it rebounded when the German investigation was later dropped . ) Current Trump confidence ratings in these countries are similar to their respective lows during the George W. Bush years . For example , only 13 % of French respondents had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008 , and now 14 % in France say the same for Trump . Likewise , 14 % of Germans had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008 , while 11 % are confident in Trump now . In Europe , Poland is a bit of an outlier , since its confidence in the U.S. president changed less dramatically across the three administrations . Polish respondents had a Bush - era high of 47 % confidence and an Obama - era high of 64 % , yet just 23 % of Poles have confidence in Trump in 2017 .","For Trump supporters , the candidate ’s character and personality is mentioned far more frequently than any other concern . Four - in - ten registered voters who support Trump point to his personality as their main concern – with 34 % specifically referring to his temperament or speaking style","Over the course of Obama ’s more than seven and a half years in office , overall public satisfaction with the state of the nation has never been higher than 34 %","The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population – 11.1 million in 2014 – has stabilized since the end of the Great Recession , as the number from Mexico declined but the total from other regions of the world increased , according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on government data","Beyond supremacist political views, were there any of Trump's characteristics seen favorable among his supporters?","How satisfied was the nation during Obama's presidency?","Did the Great Recession affect the number of unauthorized immigrant population?"

In 2003 , President George W. Bush received very high ratings , but those declined a bit over the course of his presidency . Obama ’s confidence ratings varied from 49 % to 71 % in the Center ’s polling in Israel during his administration . Between 2014 and 2015 , his ratings dipped substantially , reflecting tensions between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal .

And the current gap is particularly pronounced among white voters . Among white voters in the current election , college graduates support Clinton over Trump by a 14 - point margin ( 47 % Clinton vs. 33 % Trump ) , while those without college degrees back Trump over Clinton by an even larger 25 - point margin ( 51 % Trump vs. 26 % Clinton ) , according to the Center ’s survey conducted Aug. 9 - 16","Write some details about few Europeans say growing diversity makes their country a better place to live?","Tell some opinions about overwhelming majorities in Europe unhappy with EU's handling of Refugee?","Describe some information about widening educational divide in presidential preferences?"

The newspaper industry as a whole , however , faced ongoing challenges in 2016 , according to new Pew Research Center analysis . But these gains did not translate into circulation growth for the industry overall . A Pew Research Center analysis of data from AAM shows that total weekday circulation for U.S. daily newspapers – both print and digital – fell 8 % in 2016 , marking the 28th consecutive year of declines . ( Sunday circulation also fell 8 % . ) The overall decline includes a 10 % decrease in weekday print circulation ( 9 % for Sundays ) and a 1 % decline in weekday digital circulation ( 1 % rise for Sundays ) . Total weekday circulation for U.S. daily newspapers fell to 35 million , while total Sunday circulation declined to 38 million – the lowest levels since 1945 . ( For more information on how these totals were calculated , see our fact sheet . )","How's about circulation of U.S daily newspapers?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/836.png","Newspapers' circulation revenue climbs steadily even as advertising declines Total revenue for U.S. newspapers in U.S. dollars $ 60 billion","This overall decline in circulation coincided with a double - digit decline in advertising revenue for the industry as a whole . A separate Pew Research Center analysis based on the year - end financial statements of seven publicly traded U.S. newspaper companies suggests that advertising revenue across the industry declined even more sharply than in recent years : a 10 % decline , which outpaces the 8 % decline in 2015 . ( More details about this analysis are also available in the newspaper industry fact sheet . ) This decline put total ad revenue for the industry in 2016 at $ 18 billion . This is nearly a third of what it was just 10 years ago : In 2006 , the Newspaper Association of America , now known as the News Media Alliance , put total industry ad revenue at $ 49 billion . By contrast , circulation revenue has been steady over the past few years , rising from $ 10.4 billion in 2012 to $ 10.9 billion in both 2015 and 2016 . This is a small bright spot for the industry , and comes as some publishers are pursuing a “ subscription - first model ” by focusing on growing the number of subscribers rather than retaining advertising revenue . Still , gains in circulation revenue have not been nearly enough to make up for losses in advertising revenue – a pattern that holds true even at the large newspapers and major chains . According to year - end financial statements , The New York Times saw a year - over - year decline of 9 % in advertising revenue but a 3 % rise in circulation revenue , for an overall revenue decline of 2 % . Tronc , which has emphasized digital innovation in changing its name from Tribune Publishing , saw an 8 % decline in advertising revenue and a 4 % decline in total revenue , though circulation revenue increased 5 % . ( Tronc owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , among other papers . ) And Gannett saw no change in its advertising revenue , but this was due mainly to the company ’s acquisition of additional newspapers over the course of the year ; once these new acquisitions are taken out of the equation , ad revenue declined by 13 % . ( The Washington Post , as a private company , does not publish its financial results , but the company ’s chief revenue officer said in a recent New York Times article that 2017 would be “ our third straight year of double - digit revenue growth . ” )","How's about newspapers circulation declining?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/837.png","Partisan affiliation of U.S. veterans % who identify asm.

Eight years earlier , veterans backed John McCain over Barack Obama by 54 % to 44 % . ( The national exit poll did n’t ask about veteran status in 2012 . ) In the April survey , veterans were more likely than the public overall to identify as independents , but they were about as likely as adults overall to identify as Republicans . Just 20 % of veterans identified as Democrats , compared with about a third of all adults . When the partisan leanings of independents are taken into account , a majority of veterans ( 56 % ) either identified as Republicans or leaned toward the GOP ; just 40 % identified as Democrats or leaned Democratic . Among the public , these numbers were almost the reverse : 43 % identified as Republicans or leaned Republican , while 54 % identified or leaned Democratic .","How's the partisan affiliation among U.S veterans?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1184.png","Two-thirds of black social media users say that most or some of the posts they see on social media are about race % of social media users who say that of the posts they see on social networking sites are about race or race relations","In recent years , these platforms have provided new arenas for national conversations about race and racial inequality . Some researchers and activists credit social media – in particular , Black Twitter – with propelling racially focused issues to greater national attention . In fact , two of the most used hashtags around social causes in Twitter history focus on race and criminal justice : hashtag_Ferguson and hashtag_BlackLivesMatter . In addition to social and political issues , social media also serve as places where conversations about race intersect with a number of issues , including pop culture , sports and everyday personal experiences . A new Pew Research Center survey finds significant differences in the way black and white adults use social media to share and interact with race - related content1 And a Pew Research Center analysis of tweets reveals that key news events – from Baltimore , to Charleston , South Carolina , to Dallas – often serve as a catalyst for social media conversations about race . Black social media users ( 68 % ) are roughly twice as likely as whites ( 35 % ) to say that at least some of the posts they see on social networking sites are about race or race relations . When it comes to their own postings , a similar racial gap exists . Among black social media users , 28 % say most or some of what they post is about race or race relations ; 8 % of whites say the same . On the other hand , roughly two - thirds ( 67 % ) of whites who use social media say that none of things they post or share pertain to race .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1185.png","Some European publics view economy on the rebound, but others remain negative The currenteconomic situation in our country is good","In only six of the 16 countries surveyed do a majority of people feel their national economy is in good shape .

Not only are highly religious Americans less open to healthy people using these potential technologies , but they are more likely to cite a moral opposition to them – and even to connect them directly to religious themes .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1197.png","Long-standing presidential voting gender gap in presidential voting % who voted for the Democratic candidate","Hillary Clinton is now officially the first woman to top the ticket of a major U.S. political party . Her candidacy and controversial comments about women made by Donald Trump have raised the question of whether a long - standing gender gap in American politics could grow wider in 2016 . In the 1972 and 1976 elections , there was no difference in candidate support between men and women . Over the last nine presidential elections , however , women have consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates at higher rates than men . Most recently , in 2012 , there was a 10 - percentage - point gender gap : 55 % of women voted for Democrat Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney , compared with 45 % of men . The gap in 2012 was little different than it had been in Ronald Reagan ’s victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980 , when 45 % of women and just 36 % of men voted for Carter . The size of the gender gap has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range over the past 36 years ; on average , women have been 8 percentage points more likely than men to back the Democratic candidate in elections since 1980 .","Only about half ( 53 % ) of those under 30 who initially identified as Republicans or leaned Republican consistently remained with the party over four subsequent surveys . To be sure , 21 % of young Republicans left the GOP at some point after December 2015 , but returned by March . But nearly a quarter aligned with the Democrats in March : Among those under 30 who initially identified as Republicans or leaned Republican in December 2015 , 23 % shifted to the Democratic Party ( they identified or leaned Democratic ) .","Just 8 % of those who initially identified as Republicans aligned with the Democrats in March ( 4 % identified as Democrats , 4 % leaned Democratic ) . Similarly , 7 % of those who identified as Democrats defected to the GOP ( 4 % identified as Republicans , 3 % leaned Republican ) . For instance , 16 % of those who initially leaned Republican eventually called themselves Democrats ( either identified or leaned Democratic ) ; a comparable share of those who initially leaned Democratic became Republicans or Republican leaners ( 14 % ) .","Political donations from individuals represent a large share of campaign funding : In the 2016 election cycle , 71 % of Hillary Clinton ’s fundraising total and 40 % of Donald Trump ’s came from individual contributions , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . The share of Americans who say they have donated to an individual running for public office within the past year has doubled , increasing from 6 % in 1992 to 12 % in 2016 .

Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau ’s report , the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters . The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election , falling to 59.6 % in 2016 after reaching a record - high 66.6 % in 2012 . The 7 - percentage - point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks . ( It ’s also the largest percentage - point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2 % in 1992 to 60.7 % in 1996 . ) The number of black voters also declined , falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016 , representing a sharp reversal from 2012 . With Barack Obama on the ballot that year , the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time . Among whites , the 65.3 % turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1 % in 2012 . The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6 % in 2016 , compared with 48.0 % in 2012 . Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long - awaited , historic surge in Latino voters . Due largely to demographic growth , the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016 , up from 11.2 million in 2012 . Even so , the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot , or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters , a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996 . Meanwhile , the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3 % in 2016 , up from 46.9 % in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996 . Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics : Overall , about 5 million Asians voted in 2016 , up from 3.8 million in 2012 . The number of naturalized - citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016 , up from 9.3 million in 2012 . In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign , turnout among naturalized - citizen voters ( those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens ) was 54.3 % , up from 53.6 % in 2012 . Overall , the voter turnout rate among foreign - born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters , who had a 62.1 % turnout rate in 2016 . But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation ’s two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed . In 2016 , turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9 % , compared with 44.9 % for U.S.-born Asians . Among Hispanics , naturalized - citizen turnout was 53.4 % , higher than the 45.5 % turnout for U.S.-born Hispanics .","Describe how different ethnic groups share of voters change since 2012 ?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1201.png","Clinton's views are liberal to many but supporters say she's more moderate Hillary Clinton's views can best be described as","Supporters and opponents see Clinton ’s political views differently .

First , there are strong differences in views about using these technologies for enhancement depending on how religious people are . In general , the most religious are the most wary about potential enhancements . For example , those who score high on a three - item index of religious commitment1 are more likely than those who are lower in religious commitment to say all three types of enhancement – gene editing to give babies a lifetime with much reduced risk of disease , brain chip implants to give people much improved cognitive abilities and transfusions with synthetic blood to give people much improved physical capacities – would be meddling with nature and crossing a line that should not be crossed . Americans who have lower levels of religious commitment are more inclined to see the potential use of these techniques as just the continuation of a centuries - old quest by humans to try to better themselves .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1206.png","Women make up about a third of current U.S. ambassadors","Currently , about a third ( 36 % ) of assigned American ambassadors are women .

The ranks of both Irish and Scotch - Irish Americans have fallen a lot in the past two - and - a - half decades , and the trend does not appear likely to reverse .

About three - quarters ( 73 % ) of women said it ’s easier for men to get elected to high political office , while 58 % of men agreed . And 38 % of women said that having more women in top political or business leadership positions would improve the quality of life for all women “ a lot . ” Only half as many men ( 19 % ) agreed . There were similar differences by political party on this question , with more than twice as many Democrats ( 39 % ) as Republicans ( 17 % ) saying that having more women in high political office would improve the lives of women , while independents ( 28 % ) ranked in the middle . In 2015 , there were 104 women in Congress , a record number representing 19 % of all Senate and House seats . There was no overall consensus among the public in our survey on what holds women back from gaining top elective offices , though women were far more likely than men to cite societal and institutional factors as major reasons . About half ( 47 % ) of women said that a major reason there are not more women in top political offices is that female candidates are held to higher standards than men , compared with 28 % of men who said so . Four - in - ten women ( 41 % ) , compared with three - in - ten men ( 31 % ) , said that a major reason for the lack of women in top political offices is that many Americans are n’t ready to elect a woman to a higher office . And 33 % of women , compared with 21 % of men , said that females getting less support from party leaders is a major reason . Relatively small shares of men ( 15 % ) and women ( 18 % ) said that family responsibilities are a major reason that fewer women hold elective offices . There were generational differences among women in our survey on the attributes that a woman brings to political office . Younger women were less likely to give female leaders an edge over male leaders , and instead were more likely to say men and women are equally likely to possess certain traits . For example , when it comes to working out compromises , 33 % of Millennial women and 37 % of Generation X women said women are better than men , compared with about half of women from the Baby Boomer ( 47 % ) and Silent ( 50 % ) generations who said so .

Although this means that a majority of these regular ride - hailing users are car owners / drivers , they are significantly less likely to own or drive a car than either occasional ride - hailing users or Americans who do not use ride - hailing at all . Yet although they are less dependent on personal vehicle ownership , these regular ride - hailing users rely heavily on a wide range of personal transportation options that go well beyond ride - hailing alone – such as taking public transit , walking or riding a bike , or even using traditional taxi services . To be sure , this trend carries a strong geographic component : For Americans who live far from urban centers , a personal vehicle might be the only available option to get from one place to another . But for those with the option of doing so , ride - hailing apps can serve as one element among many in a network of transportation options that can help reduce users ’ reliance on personal vehicle ownership .","In 2016 , as in recent years , Millennials and Gen Xers were the most Democratic generations .

( The Scotch - Irish were mainly Ulster Protestants who migrated to the British colonies in the decades before independence , while Irish Catholics did n’t begin arriving in large numbers until the 1840s . ) By comparison , the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have a combined population of about 6.6 million . The ranks of both Irish and Scotch - Irish Americans have fallen a lot in the past two - and - a - half decades , and the trend does not appear likely to reverse . Two decades ago , in 1990 , 38.7 million Americans ( 15.6 % of the total population ) claimed Irish ancestry , and 5.6 million ( 2.3 % ) identified as Scotch - Irish","But while most Americans see the U.S. as the global economic and military leader , many also said the U.S. is not quite as powerful a player on the world stage as it used to be . In a separate survey , nearly half of Americans ( 46 % ) said the U.S. plays a less important and powerful role now than a decade ago , compared with 31 % who said its role is still as important and 21 % who saw it as having increased in importance","Women in our survey said men had an easier path to political leadership , and they also were more likely to say that having more female leaders would improve the quality of life for women . About three - quarters ( 73 % ) of women said it ’s easier for men to get elected to high political office , while 58 % of men agreed . And 38 % of women said that having more women in top political or business leadership positions would improve the quality of life for all women “ a lot . ” Only half as many men ( 19 % ) agreed . There were similar differences by political party on this question , with more than twice as many Democrats ( 39 % ) as Republicans ( 17 % ) saying that having more women in high political office would improve the lives of women , while independents ( 28 % ) ranked in the middle . In 2015 , there were 104 women in Congress , a record number representing 19 % of all Senate and House seats . There was no overall consensus among the public in our survey on what holds women back from gaining top elective offices , though women were far more likely than men to cite societal and institutional factors as major reasons . About half ( 47 % ) of women said that a major reason there are not more women in top political offices is that female candidates are held to higher standards than men , compared with 28 % of men who said so . Four - in - ten women ( 41 % ) , compared with three - in - ten men ( 31 % ) , said that a major reason for the lack of women in top political offices is that many Americans are n’t ready to elect a woman to a higher office . And 33 % of women , compared with 21 % of men , said that females getting less support from party leaders is a major reason . Relatively small shares of men ( 15 % ) and women ( 18 % ) said that family responsibilities are a major reason that fewer women hold elective offices . There were generational differences among women in our survey on the attributes that a woman brings to political office . Younger women were less likely to give female leaders an edge over male leaders , and instead were more likely to say men and women are equally likely to possess certain traits . For example , when it comes to working out compromises , 33 % of Millennial women and 37 % of Generation X women said women are better than men , compared with about half of women from the Baby Boomer ( 47 % ) and Silent ( 50 % ) generations who said so . Asked about which gender is better at working to improve Americans ’ quality of life , only 22 % of Millennial women and 24 % of Gen X women said female leaders are better , compared with 39 % of Baby Boomer women and 35 % of Silent generation women who said so .","Some 3 % of American adults use ride - hailing apps on a daily or weekly basis , and around two - thirds of these regular ride - hailing users indicate that they own a car or regularly drive a personal vehicle . Although this means that a majority of these regular ride - hailing users are car owners / drivers , they are significantly less likely to own or drive a car than either occasional ride - hailing users or Americans who do not use ride - hailing at all . Yet although they are less dependent on personal vehicle ownership , these regular ride - hailing users rely heavily on a wide range of personal transportation options that go well beyond ride - hailing alone – such as taking public transit , walking or riding a bike , or even using traditional taxi services . To be sure , this trend carries a strong geographic component : For Americans who live far from urban centers , a personal vehicle might be the only available option to get from one place to another . But for those with the option of doing so , ride - hailing apps can serve as one element among many in a network of transportation options that can help reduce users ’ reliance on personal vehicle ownership","How is the U.S global role seen?","How are men still being favored by the gender gap?","How willing are Americans to be car owners nowadays?"

For roughly 15 years , independent studies suggested that the answer to that question was generally “ no ” if the goal was to make accurate population estimates.1 Over time , though , researchers and sample vendors have developed technologies and statistical techniques aimed at improving the representativeness of online nonprobability surveys . Several recent case studies suggest a future ( some would argue a present ) in which researchers need not have an expensive , probability - based sample to make accurate population estimates . Nearly all of the questions ( 52 ) were also asked on waves of the Center ’s probability - based American Trends Panel ( ATP ) , which is conducted predominantly online but features mail response for adults who do not have internet access . The samples were evaluated using a range of metrics , including estimated bias on 20 full sample survey estimates for which high quality government benchmarks are available , estimated bias for major demographic subgroup estimates , and predictive accuracy of four different regression models .
