But majorities of Americans harbor at least some reservations about the impact on society of more widespread use of gene editing, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Roughly six-in-ten Americans (58%) say one very likely negative effect that will result from gene editing is that it will increase inequality because it will only be available for the wealthy. Another 54% express concern that, even if gene editing is appropriate for certain purposes, it will lead to a slippery slope, with some using it in morally unacceptable ways. Far fewer Americans see upsides if gene editing for babies were to become widely available. About one-in-five (18%) consider it very likely that gene editing would pave the way for new medical advances that benefit society, and 16% have a similar degree of confidence that it would help people live longer and better quality lives. Roughly a third or more consider each of these as not too or not at all likely to transpire.","What are the views of the world on gene editing?","initial/no_data/23.png","5 facts about the death penalty","Support for the death penalty in the U.S. has ticked up recently, but is far lower than it was two decades ago. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May 2018 found that 54% of Americans favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39% oppose it. That was up from 2016, when 49% of U.S. adults said they favored the death penalty, compared with 42% who opposed it. But it was far lower than in 1996, when 78% of Americans supported capital punishment for those convicted of murder.","How do americans view the death penalty?","initial/no_data/24.png","Most Americans say another round of COVID-19 economic relief will be needed","Following the passage of a second stimulus package in December in response to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, 79% of U.S. adults say another economic assistance package will be necessary. Just 20% say another package will not be needed. The level of support for an additional package today is nearly identical to the share of Americans (80%) who said more coronavirus aid was needed in the weeks leading up to passage of a $900 billion stimulus bill late last year, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. While majorities of both Republicans and Democrats say they think another economic assistance package will be necessary, Republicans are less likely to say this.","initial/no_data/25.png","5 facts about economic inequality in 2014","By one measure, U.S. income inequality is the highest it's been since 1928. In 1982, the highest-earning 1% of families received 10.8% of all pretax income, while the bottom 90% received 64.7%, according to research by UC-Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez. Three decades later, according to Saez' preliminary estimates for 2012, the top 1% received 22.5% of pretax income, while the bottom 90%'s share had fallen to 49.6%.","initial/no_data/26.png","Americans see growing gap between rich and poor","The issue of income inequality is back in the news at a time when the U.S. public believes there is a growing gulf between rich and poor that is likely to continue, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys. President Obama focused on the issue in a Wednesday speech in which he said there was a dangerous and growing inequality in the nation which now stood as the defining challenge of our time. A substantial majority of Americans (65%) said in an July 2012 Pew Research survey that they believed the income gap between the rich and poor had widened over the last decade. Just 20% said it had stayed the same and 7% said it was smaller. Most of those (57%) who believed the gap had grown said it was a bad thing for society.","safe.
