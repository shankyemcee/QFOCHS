Two decades ago , the average partisan differences on these items were only somewhat wider than differences by religious attendance or educational attainment and about as wide as the differences between blacks and whites ( 14 points , on average ) . Today , the party divide is much wider than any of these demographic differences .","Several initiatives have emerged recently to help newsrooms connect with the public , build trust and do a better job of bringing citizens ’ voices into the news . But the news media have a long way to go , according to new data from Pew Research Center . Just 5 % of the more than 3,000 news stories studied during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency cited a member of the public , one of nine source types analyzed . Along the same lines , only 4 % of all stories cited public opinion polls , another way Americans ’ views and attitudes get represented . Across the five main topic areas , the highest citation of polls was in stories about the president ’s political skills ( 9 % ) and health care ( 8 % ) . There was , however , one type of news programming that gave far more voice to members of the public than any other : network evening news . In the time period studied , the four network evening news programs ( ABC , CBS , NBC and PBS ) were at least four times as likely as cable , digital or radio programming to cite at least one citizen in their stories – 17 % compared with 4 % or less among the other three formats . Network newscasts were as likely to cite poll numbers as other platforms , and were less likely to cite another journalist or news organization – 12 % compared with 30 % or more among the other platforms .","The gap between television and online news consumption is narrowing . As of August 2017 , 43 % of Americans report often getting news online , a share just 7 percentage points lower than the 50 % who often get news on television . The gap between the two news platforms was 19 points in early 2016 , more than twice as large . The share of Americans who often get news from TV – whether from local TV news , nightly network TV news or cable news – has fallen , while the portion of Americans often getting news online – either from news websites / apps or social media – has grown","Describe details as partisan divides over political values widen, other gaps remain more modest?","Tell some information about Network TV more likely to cite citizens?","What are some information about gap between television and online news consumption narrows from 2016?"

For some – especially those with high levels of educational attainment – technology represents a largely positive force that makes their work more interesting and provides opportunities for career advancement . But those who have not attended college are much less likely to view today ’s workforce technologies in such a positive light .

By comparison , about half of whites ( 52 % ) said racism is a big problem in our society , up from 22 % in 2009 . There were also partisan divides on this question , which have grown from 2015 .","Compare the portions of blacks and whites who think racism is a big problem in the society today.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/614.png","Hispanics, panelists the likely young, and more mobile panelists less likely to be found on the voter files % ofeach group that matches to o files 1 file 2-4 files All 5 files","Researchers were able to match a very high percentage of panelists from the nationally representative survey sample to at least one of the five commercial voter files , suggesting that the files collectively cover a large share of the U.S. population . Depending on the voter file vendor , the percentage of panelists matched varied from a low of 50 % to a high of 79 % , with an average match rate of 69 % . Less than half ( 42 % ) of the panelists were located in all five files , but each of the vendors “ found ” panelists missed by other vendors . Differences among the vendors are largely a function of their tolerance for mismatches and , presumably , the success of their matching algorithms . Collectively , the vendors successfully matched 91 % of panelists , meaning that more than nine - in - ten panelists could be found on at least one of the files and just 9 % of panelists could not be found on any of the files . The relatively high level of coverage of the files is encouraging for researchers and campaigns that use them for targeting , messaging or research . Of course , most clients using these voter files will not have purchased all five of them , so match rates of 90 % and higher may be difficult if not impossible to achieve with any single file . Still , commercial voter files may disproportionately miss segments of the public who are politically disengaged , younger , Hispanic and more mobile . Specifically , the likelihood of finding an individual on a commercial voter file was strongly related to whether they were registered to vote . On average across the five vendors , 77 % of people who said they were registered to vote were matched . Only 38 % of the self - described unregistered voters were matched . Similarly , match rates varied greatly by panelists ’ age , race and ethnicity . Only about one - in - five younger panelists ( 22 % of those ages 18 to 29 ) were found in all five files , as compared to more than half ( 59 % ) of older panelists ( ages 65 and older ) . Similarly , just 26 % of Hispanics were found in all five files , compared with 47 % of non - Hispanic whites . 2 Mobility is also a strong correlate . Only 14 % of those who reported moving in the last year were found on all five files .

By contrast , the share of Democrats who view the Department of Justice favorably has declined from 74 % to 60 % since then . Republicans also are more favorable toward the Federal Reserve and the VA today compared with last year : Currently , about two - thirds of Republicans give a positive rating ( 65 % ) to the Fed , up from about half ( 51 % ) one year ago . And a 56 % majority of Republicans view the VA favorably ; last year , just 40 % said the same .

Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau ’s report , the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters . The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election , falling to 59.6 % in 2016 after reaching a record - high 66.6 % in 2012 . The 7 - percentage - point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks . ( It ’s also the largest percentage - point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2 % in 1992 to 60.7 % in 1996 . ) The number of black voters also declined , falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016 , representing a sharp reversal from 2012 . With Barack Obama on the ballot that year , the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time . Among whites , the 65.3 % turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1 % in 2012 . The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6 % in 2016 , compared with 48.0 % in 2012 . Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long - awaited , historic surge in Latino voters . Due largely to demographic growth , the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016 , up from 11.2 million in 2012 . Even so , the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot , or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters , a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996 . Meanwhile , the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3 % in 2016 , up from 46.9 % in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996 . Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics : Overall , about 5 million Asians voted in 2016 , up from 3.8 million in 2012 . The number of naturalized - citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016 , up from 9.3 million in 2012 . In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign , turnout among naturalized - citizen voters ( those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens ) was 54.3 % , up from 53.6 % in 2012 . Overall , the voter turnout rate among foreign - born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters , who had a 62.1 % turnout rate in 2016 . But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation ’s two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed . In 2016 , turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9 % , compared with 44.9 % for U.S.-born Asians .

Thus , the income it takes to be middle class varies across countries . Also , estimates in the new report will not match those in the Center ’s previous reports , which were based on a household ’s gross ( pretax ) income . Among Western Europe ’s six largest economies , the shares of adults living in middle - income households increased in France , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , but they shrank in Germany , Italy and Spain .

Among the 11 Western European countries examined , the expansion in the UK was second only to the increase in Ireland , where the share increased from 60 % in 1991 to 69 % in 2010 . The decrease in Germany was the second largest after Finland , where the middle - class share fell from 82 % to 75 % over the same period . Overall , the middle - class share of the adult population fell in seven of the 11 Western European countries examined , mirroring the long - term shrinking of the middle class in the U.S. In most countries studied , decreasing shares of middle - income populations led to rising shares of adults in lower- and upper - income tiers . These shifts signal a sharpening of economic divisions among households in many Western European countries and the U.S. However , there is also a general improvement in the economic status of adults because the movement up the income ladder was greater than the movement downward in most countries from 1991 to 2010 . Compared with Western Europe , the U.S. middle class is smaller . Among the countries examined , the U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six - in - ten adults were in the middle class in 2010 . Meanwhile , compared with many Western European countries , greater shares of Americans were either lower income ( 26 % ) or upper income ( 15 % ) . Thus , U.S. households were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries analyzed . In the Western European countries , middle - class shares in 2010 ranged from 64 % in Spain to 80 % in Denmark and Norway . The share of adults who were lower income was lowest in the Netherlands ( 13 % ) and highest in Spain ( 24 % ) , and upper - income shares ranged from 6 % in Norway to 14 % in the UK .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/876.png","The shares of adults living in middle-income households fell in many countries in Western Europe % of adults living in middle- income households in1991 and 2010 80 Norway","The fortunes of the middle classes in Western Europe ’s largest economies are moving in opposite directions .

As previous research has shown , Republicans and Democrats hardly see eye to eye in their views of the news media and President Trump – a split that extends to how often members of each party connect these actors to made - up news . Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the news media comes to mind when thinking of made - up news : 23 % of Republicans and GOP - leaning independents say this , compared with 15 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents , an 8 - percentage - point difference . Among those who mention a specific news outlet , Republicans are more likely to mention CNN ( 6 % vs. less than 1 % ) while Democrats are more likely to mention Fox News ( 7 % vs. 1 % ) .

The share among newer arrivals has grown since 2010 , when 36 % had a college degree , compared with 25 % of longer - tenured immigrants .

As in past surveys , most also view the right to nonviolent protest ( 79 % ) and protecting the rights of those with unpopular views ( 74 % ) as very important components of a strong democracy .

By roughly two - to - one , Republicans and Republican - leaning independents are more likely to say financial regulations have gone too far ( 63 % ) than to say they have not gone far enough ( 31 % ) . The balance of opinion among Democrats and Democratic leaners is reversed : More than twice as many Democrats say the government has not gone far enough in this area ( 62 % ) as say it has gone too far ( 29 % ) .

For example , during the 1960s the female labor force grew , on average , three times faster than the male labor force – 3.1 % per year versus 1.0 % per year . By 2000 , 59.9 % of women were in the labor force , up from 37.7 % in 1960 . This rapid growth boosted women ’s representation in the work force overall . The steady growth in women ’s labor force representation slowed in the 1990s as women ’s participation peaked .

( The labor force can grow in spite of falling labor force participation because the working - age population is increasing . ) Looking forward , the BLS projections assume labor force participation will continue to decline for both men and women at similar rates .
