Three - quarters of Americans said that Obama was the candidate they had heard most about in the news . This compares with only 10 % who named McCain .

Among the 13 nations included in the analysis , Brazilian Catholics have the highest religiosity score ( 2.45 ) , and the top six spots all belong to Latin American countries . Latin American Catholics tend to cluster in the upper left of the chart , indicating their low levels of wealth and high levels of religiosity , while those in Western Europe show up in the lower right as the result of their prosperity and lower scores on the religiosity index . Most countries appear in the chart about where their stage of economic development would predict .

Another 9 % say they followed news about the Sept. 11 anniversary most closely . The media devoted 15 % of the newshole last week to news dealing with anti - Muslim sentiments . Most of that ( 14 % ) focused on Pastor Terry Jones ’ plans and the push to get him to cancel the Koran burning , according to the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ )","Americans paid close attention last week to three story lines with links to the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 .

And when cell phones , email , social networks and podcasts are added in , 44 % of Americans say they got news through one or more internet or mobile digital source yesterday . At the same time , the proportion of Americans who get news from traditional media platforms – television , radio and print – has been stable or edging downward in the last few years . There has been no overall decline in the percentage saying they watched news on television , and even with the continued erosion of print newspaper and radio audiences , three - quarters of Americans got news yesterday from one or more of these three traditional platforms",". Interest was somewhat higher in news about a government proposal to overhaul national financial regulations ; 17 % of the public followed the story very closely , while 3 % called it their top story .","In other news , with the 4,000th U.S. military death in Iraq and renewed violence in the country , news coverage of the Iraq war increased last week . The media devoted 12 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq","In order to compare the religiosity of Catholic publics in Europe , Latin America , and the U.S. , we constructed an index based on three questions : whether faith in God is necessary for living a moral life , the importance of religion in respondents ’ lives , and a how often respondents pray.2 The scale ranges from “ 0 , ” the least religious position , to “ 3 , ” the most religious position . Among the 13 nations included in the analysis , Brazilian Catholics have the highest religiosity score ( 2.45 ) , and the top six spots all belong to Latin American countries . Latin American Catholics tend to cluster in the upper left of the chart , indicating their low levels of wealth and high levels of religiosity , while those in Western Europe show up in the lower right as the result of their prosperity and lower scores on the religiosity index . Most countries appear in the chart about where their stage of economic development would predict . For example , on this chart , Argentina does not look like an outlier ; instead , it falls precisely where it should given its comparative wealth in relation to other Latin American nations .","How were the public following news stories about the Beijing Olympics when the 2008 Campaign and Situation in Iraq were the main topics?","How topic-divided were mediatic coverage toward the stories happening at the same time of the 2008 Campaign?","Describe the methodology used for comparing Catholicism over different societies?"

In the current poll , Obama is by far the candidate that the public has been hearing the most about in the news . Fully , 70 % have heard more about Obama in the last week than any other candidate . This is consistent with the balance of the press coverage , according to the Campaign Coverage Index conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism . Last week , Obama was the featured news maker in 72 % of all campaign news stories , his highest coverage level this year . Only 15 % said that Sen. Clinton was the candidate they have been hearing the most about . The gap between Obama ’s and Clinton ’s visibility has grown substantially over the last two weeks from roughly equal visibility in early March , when 38 % had been hearing most about Obama , 37 % about Clinton . The drop in Clinton ’s public visibility is also consistent with the amount of coverage her campaign received in recent weeks . The share of campaign coverage in which Clinton was the featured candidate fell from 60 % three weeks ago to 51 % in the following week and down to 30 % this past week , according to the Campaign Coverage Index conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism . Though John McCain has sewn up the Republican nomination , he continues to lag far behind Obama and Clinton in public visibility . Only 3 % of the public named John McCain as the candidate they heard most about in the news recently .

Those in the top income tiers paid closer attention to news about the Bear Stearns buyout than did those with lower annual incomes . Among those earning $ 75,000 annually , 27 % reported following this story very closely compared to 17 % of those earning between $ 30,000 and $ 49,999 and 16 % of those earning less than $ 30,000 .

The national news media devoted 3 % of its overall coverage to events in Iraq and 5 % to the Iraq policy debate . There was relatively little public interest in violent protests in Tibet against the Chinese government . Overall , just 12 % say they paid very close attention to this story , roughly equal to the number who followed the news about pro - democracy protests in Burma last fall ( 13 % followed Burma very closely ) .

News about the economy – at 13 % most closely – also drew more interest than the Sherrod story . A separate analysis by Pew Research ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) finds that reports on Sherrod ’s firing accounted for 14 % of all coverage last week , but as much as 28 % of coverage on July 21 , after it became clear that the video posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart took Sherrod ’s comments about race out of context .

A 59 % majority of Americans believe that , in the long run , the failures of the Bush administration will outweigh the accomplishments , up from 53 % a year ago . Half as many ( 28 % ) say Bush ’s accomplishments will outweigh his failures . By comparison , in January 2004 — at the outset of Bush ’s re - election campaign — more saw the administrations accomplishments carrying more weight ( 49 % ) than its failures ( 36 % ) .

Only one difference is as large as 7 points , while four others are 5 points and seven are 4 points . The coverage problem in landline surveys is mostly caused by the cell - only households . But as noted by Blumberg and Luke1 , people who have both a landline and cell phone , but are highly dependent on their cell phones for communication , may be underrepresented in surveys that include only the landline population and cell - only users . To disentangle these effects , we also computed estimates of the difference between landline samples and landline samples that include cell - only households ( as opposed to all adults reached by cell phone ) . For the most part , the patterns of difference are the same as those seen in the comparison of landline and full dual frame surveys . But they are slightly smaller in magnitude : only four differences are four points or larger ( compared with 12 for the landline vs. full dual frame comparison ) , and the average size of differences is 1.6 percentage points , vs. 2.1 percentage points for the full dual frame comparison .","Discuss some details of comparison between landline plus cell phones and landline ones, which had the lowest point differences.","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3001.png","- 8-29","Bias is not the only potential problem arising from survey non - coverage . Because the decline of landline coverage has not been uniform across demographic groups , some key subgroups in surveys based only on landlines may be severely underrepresented , making reliable estimates of attitudes or behaviors among those groups difficult or impossible to obtain . For example , respondents ages 18 - 29 now constitute just 7 % of a typical landline sample , less than one - third of their proper proportion in the population according to the latest American Community Survey estimates ( 22 % ) . The shortfall is not limited just to the very young , in part because many people maintain phone status as they age , and in part because even older adults are abandoning landline service . Consequently , the percentage of adults in their 30s and 40s represented in landline surveys now falls 12 percentage points short of the parameters ( 26 % vs. 38 % ) .

The war in Iraq was the most closely followed news story — 26 % of the public followed news of the war very closely and 20 % listed this as their most closely followed story . The shooting at a Cleveland , Ohio high school attracted only moderate interest . The incident , which resulted in the death of the shooter but no other fatalities , was followed very closely by 22 % of the public and 17 % listed this as their most closely followed story . Interest in this shooting was much lower than previous school shootings many of which had been followed very closely by nearly 50 % of the public . The national news media devoted 4 % of its overall coverage to the shootings , the bulk of which was on network and cable television news . The media focused heavily on the 2008 presidential campaign — devoting 15 % of its coverage to campaign - related news .

The shortfall is not limited just to the very young , in part because many people maintain phone status as they age , and in part because even older adults are abandoning landline service . Consequently , the percentage of adults in their 30s and 40s represented in landline surveys now falls 12 percentage points short of the parameters ( 26 % vs. 38 % ) .

During a week in which George Bush vetoed Congress ’s war - funding bill , the Iraq policy debate also attracted a good deal of public interest : 30 % followed the debate very closely ( up from 18 % the previous week ) and 13 % listed it as their most closely followed story . Media coverage of the war focused more on the policy debate than events on the ground . The 2008 presidential campaign was the most heavily covered news story last week — making up 13 % of the overall newshole . Nearly one quarter of the public ( 23 % ) followed campaign news very closely and 11 % said it was the story they followed most closely last week . In spite of the GOP candidates ’ May 3 debate , Democrats followed the campaign more closely than Republicans . The release of George Tenet ’s book about his experiences as CIA director attracted little public interest in spite of a significant amount of media coverage . Only 9 % of the public followed news of Tenet ’s book very closely and 3 % listed this as their most closely followed story . The book release received relatively little coverage in newspapers or online news sources , but it was heavily covered on television and radio news . Nearly 10 % of the coverage on network TV news ( 9 % ) , cable TV news ( 8 % ) and radio news ( 9 % ) was devoted to Tenet ’s book .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3429.png","Mothers and Fathers Have it Harder Today Than Parents of 20- 30 Years Ago","Overall , 70 % of Americans say that mothers today have a more difficult job than mothers did 20 or 30 years ago .

Fully 45 % of Americans paid very close attention to the tragedy and 56 % said it was the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week . However , interest in the Virginia Tech shootings was considerably lower than interest in the Columbine High School shootings which occurred almost exactly eight years earlier . More than two - thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) paid very close attention to the Columbine incident . Interest in the Virginia Tech shootings was on a par with school shootings that took place in the fall of 2006 ( including the shooting at an Amish school house in Pennsylvania ) , as well as the 1998 shootings at a middle school in Jonesboro , Arkansas and a high school in Springfield Oregon . In a busy news week , the public ’s focus was primarily on the events in Blacksburg , Virginia . While interest in the situation in Iraq was substantial , the war did not dominate the public ’s attention this past week as it has throughout most of the year . Only 13 % said they followed the events in Iraq more closely than any other news story . Neither Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’s testimony before Congress concerning the firing of eight U.S. attorneys nor the Supreme Court ’s abortion ruling put a dent in the Virginia Tech audience . Only 4 % of the public named either of these stories as the one they followed most closely last week . The Virginia Tech shootings attracted more public interest and received more news coverage than any other story this year . Fully 51 % of all news coverage for the week was devoted to the Virginia Tech shootings and its aftermath . Cable news led the way devoting 76 % of its coverage to the story . More than 60 % of network television news focused on this story , as did half of all radio news . The public relied mainly on television for news about the shootings : 36 % say their main source of information about the story was cable news and another 32 % say they relied primarily on network TV news . The Internet was the main source of news on the shootings for 11 % of the public , while 9 % relied mainly on newspapers and another 9 % relied on radio .","Two - thirds of Americans ( 66 % ) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy , which is little changed since early February ( 61 % ) or early January ( 65 % ) . Meanwhile , the number that says they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy now stands at 30 % . It had been 35 % at the start of February and 29 % in early January . Just 4 % say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy , essentially unchanged from earlier in the year . When asked about specific elements of the economy , Americans are most likely to say they are hearing bad news about the employment picture . The federal government announced March 5 that the unemployment rate was 9.7 % in February , unchanged from January . Currently , 59 % say they are hearing mostly bad news about the jobs situation , about the same as the 61 % that said this in January .","About three - in - ten ( 31 % ) say they followed news about widespread local and state budget problems very closely","Americans say the two news stories they followed most closely last week were the reinvigorated debate over health care reform in Washington and the second week of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver .

A comparable number ( 24 % ) say they followed the Winter Olympics most closely , according to the latest News Interest Index survey , conducted Feb. 26 - March 1 among 1,008 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press . The health care debate dominated news coverage last week , making up 24 % of the newshole , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism . Among the other top stories were the economic crisis ( 11 % of coverage ) , Toyota ’s continuing problems ( 10 % ) and the Olympics ( 7 % ) .","With the Virginia Tech shootings falling off of the national news media ’s agenda last week , the public shifted its focus back to the Iraq war .

Four years after its victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections , Hamas receives relatively positive ratings in Jordan ( 56 % favorable ) and Egypt ( 52 % ) . However , Palestinians are more likely to give the group a negative ( 52 % ) than a positive ( 44 % ) rating . And reservations about Hamas are particularly common in the portion of the Palestinian territories it controls — just 37 % in Gaza express a favorable opinion , compared with 47 % in the West Bank . A survey conducted May 18 to June 16 , 2009 by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project also finds limited support for the Lebanese Shia organization Hezbollah.1 While most Palestinians ( 61 % ) and about half of Jordanians ( 51 % ) have a favorable view of Hezbollah , elsewhere opinions are less positive , including Egypt ( 43 % ) and Lebanon ( 35 % ) . As with many issues in Lebanon , views of Hezbollah are sharply divided along religious lines : nearly all of the country ’s Shia Muslims ( 97 % ) express a positive opinion of the organization , while only 18 % of Christians and 2 % of Sunni Muslims feel this way . Meanwhile , Turks overwhelmingly reject both groups — just 5 % give Hamas a positive rating and only 3 % say this about Hezbollah . There is also little support among Israel ’s Arab population for either Hamas ( 21 % favorable ) or Hezbollah ( 27 % ) .

In nine nations , Muslim respondents were asked whether the tensions between Sunnis and Shia are limited to Iraq or are a growing problem in the Muslim world more generally , and in seven of those nations , a majority of Muslims say it is a broader problem . This is a rare point of agreement among Muslims in Lebanon , a country that has experienced considerable sectarian conflict for decades . Overall , 95 % of Lebanese Muslims Sunni - Shia tensions are a broad problem in the Muslim world , including 99 % of Sunnis and 91 % of Shia . Most Pakistani , Egyptian , Jordanian and Nigerian Muslims also see a general problem that is not limited to Iraq . Israel ’s Muslim minority community is roughly divided on this question — 42 % say it is a more general problem , while 38 % feel it is limited to Iraq .

The media , on the other hand , gave the most coverage to the president ’s speech ( 19 % ) and news about the economic crisis ( 18 % ) , according to the separate analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .

But the recent overall decline in Republican Party affiliation nationwide has taken a toll even on GOP support among affluent voters . The latest Pew surveys find Democrats pulling even with Republicans among registered voters with annual family incomes in excess of roughly $ 135,000 per annum . Overall , while remarkably high voter enthusiasm is undoubtedly the key factor in the Democratic Party ’s fundraising success in 2006 and thus far this year , the pool of potential campaign donors is also less tilted toward the GOP today than it has been in the past . Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past 13 years reveals a stark change in the party identification among the wealthiest voters – defined here as those in the top 10 % of household incomes . In 1995 , the year after the Republicans took control of the House and Senate , there were nearly twice as many Republicans ( 46 % ) as Democrats ( 25 % ) among the most affluent 10 % of registered voters ( household incomes of approximately $ 84,000 or more at the time ) . By comparison , there are just as many Democrats ( 31 % ) as Republicans ( 32 % ) among this class of voters today ( household incomes of approximately $ 135,000 or more ) . As has been the case nationwide , the shifting balance has had more to do with Republican losses than Democratic gains . Within the past two years , Republican Party identification has fallen nine percentage points among the wealthiest voters ( from 41 % to 32 % ) , while Democratic identification is up just three points . This mirrors the overall pattern nationwide , which shows a sizeable decline in GOP identification , and only modest growth in Democratic Party identification .

Over this same period , public calls for stricter gun - control laws have also quieted somewhat . A recent Pew nationwide survey found a 52%-to-32 % majority of respondents holding a favorable opinion of the NRA , which will hold its massive annual convention on April 13 - 15 this year in St. Louis . While this is the first time since 1994 that the favorability rating of the group has crossed the 50 % mark , positive views of the NRA have been inching upward in Pew polls in recent years .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3439.png","Should laws covering the sale of firearms be.","As attitudes toward the NRA have warmed , attitudes toward more restrictive gun control have cooled . In September 1990 , 78 % of respondents in a national survey told Gallup they felt that laws governing the sale of firearms should be stricter . The figure declined throughout the 1990s and reached its lowest point ( 51 % ) in October 2002 . Since then support for stricter controls on guns has hovered in the mid-50s , reaching a peak of 60 % in 2004 . Most recently , in October 2006 , 56 % of people told Gallup they favored stricter gun - sales laws . However , when given the choice in that poll between enforcing current gun laws more strictly or doing that plus passing new gun laws , most people ( 53 % ) preferred only that current laws be enforced more strictly .","Across predominantly Muslim nations , there is little enthusiasm for the extremist Islamic organizations Hamas and Hezbollah , although there are pockets of support for both groups , especially in the Middle East . Four years after its victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections , Hamas receives relatively positive ratings in Jordan ( 56 % favorable ) and Egypt ( 52 % ) . However , Palestinians are more likely to give the group a negative ( 52 % ) than a positive ( 44 % ) rating . And reservations about Hamas are particularly common in the portion of the Palestinian territories it controls — just 37 % in Gaza express a favorable opinion , compared with 47 % in the West Bank","Overall , 95 % of Lebanese Muslims Sunni - Shia tensions are a broad problem in the Muslim world , including 99 % of Sunnis and 91 % of Shia . Most Pakistani , Egyptian , Jordanian and Nigerian Muslims also see a general problem that is not limited to Iraq . Israel ’s Muslim minority community is roughly divided on this question — 42 % say it is a more general problem , while 38 % feel it is limited to Iraq . Indonesia is the outlier on this question — 25 % of Indonesian Muslims say Sunni - Shia tensions are a general problem , while almost half ( 47 % ) think it is essentially a problem for Iraq ( 28 % offer no opinion ) .","In a week when the media focused heavily on Barack Obama ’s first State of the Union address and the state of the economy , Americans continued to track news about the earthquake in Haiti more closely than any other major news story .

But the lead up to the invasion of Iraq produced a typical rally around the president in times of foreign crisis that kept Bush ’s approval ratings quite healthy . America ’s quick and relatively painless Gulf War victory sent his approval scores to record highs in the first quarter of 1991 obviating the political impact of a steady rise in unemployment … but not for long . Over the course of the remainder of the year , Bush ’s approval rating tumbled , falling from a high of 86 % in March to 50 % in December .

Bush ’s ratings were driven largely by the public ’s response to national security concerns . In the end , however , a spike in unemployment contributed to Bush ’s leaving office with one of the lowest approval scores of the modern era . When Bush was inaugurated in January 2001 , unemployment stood at 4.2 % . The rate rose markedly following the Sept. 11 attacks , peaking at 6.3 % in June 2003 , not beginning a gradual decline until late that year .

In other top stories this week , the steady stream of news about the 2008 presidential campaign continued . Nine percent of news coverage in all sectors was devoted to this topic . For the past two months , media coverage of the campaign has focused largely on the two leading Democratic candidates , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama . That fact has not been lost on the public , as these two campaigns are at the forefront of the public ’s mind . When asked to name the candidate they ’ve heard the most about in the news lately , 37 % named Clinton and another 24 % named Barack Obama . Mentions of all other candidates were in single digits : 3 % or fewer named John McCain , Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney and John Edwards .

Two weeks earlier , when stocks took a dramatic tumble , the public was following the market somewhat more closely . Stock market happenings drew in a distinct audience – Republicans and men were among the most likely to pay close attention to this story . In addition , the income gap on this story is substantial . Fully 57 % of those with annual household incomes of $ 75,000 or higher followed news about the stock market very or fairly closely .

But the lead up to the invasion of Iraq produced a typical rally around the president in times of foreign crisis that kept Bush ’s approval ratings quite healthy . America ’s quick and relatively painless Gulf War victory sent his approval scores to record highs in the first quarter of 1991 obviating the political impact of a steady rise in unemployment … but not for long . Over the course of the remainder of the year , Bush ’s approval rating tumbled , falling from a high of 86 % in March to 50 % in December . Over that period , the unemployment rate rose from 6.4 % to 7.3 % . For much of Clinton ’s first term , unemployment rates and public judgments of the president were not in close correspondence . Unemployment declined from above 7 % at the time he took office to 5.5 % by the end of 1994 . However , Clinton ’s ratings were quite mixed for much of this time reflecting political difficulties ( the collapse of health care reform , and bitter fights over his crime bill and economic packages ) , as well as controversies over his past personal and financial involvements . However , Clinton ’s ratings began to improve in the fall of 1995 as a result of a successful showdown with Newt Gingrich over a shutdown of the federal government .

This is on par with the number who cited news about the 2008 presidential candidates ( 13 % ) or the Super Bowl ( 11 % ) as the stories they followed most closely . The war in Iraq was the top story for the week of Feb. 5 , with 30 % following it most closely . Data collected since the start of the year suggest that the public and the press are often in agreement about the most important news stories of the day . The Iraq war has consistently been the top - ranked news story both in terms of public interest and press coverage . In the News Interest Index survey for the week of Feb. 5 ( conducted Feb. 9 - 12 ) , 30 % of Americans said the situation in Iraq was the story they followed most closely , nearly double the next highest story – winter weather . During that same week , 22 % of the news reported across a broad spectrum of media outlets was devoted to the Iraq war ( 12 % to the policy debate and 10 % to events on the ground ) , according to PEJ . The death of Anna Nicole Smith , which set off a classic media feeding frenzy , may be an instance where press coverage exceeded public demand . Eleven percent of the public said Smith ’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week ; 9 % of the week ’s news coverage was devoted to this topic . But because the death occurred mid - week , the full extent of news coverage is not accurately captured by that 9 % figure . In the two days immediately following Smith ’s death ( Feb. 8 - 9 ) , nearly a quarter of the news from all sectors ( 24 % ) was devoted to this story , and fully half of cable news was focused on Smith . The public reacted negatively to the abundance of coverage – 61 % feel that the Smith story received too much coverage , compared with just 8 % who think it should have received more . It seems that news coverage of the weather did not match the public ’s fascination with it . Record cold temperatures and dramatic snowstorms captured the interest of many Americans this past week – 17 % said the weather was their top story , while only 3 % of the news coverage was devoted to this topic .","About a quarter of the public ( 24 % ) say they very closely followed news about the deadly suicide bomb in Afghanistan on Dec. 30 that killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer ; 6 % say this was the story they followed most closely last week . The incident accounted for 3 % of coverage , according to PEJ .","About two - thirds of Americans ( 65 % ) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy . That ’s up six points from early December . About three - in - ten ( 29 % ) say they are hearing mostly bad news , not much different from the 33 % that said this in early December . Just 5 % say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy , about the same as the 7 % that said the same last month .","About six - in - ten ( 59 % ) say they expect a bill to pass this year , while 29 % predict a bill will not pass . This is little changed from mid - December , when 61 % expected a bill to pass and 34 % said a bill would not pass . Democrats are notably more likely to predict passage – 68 % say health care legislative will pass – than are independents ( 58 % ) or Republicans ( 50 % ) .","The shift in the distribution of Hispanic construction workers across regions is consistent with regional trends in the housing market . As shown in Figure 1 , trends in housing starts have differed across regions in the past three years . The Northeast and the South witnessed stronger growth in 2004 and 2005 in comparison with the Midwest and the West . Housing activity diminished in all regions starting in 2006 , but the level of activity remained strong in the Northeast and South . In particular , housing activity in the Northeast and the South was at about the same level near the end of 2006 as it was at the beginning of 2004 . However , housing starts in the Midwest and the West were well below the levels seen in early 2004 . Consequently , it is possible that at least some of the movement of Latino workers across regions was caused by variations in the housing market .","Overall , Iraq was the dominant news story this past week , both in terms of interest and coverage . Fully 36 % of Americans followed news about Iraq very closely , and 34 % said it was the story they followed most closely . One - fifth of the news coverage across five major media sectors was devoted to the Iraq policy debate and events on the ground . By comparison , 13 % of the public followed the Smith story very closely and 16 % said it was their top story .","Most Americans feel the press has gone overboard in covering the death of Anna Nicole Smith . Fully 61 % believe the Smith story has been overcovered , far more than the number saying that about any other recent story .

There is greater division of opinion , however , over whether social networking sites or internet blogs have been changes for the better or changes for the worse . Most see increasing racial and ethnic diversity as a change for the better , as well as increased surveillance and security measures and the broader range of news and entertainment options . But the public is divided over whether wider acceptance of gays and lesbians , cable news talk and opinion shows , and the growing number of people with money in the stock market are good or bad trends . Reality TV shows are , by a wide margin , the least popular trend tested in the poll ; 63 % say these shows have been a change for the worse .

Just 21 % of Americans say this is something they dislike in their political leaders . And a 62 % majority wants to see a willingness to compromise when it comes to the most important issues of the day , even from the political party that they think most capable of handling things . But at the same time , the American public also likes leaders with the courage of their convictions . While three - in - four like leaders who are willing to compromise , two - thirds also say they like politicians who stick to their positions , even if unpopular . Just 28 % find this to be a negative trait . This conflict between compromise and conviction comes to a head when people are asked which kind of leaders they admire most . A slim majority ( 51 % ) think more highly of political leaders who make compromises , while 40 % most admire those who stick to their positions . The appeal of compromise is linked to a general distaste for ideologues .

Rather , they are asked to imagine a ladder with ten steps , with 10 representing the highest possible quality of life for them and zero the lowest . Then they ’re asked which step of the ladder they feel they ’re on at the present time ; which step they were on five years ago ; and finally , which step they expect to be on five years from now . People are n’t asked to make “ better ” or “ worse ” judgments . They ’re simply asked to assign numerical ratings to their life at three different points in time . For example , in the 2006 Pew survey ( taken this summer ) , Americans on average gave a 6.1 score to their lives five years ago ; a 6.8 score to their present quality of life ; and a 7.8 score to the lives they expect to be leading five years from now .

That is what happened in 1994 , when Republicans won control of both houses of Congress . The nationwide GOP congressional vote spiked by more than 9 million votes from 1990 , the biggest increase in one party ’s vote from one midterm to another since World War II . Meanwhile , the Democratic total declined by 400,000 votes . Another way to produce a big change in Congress is a “ one - party collapse , ” where a huge number of voters from one of the parties simply sit out the election . That is what happened in 1974 , when the dispiriting backdrop of the Watergate scandal led to a nearly 3 - million vote falloff in the Republican House vote from 1970 . The Democratic vote grew by barely 1 million . But the GOP drop off was so severe that it cost the Republicans nearly 50 House seats . A third way to effect considerable change in Congress is what might be called “ unequal gains , ” where both parties add votes from the previous midterm but one party gains far more than the other . That happened in 1982 , President Reagan ’s first midterm , when the Republican congressional vote grew by more than 3 million from 1978 , but the Democratic tally swelled by more than 6 million . The result : a gain of roughly two dozen House seats for the Democrats .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3472.png","An Overview of House Election Results Since 1980","A one - party surge in the Democratic vote in 2006 or a one - party collapse in the Republican vote is unlikely , given the GOP ’s recent success at voter mobilization . More likely is an increased vote for both parties , with the Republicans hoping to keep the nationwide House tally as close to 50 - 50 as possible . That is what happened from 1996 through 2000 , as the nationwide congressional vote between the two parties was virtually even each time and the GOP retained control of the House . The GOP ’s ultimate ace in the hole is that they approach Nov. 7 as the reigning champions of voter turnout . In 2002 , the Republican House vote increased by more than 5 million from 1998 , compared with a Democratic gain of barely 2 million . In 2004 , President Bush gained more than 11 million votes from 2000 , compared with an increase for Democrat John Kerry of barely 8 million over Al Gore ’s tally four years earlier .","A 52 % majority of the public thinks a health care reform bill will pass over the next year ; 37 % say that they do not expect a bill to pass and 11 % are n’t sure .

That percentage had fallen sharply by the late 1990s and has remained low over the last decade .","How does the public perceive news media performance?","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3500.png","Bush Approval among Evangelicals White Evange lical","President Bush ’s job approval rating has fallen , and his personal favorability is down significantly as well , leading many Republicans to worry about the impact a weakened president will have on his party ’s showing in the fall mid - term elections . Even among one of the president ’s most supportive constituencies , white evangelical Protestants , Mr. Bush has suffered declines . Given the importance of evangelicals for the electoral successes of the Republican Party over the past several years , how serious is Bush ’s slump among this key voter group for the party ’s prospects this fall ? A new analysis by the Pew Research Center finds that while the president still has the support of a majority of white evangelical Protestants , significantly fewer of them now approve of his performance in office ( 55 % approve , 38 % disapprove ) than was true at the start of his second term when 72 % approved and only 22 % disapproved . Indeed , since he began his second term in office , Bush ’s approval rating has declined as much among white evangelicals as among the public as a whole . In addition , his personal ratings among evangelicals are also now more negative than ever before – 35 % now have an unfavorable view of Bush , compared with 21 % of registered evangelical voters in October 2004 . Moreover , 45 % of evangelicals agreed with the statement that “ I am tired of all the problems associated with the Bush administration ” – less than a majority but a sizable number nonetheless .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3496.png","Party Identifica tion by Age","In partisan terms , there is dramatic evidence for a generational divide . Young people today are much more likely to identify or lean Democratic rather than Republican , especially compared with the GenXers and late Baby Boomers who are in their 30s and 40s today . For example , among 18 - 24 year olds in Pew surveys over the past year and a half , fully 51 % say they are Democrats or lean to the Democratic Party ; just 37 % are Republicans or lean to the GOP . By contrast , Republicans match the Democrats among those 40 - 44 years old ( 43 % Republican , 45 % Democrat ) – those Americans who came of age during the Reagan years . In fact , the partisan leanings of DotNets today mirror their parents ’ generation – many of whom are in the first half of the Baby Boomer cohort . Among Baby Boomers who came of age during the late 1960s and early 1970s – those roughly ages 50 - 59 now – party identification is nearly the same as among the DotNets : 51 % Democratic or leaning , 38 % Republican .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3501.png","Percent of Ame ricans Who Are the White Protestants","The rising political clout of evangelical Christians is not the result of growth in their numbers but rather of their increasing cohesiveness as a key element of the Republican Party . The proportion of the population composed of white evangelicals has changed very little ( 19 % in 1987 ; 22 % now ) and what growth there was occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s . However , in 1987 , white evangelical Protestants were closely divided in their partisan attachments , with 34 % identifying as Republicans and 29 % as Democrats . The shift toward Republican identification among white evangelicals came in two stages . In the late 1980s , white evangelicals in the South were still mostly wedded to the Democratic Party while evangelicals outside the South were more aligned with the GOP . But over the course of the next decade or so , the GOP made gains among white Southerners generally – and evangelicals in particular – nearly eliminating this regional disparity . Since the election of George W. Bush in 2000 , Republican identification has grown among both Southern and non - Southern evangelicals . Today , Republicans outnumber Democrats among white evangelicals by more than two - to - one ( 51%-22 % ) , and hold a 63%-29 % lead when partisan “ leaners ” are included . Although Republican Party identification among both evangelicals and non - evangelicals increased slightly following the September 11 attacks , it has since retreated to pre-9/11 levels for non - evangelicals . Among evangelicals , it has continued to rise . Today , white evangelicals make up 22 % of the population , and constitute nearly four out of every ten ( 39 % ) Republicans .","After the debate over health care reform , news about swine flu and the economy vied for public attention , with other stories registering less widely . Reports about swine flu and the availability of a vaccine were followed very closely by a somewhat smaller percentage of the public ( 30 % ) . However , just as many call swine flu their top story of the week ( 16 % ) as cited the economy ( 15 % ) . In general , swine flu interest outpaced coverage : just 2 % of the newshole was devoted to the story last week .","During the years of the Bush presidency , America ’s image never grew quite as negative in Canada as it did in much of Western Europe , but it nonetheless declined substantially .

Specifically , average family income of unauthorized migrant families is more than 40 % below the average income of either legal immigrant or native families . In addition to education and occupation differences , another factor contributing to this difference is the lower labor force participation of unauthorized females that results in fewer workers per family than in the other groups .

The relatively low incomes of unauthorized migrants in the country for more than 10 years most likely reflects a lack of opportunities for economic mobility among those who remain in an unauthorized status . Many unauthorized migrants are able to become legal immigrants after 10 or more years in the U.S. Those who are left as unauthorized may not be able to take advantage of a range of jobs available ; that is , they may be “ stuck ” in lower - paying jobs .","mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3546.png","Income per Person Suffers Average Family Income per Person, 2003","The data clearly show that incomes are higher for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for more than 10 years , compared with more recently arrived immigrants .

English is far and away the dominant language of U.S. commerce and trade , and dominates U.S. workplaces . English / Spanish bilingual Latinos report that they largely speak English in the workplace . About 60 % of bilingual Hispanic workers usually speak more English than Spanish at work ( 29 % ) , or use only English at work ( 33 % ) . Widespread Spanish language usage at work is relatively rare among bilingual workers . About one in ten report speaking “ more Spanish than English ” or “ only Spanish ” at work ( see Figure 3 ) . English / Spanish bilingual Hispanics seem to be markedly different from the wider Hispanic adult population in their mass media preferences . The survey asked respondents whether they typically received news ( via TV or radio ) in English or Spanish . Almost 40 % of all Latino adults said either “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English , ” reflecting the usage patterns of Latino adults with little speaking ability in English . Bilingual Latinos extensively use English to obtain news broadcasts , as Figure 3 illustrates . Nearly five in ten bilingual Hispanics hear news in “ English only ” or “ more English than Spanish . ” Less than a fifth reported obtaining news in “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English . ” So the preponderance of bilingual speaking Latinos either obtains news in English , or does not express an exclusive preference for hearing news in Spanish . At home English / Spanish speaking Latinos are about evenly divided in their use of Spanish and English ( see Figure 3 ) .
