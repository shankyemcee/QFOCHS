The public started the decade and the recession in no mood for government regulation . In a September 1981 Gallup survey , fully 59 % said they opposed greater government intervention into business , siding with the argument that regulation impairs the workings of the free market system . Just 24 % favored greater government intervention to protect individuals from economic abuses . A 1981 CBS / New York Times poll found that two - thirds of Americans completely or mostly agreed that the government had gone too far in regulating business and interfering with the free enterprise system . This may have been the result of a lack of trust in the government . In 1982 , an American National Election Studies survey found 62 % said they trusted the government in Washington only sometimes and an additional 2 % said they never did . Only about a third said they trusted the feds most of the time ( 31 % ) or just about always ( 2 % ) .
