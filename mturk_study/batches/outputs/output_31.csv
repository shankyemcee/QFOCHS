In addition to interest in the possible Koran burning ( 33 % very closely ) , the public also very closely tracked news about developments in Afghanistan ( 30 % ) and Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations ( 33 % ) . Nearly as many ( 9 % ) say they followed news about the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks most closely . News about commemorations made up 2 % of coverage .

At the same time , the proportion of Americans who get news from traditional media platforms – television , radio and print – has been stable or edging downward in the last few years . There has been no overall decline in the percentage saying they watched news on television , and even with the continued erosion of print newspaper and radio audiences , three - quarters of Americans got news yesterday from one or more of these three traditional platforms .","We also see party affiliation changing in understandable ways over time , in response to major events and political circumstances .

Bush ’s job performance was rising and opinions about the GOP were becoming increasingly negative","Barack Obama ’s image remains , by comparison , more positive – 50 % offer a favorable assessment of the president , 45 % an unfavorable one . Even so , Obama ’s personal ratings are lower than most presidential candidates in recent elections . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press , conducted July 16 - 26 , 2012 , among 2,508 adults , including 1,956 registered voters , finds that , in keeping with his favorability advantage , Obama continues to hold a sizable lead over Romney in the election contest . Currently , 51 % say they support Obama or lean toward him , while 41 % support or lean toward Romney . This is largely unchanged from earlier in July and consistent with polling over the course of this year . Across eight Pew Research Center surveys since January , Obama has led Romney by between four and 12 percentage points .","Obama holds only a four - point edge ( 48 % to 44 % ) across 12 of this year ’s key battleground states . While the data does not allow a state - by - state analysis , the overall balance of support in these closely contested states has remained level in recent months , with Obama slightly ahead , but neither candidate holding a significant advantage .","As the nation marked the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks last week , many in the public and the media focused more on current tensions over Islam in America – most notably plans by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran . Nearly two - in - ten ( 17 % ) say they followed the controversy over the pastor ’s announcement that he would burn Korans on Sept. 11 more closely than any other major story .

Pew Research Center polling conducted so far in 2012 has found fewer Americans affiliating with one of the major parties than at any point in the past 25 years . And looking at data from Gallup going back to 1939 , it is safe to say that there are more political independents in 2012 than at any point in the last 75 years . Currently , 38 % of Americans identify as independents , while 32 % affiliate with the Democratic Party and 24 % affiliate with the GOP . That is little changed from recent years , but long - term trends show that both parties have lost support . The percentage of Americans identifying as Democrats increased from 31 % in 2002 , following the 9/11 terrorist attacks , to 36 % in 2008 . But over the past four years , Democratic affiliation has fallen to 32 % . Republican identification stood at 30 % in 2002 , but fell to 25 % in 2008 and has not recovered since then .","Americans continued to follow news about the presidential campaign more closely than any other news last week , though they also closely followed news about the price of gasoline . Nearly three - in - ten ( 28 % ) say news about the candidates for president was their top story , while 17 % say they followed news about gas prices most closely .","Latinos continue to lag behind non - Latinos in cell phone use . Just over three - fourths ( 76 % ) of Latinos ages 18 and older use cell phones ; this number is 86 % among non - Latinos.9 The same is true with regard to internet use , despite marked gains by Latinos in recent years ( Livingston , Parker and Fox 2009 ) . Some 64 % of Latinos use the internet , compared with 78 % of non - Latinos — a 14 percentage point difference .","Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle continue to receive negative assessments from the public . Today , just a third ( 33 % ) approves of the Republican congressional leadership ; about the same number ( 35 % ) approves of the Democratic leadership . While these evaluations have changed little in recent months , approval ratings for Democratic leaders are now far lower than they were in early 2009 . Ratings for Republican leaders have shown less change over this period .","More than half of the public ( 55 % ) say this was the news they followed most closely last week . The Gulf coast spill now has been the most closely followed story for each of the past 12 weeks . News about the spill again received more coverage than any other major story , accounting for 20 % of the newshole .

As the past 30 years have shown , shifts in the public ’s judgments about presidential performance are not always the product of rising or falling unemployment rates ; other factors can intervene . However , there is nothing now on the horizon that seems likely to diminish the impact that unemployment is having on views of Obama . His situation continues to parallel Reagan ’s , whose ratings recovered only when jobless rates began to decline .","About two - in - ten ( 18 % ) say they followed news about the health care debate most closely , while 11 % say they followed reports about the condition of the economy most closely .

The bureau has just released results for 2010 from the alternative metric — called the Supplemental Poverty Measure ( SPM)—that uses a wider range of factors than the official federal measure to determine poverty status . Compared with the official measure , SPM figures released by the Census Bureau show a higher national poverty rate for 2010 , 16.0 % , compared with the official poverty rate of 15.2 % ( Short , 2011).1 The number of poor people in 2010 was 49.1 million using the alternative measure , compared with 46.6 million using the official measure . Using the SPM also resulted in higher poverty rates for some groups and lower poverty rates for others , when compared with the official measure . Among the nation ’s largest racial and ethnic groups , poverty rates using the alternative measure are higher than official poverty rates for Hispanics , whites2 and Asians , but are lower for blacks . For Hispanics , the SPM poverty rate ( 28.2 % ) was 1.5 percentage points higher than the official poverty rate of 26.7 % . For whites , the SPM poverty rate was 11.1 % while the official poverty rate was 10.0 % . For Asians , the SPM poverty rate was 16.7 % versus the official poverty rate of 12.1 % .
