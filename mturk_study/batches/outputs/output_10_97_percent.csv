Older Americans , however , still take a more negative stance than their younger compatriots on most aspects of the U.S.-China relationship .

Older Americans , those ages 50 and older , are more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have unfavorable views of China . This has been the case every year since the Center first asked the question 15 years ago . But while half or more of those 50 and older have held negative views of China since 2012 , this is the first year in which more than half of younger Americans also have an unfavorable opinion .

A new national survey finds that just 15 % of U.S. adults say they like the way he conducts himself as president . A far larger share ( 53 % ) say they do n’t like how he conducts himself , while another 30 % say they have mixed feelings .","What are the Americans' thoughts on Trump's personality?","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/1908.png","Republicans who have not completed college express more positive views of Trump’s conduct in office","Similarly , while 38 % of conservative Republicans , who make up about two - thirds of all Republicans and GOP leaners , express positive views of Trump ’s conduct , only 20 % of moderate and liberal Republicans do so . And older Republicans , especially those 65 and older , are more likely than younger Republicans to say they like Trump ’s conduct as president .","What's the relationship between Trump's approval and age groups?","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/1910.png","Among Republicans, conservatives express greater issue agreement with Trump than moderates","There is a similar pattern in views of agreement with Trump on issues among Republican subgroups . While majorities of Republicans across demographic and educational categories agree with Trump on many or nearly all ( or all ) issues , half or more of self - described conservatives ( 50 % ) and those 65 and older ( 54 % ) say they agree with Trump on all or nearly all issues .

Two - thirds of adults think other Americans have little or no confidence in the federal government . Majorities believe the public ’s confidence in the U.S. government and in each other is shrinking , and most believe a shortage of trust in government and in other citizens makes it harder to solve some of the nation ’s key problems .

To explore these connections , we asked questions about people ’s general trust or distrust in others , their sense of the exploitative tendencies or fairness of others , and their assessment of the overall helpfulness or selfishness of others . Then , we built a scale of personal trust and distributed people along a spectrum from least trusting to most trusting . About a fifth of adults ( 22 % ) display consistently trustful attitudes on these questions , and roughly a third ( 35 % ) express consistently wary or distrustful views . Some 41 % hold mixed views on core personal trust questions.1 There are some notable demographic variations in levels of personal trust , which , even in these new contexts , follow historic trends captured by the Center and other researchers . The share of whites who show high levels of trust ( 27 % ) is twice as high as the share of blacks ( 13 % ) and Hispanics ( 12 % ) . The older a person is , the more likely they are to tilt toward more trustful answers . The more education Americans have , and the greater their household income , the greater the likelihood they are high on the personal trust spectrum . Those with less income and education are markedly more likely to be low trusters .","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/3141.png","Many Americans have confidence in others to do the right thing in civic life at times, but not always.","However , this level of confidence does not extend across all civic activities .

Americans also are split on whether they can rely on others to reconsider their views after learning new information ( 49 % have at least some confidence , 50 % little or none ) , stay informed about important issues and events ( 49 % vs. 51 % ) and respect the rights of people who are not like them ( 48 % vs. 52 % ) . Moreover , in some areas Americans do not expect others to act in civically helpful ways . Some 58 % of adults are not confident that others can hold civil conversations with people who have different views , and 57 % are not confident others will cast informed votes in elections .","A new national survey finds that just 15 % of U.S. adults say they like the way he conducts himself as president .
