Most of this growth has been driven by U.S.-born Hispanics , whose English proficiency share has grown from 71.9 % in 1980 to 89.7 % in 2015 . By contrast , English proficiency among foreign - born Hispanics has seen little change over the same period .

While a large majority of the well - educated has consistently been online , those without a college degree saw greater rates of adoption over the past 15 years and have notably lowered the access gap . Adults with a college or graduate degree are the most likely to use the internet , with almost all of these adults ( 95 % ) saying they are internet users . This proportion has always been high – fifteen years ago , 78 % of adults with at least a college degree used the internet .

Those living in households with an annual income under $ 30,000 a year are less likely to report internet usage , with 74 % of adults doing so now . These trends have been consistent over time , although the more recent rise of smartphones has provided internet access to lower - income people , sometimes with lower prices , sometimes with other attractive technology features .

Overall , 30 % of adults say a course taken only online provides an equal educational value compared with a course taken in person in a classroom ; 68 % say it does not .
