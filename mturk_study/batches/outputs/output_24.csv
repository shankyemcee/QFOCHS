This aligns with previous Pew Research Center surveys on Americans ’ views of climate change .","Even before any departures resulting from this week ’s meeting , United Methodists have been shrinking considerably as a share of the U.S. population , part of a broader trend among U.S. Christians and particularly mainline Protestants . Our 2014 study found that United Methodists make up 3.6 % of the U.S. adult population – down from 5.1 % in 2007 . ( Mainline Protestants as a whole declined from 18.1 % of the adult population to 14.7 % over that seven - year period . )","Data on the prevalence of anxiety disorders is hard to come by among teens specifically . But 7 % of youths ages 3 to 17 had such a condition in 2016 - 17 , according to the National Survey of Children ’s Health . Serious depression , meanwhile , has been on the rise among teens for the past several years , according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health , an ongoing project of the federal Department of Health and Human Services . In 2016 , 12.8 % of youths ages 12 to 17 had experienced a major depressive episode in the past year , up from 8 % as recently as 2010 . For 9 % of youths in 2016 , their depression caused severe impairment . Fewer than half of youths with major depression said they ’d been treated for it in the past year .","Fewer teens these days are drinking alcohol , according to the University of Michigan ’s long - running Monitoring the Future survey , which tracks attitudes , values and behaviors of American youths , including their use of various legal and illicit substances . Last year , 30.2 % of 12th - graders and 18.6 % of 10th - graders had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days . Two decades earlier , those figures were 52 % and 38.8 % , respectively . ( In the Center ’s new survey , 16 % of teens said they felt “ a lot ” or “ some ” pressure to drink alcohol . ) But the Michigan survey also found that , despite some ups and downs , use of marijuana ( or its derivative , hashish ) among 12th - graders is nearly as high as it was two decades ago . Last year , 22.2 % reported using marijuana in the past 30 days , versus 22.8 % in 1998 . Past - month marijuana use among 10th - graders has declined a bit over that same period , from 18.7 % to 16.7 % , but is up from 14 % in 2016 . Marijuana was by far the most commonly used drug among teens last year , as it has been for decades . While more than 10 % of 12th - graders reported using some illicit drug other than marijuana in the late 1990s and early 2000s , that figure had fallen to 6 % by last year .","What is the trend in number of Christians and Methodists as share of US population?","What is the trend in US youth depression?","What is the current scenario of alcohol and marijuana usage among the youth?"

Depending on the voter file vendor , the percentage of panelists matched varied from a low of 50 % to a high of 79 % , with an average match rate of 69 % . Less than half ( 42 % ) of the panelists were located in all five files , but each of the vendors “ found ” panelists missed by other vendors . Differences among the vendors are largely a function of their tolerance for mismatches and , presumably , the success of their matching algorithms . Collectively , the vendors successfully matched 91 % of panelists , meaning that more than nine - in - ten panelists could be found on at least one of the files and just 9 % of panelists could not be found on any of the files . The relatively high level of coverage of the files is encouraging for researchers and campaigns that use them for targeting , messaging or research . Of course , most clients using these voter files will not have purchased all five of them , so match rates of 90 % and higher may be difficult if not impossible to achieve with any single file . Still , commercial voter files may disproportionately miss segments of the public who are politically disengaged , younger , Hispanic and more mobile . Specifically , the likelihood of finding an individual on a commercial voter file was strongly related to whether they were registered to vote . On average across the five vendors , 77 % of people who said they were registered to vote were matched . Only 38 % of the self - described unregistered voters were matched . Similarly , match rates varied greatly by panelists ’ age , race and ethnicity .

( Those average rates are weighted by product import shares with all of each nation ’s trading partners , and do n’t necessarily reflect the provisions of specific trade deals . Under NAFTA , for instance , most trade between the U.S. , Canada and Mexico is duty - free . ) That generations - long debate can be seen in the oscillations of U.S. tariff levels throughout history . In 1821 , when reliable tariff statistics begin , nearly all imports ( 95.5 % ) were taxed , and duties imposed equaled 43.2 % of the total value of all imports and 45 % of the dutiable value . For the next 100 + years , U.S. trade policy followed a fairly predictable pattern : When Democrats controlled the levers of power , tariff rates were lower ; when Whigs or Republicans regained control , rates were higher . The culmination of this perennial drama – what one contemporary writer called “ an endless performance in which the actors are unskilled and the audience dissatisfied ; and yet the same old play is staged over and over and over again ” – was the infamous Smoot - Hawley Tariff of 1930 , which raised import duties on thousands of agricultural and industrial goods . By 1932 , U.S. tariffs equaled 59.1 % of the value of dutiable imports , the highest level since 1830 . Although duties represented only 19.6 % of the value of all imports ( since by that time around two - thirds of imported goods were duty - free ) , that was still the highest level since before World War I.

Meanwhile , the priority placed on issues such as the environment , crime , illegal immigration and even reducing health care costs has fallen off from a year ago . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press , conducted Jan. 7 - 11 among 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines , finds that strengthening the economy and improving the job situation are higher priorities today than they have been at any point over the past decade , and the recent upward trend has been steep . The share of Americans saying that strengthening the nation ’s economy should be a top priority has risen from 68 % two years ago to 75 % last January to 85 % today . Concern about jobs has risen even more sharply . The 82 % who rate improving the job situation as a top priority represents a 21 - point jump from 61 % a year ago . Of the 20 issues people were asked to rate in both January 2008 and January 2009 , five have slipped significantly in importance as attention to the economy has surged .

The percentage rating illegal immigration as a top priority has fallen from 51 % to 41 % over the past year , and reducing crime has fallen by a similar amount ( from 54 % to 46 % ) .

The top - rated issue among Latinos is the economy ; 57 % of Hispanics say it is an extremely important one for the new president to address . Education , health care , national security and the environment all also rate higher than immigration as a policy priority among Hispanics , while energy policy ranks lower . Latinos , who make up 15 % of the U.S. population , are by far the nation ’s biggest immigrant group . According to Pew Hispanic Center tabulations of the 2006 American Community Survey , more than half ( 55 % ) of Latinos ages 18 and older are immigrants , and 47 % of all immigrants ages 18 and older are Hispanic . Even at the apex of the congressional debate over immigration reform in 2007 , however , the issue never rose to the top of Latinos ’ priority list .

This CPS estimate lines up closely with the 2018 National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) , which estimates that 79 % of U.S. adults would say yes to a very simple question , “ Do you use the internet ? ” Another potential measurement wrinkle comes from the various types of activities people can engage in on the internet .

In 2019 , about four - in - ten black Democratic voters called themselves moderate , while smaller shares described their views as liberal ( 29 % ) or conservative ( 25 % ) .

Of the 35 newspapers for which the Center could determine the number of laid - off newsroom staff , about half ( 49 % ) laid off 10 or fewer employees , according to the analysis . The cuts tended to be larger at eight digital - native news outlets where the number of layoffs could be determined : Only one outlet laid off fewer than 10 employees . ( For more details on how these were counted , see the methodology . ) The prevalence of layoffs at newspapers in the analysis during the 16 - month study period reflects recent employment trends in the newspaper sector , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Between 2014 and 2017 , the number of newspaper newsroom employees dropped by 15 % , from about 46,000 to about 39,000 . There was no significant change in digital - native newsroom employees , however , as the number remained around 11,000 to 13,000 over the same three - year period .

In comparison , Boomer and Silent households ’ financial assets are at a level similar to before the Great Recession . In addition , unlike their older counterparts , Gen Xers are still of prime working age . Higher household income tends to boost wealth because it enables families to save and add to wealth . Gen X ’s ability to rebuild its wealth may reflect its relatively robust household income growth since 2010 . The median adjusted household income of Gen X households increased more than 20 % and , at $ 73,200 in 2016 , surpassed that of other generations . The oldest Gen Xer was 51 as of 2016 , meaning that Gen X workers are still approaching their peak earning years .
