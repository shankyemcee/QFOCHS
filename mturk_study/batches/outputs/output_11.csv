The survey also examined public school prayer from a different angle by asking teens whether they see other students praying before eating lunch . Around one - in - six teens in public schools ( 16 % ) say they often or sometimes see other students doing this . Teens who identify with a religion are more likely than those who self - identify as atheist , agnostic or “ nothing in particular ” to notice this ( 19 % vs. 9 % ) .

Several groups express relatively low levels of trust in law enforcement agencies to use facial recognition responsibly – most notably black adults , younger people and those who identify as Democrats .

Two - thirds of Americans ( 67 % ) support raising the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , including 41 % who say they strongly favor such an increase , according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring . Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents are largely united in backing a $ 15 an hour federal minimum wage : 86 % favor this , including nearly six - in - ten ( 59 % ) who say they strongly support it .

There is no significant gender difference in the amount of time moms and dads who are multigenerational caregivers engage in adult care . Multigenerational caregivers younger than age 30 spend more than three hours a day engaged in this kind of work , compared with just over two hours a day among those ages 45 to 59 .

For Asians , naturalized citizens had a turnout rate of 42.7 % compared with 36.7 % for those born in the U.S. Those figures are up from 29.6 % and 22.4 % in 2014 . Among all U.S. eligible voters , by contrast , the 2018 turnout rate of naturalized citizens trailed that of the U.S. born , 45.7 % to 54.2 % , a similar pattern as in recent elections .","Compare the voter turnout rates of naturalized Asians with those born in the US","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/3505.png","Majorities of the public in six Western European countries say they pay the church tax Currently pay the church tax","Even though most Western Europeans are not very religious , and those who live in countries with a church tax can opt out of paying it , support for the tradition remains strong in the region , according to a new Pew Research Center report , based on a 2017 survey of 15 countries . The study examines public attitudes toward church taxes by comparing the views of Western Europeans who say they pay such taxes with those who have opted out . Six of 15 surveyed Western European countries have a mandatory church tax for members of religious groups . They are Austria , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Sweden and Switzerland . While the rules for administering the tax or fee vary from country to country , each nation generally assesses a portion of the income ( or taxes paid ) of taxpayers who are members of the country ’s larger churches . While most registered Christians – and , in some countries , members of other religious groups – must pay the tax , people have the option of avoiding the tax by deregistering from their church . The money collected usually pays for church expenses , including clergy salaries , maintaining buildings and funding church charities . Sizable majorities of adults in all six countries with a mandatory tax say they pay it . Eight - in - ten Danes and roughly three - quarters of Austrians ( 76 % ) and Swiss ( 74 % ) say they pay the tax . In each country , a small share of adults – ranging from 8 % in Switzerland to 20 % in Finland – say they used to pay the tax but no longer do so .","Describe the rate of European citizens who pay mandatory church taxes.","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4670.png","Some groups have reached near-saturation levels for adoption of basic technologies","The shares of U.S. adults who say they use the internet , use social media , own a smartphone or own a tablet computer are all nearly identical to the shares who said so in 2016 . The share who say they have broadband internet service at home currently stands at 65 % – nearly identical to the 67 % who said this in a survey conducted in summer 2015 . And when it comes to desktop or laptop ownership , there has actually been a small dip in the overall numbers over the last two years – from 78 % in 2016 to 73 % today . A contributing factor behind this slowing growth is that parts of the population have reached near - saturation levels of adoption of some technologies . Put simply , in some instances there just are n’t many non - users left . For example , nine - in - ten or more adults younger than 50 say they go online or own a smartphone . And a similar share of those in higher - income households have laptops or desktops .","mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4672.png","TV is the most popular source for news across Western Europe, but online and radio outlets are just as popular in some countries","Across the countries studied – Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom – a median of 70 % say they get news at least daily from TV .
