In 2018, among workers ages 25 to 34, women’s earnings were 89% those of men, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly wages that includes full- and part-time workers. But evidence suggests that as women enter the responsibilities of parenthood their earnings fall further behind same-aged male counterparts. Several other factors are believed to contribute to the persistence of the gender wage gap, among them the impact of broader family caregiving responsibilities, differences in the industries and occupations in which women and men work, workplace gender discrimination, and differences in workforce experience.",good

Despite the pressures of academic life, soaring college costs and burdensome student loans, young college graduates were better off than their degreeless peers on many measures of economic well-being and career attainment, and to a greater extent than in the past. The Center’s most recent analysis found that the median salary for college graduates ages 25 to 37 working full time earned was about $24,700 more annually than employed young adults holding only a high school diploma.

Teens spend 26 minutes a day, on average, doing paid work during the school year, compared with 49 minutes about a decade ago and 57 minutes in the mid-1990s, according to a recent Pew Research Center analysis of time use data from the BLS. Teens also are working less during the summer. As recently as two decades ago, roughly half of U.S. teens could expect to be working for at least part of their summer vacation. But the share of teens working summer jobs has dwindled since the early 1990s: After bottoming out in 2010 and 2011 at 29.6%, the teen summer employment rate began rising again but was still only 34.6% in summer 2017. (From 1940 through the late 1980s, the teen summer employment rate generally fluctuated between 46% and 58%.) The decline of teens in summer jobs reflects an overall decline in youth employment in recent decades, a trend that’s also been observed in other advanced economies.",good

The biggest gap occurred during 1970-1975, when the group of leading industrial nations was established. At that time, the global fertility rate was 4.47 projected lifetime births per woman, but 2.03 among G7 nations.

Nationwide, the sense that China’s growing military would be beneficial for the U.S. has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. But even while many Americans are concerned about the potential impact of China’s military growth, they are somewhat sanguine about how China’s economic growth affects the United States. Half of Americans think China’s growing economy is a good thing for the U.S. while 41% say it’s a bad thing. When first asked in 2005, similar proportions felt the same (49% good, 40% bad).

In 2009, about half of Democrats (52%) said immigrants “strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents.” Earlier this year, 83% of Democrats said immigrants did more to strengthen than burden the country. A similar shift has occurred on same-sex marriage and views of the state of racial equality. In 2009, Democrats were divided in their views of same-sex marriage; today, three-quarters favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.

At the same time, income inequality continues to grow, and the growth has been more pronounced among some racial and ethnic groups than among others. For example, the gap between Asians at the top and bottom of the income ladder nearly doubled between 1970 and 2016. Over that period, Asians went from being one of the groups with the lowest income inequality to the highest.

The share of links posted by suspected automated accounts to sites within Pew Research Center’s set of 50 news organizations ranged from 32% to 91%. More than half of these media outlets – 33 of 50 – saw a higher proportion of tweeted links from suspected automated accounts than from humans during the study period. When suspected bot accounts link to news on Twitter, posts are more likely to focus on nonpolitical than political content. In addition to looking at the news sites that suspected bot accounts linked to, we examined the text of each tweet to determine whether or not it focused on political content. In general, the higher the share of politics-focused tweets that linked to a particular news site in our analysis, the lower the likelihood that a suspected bot shared the tweet. Suspected bots are more likely to link to political news sites that have an ideologically mixed or centrist audience than to sites that have a very liberal or very conservative audience. In an additional analysis of a broader set of 358 popular news and current-events sites that feature political content in their headlines, researchers found that the ideology of these sites’ audiences was negatively associated with the proportion of tweeted links shared by suspected bots. Automated accounts posted roughly 41% of links to political sites shared primarily by liberals and 44% of links to political sites shared primarily by conservatives – a difference that is not statistically significant. By contrast, suspected bots shared between 57% and 66% of links from news and current-events sites shared primarily by an ideologically mixed or centrist human audience.",complex

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/593.png,"In 2016, according to the World Bank, the average applied U.S. tariff across all products was 1.61%; that was about the same as the average rate of 1.6% for the 28-nation EU, and not much higher than Japan’s 1.35%. Among other major U.S. trading partners, Canada’s average applied tariff rate was 0.85%, China’s was 3.54% and Mexico’s was 4.36%. (Those average rates are weighted by product import shares with all of each nation’s trading partners, and don’t necessarily reflect the provisions of specific trade deals. Under NAFTA, for instance, most trade between the U.S., Canada and Mexico is duty-free.) That generations-long debate can be seen in the oscillations of U.S. tariff levels throughout history. In 1821, when reliable tariff statistics begin, nearly all imports (95.5%) were taxed, and duties imposed equaled 43.2% of the total value of all imports and 45% of the dutiable value. For the next 100+ years, U.S. trade policy followed a fairly predictable pattern: When Democrats controlled the levers of power, tariff rates were lower; when Whigs or Republicans regained control, rates were higher. The culmination of this perennial drama – what one contemporary writer called “an endless performance in which the actors are unskilled and the audience dissatisfied; and yet the same old play is staged over and over and over again” – was the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which raised import duties on thousands of agricultural and industrial goods. By 1932, U.S. tariffs equaled 59.1% of the value of dutiable imports, the highest level since 1830. Although duties represented only 19.6% of the value of all imports (since by that time around two-thirds of imported goods were duty-free), that was still the highest level since before World War I. A 1995 survey of economic historians found broad agreement that Smoot-Hawley exacerbated the Great Depression, though to what extent is still debated.",good

Less than half (42%) of the panelists were located in all five files, but each of the vendors “found” panelists missed by other vendors. Differences among the vendors are largely a function of their tolerance for mismatches and, presumably, the success of their matching algorithms. Collectively, the vendors successfully matched 91% of panelists, meaning that more than nine-in-ten panelists could be found on at least one of the files and just 9% of panelists could not be found on any of the files. The relatively high level of coverage of the files is encouraging for researchers and campaigns that use them for targeting, messaging or research. Of course, most clients using these voter files will not have purchased all five of them, so match rates of 90% and higher may be difficult if not impossible to achieve with any single file. Still, commercial voter files may disproportionately miss segments of the public who are politically disengaged, younger, Hispanic and more mobile. Specifically, the likelihood of finding an individual on a commercial voter file was strongly related to whether they were registered to vote. On average across the five vendors, 77% of people who said they were registered to vote were matched. Only 38% of the self-described unregistered voters were matched.
