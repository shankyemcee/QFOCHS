Besides the measures referred to above on building-renamings, we count laws as “ceremonial” if they award medals, designate special days, authorize commemorative coins or otherwise memorialize historic events.

Looking back over the past 30 years, the 101st Congress (1989-1991) passed the most laws in total (650) and had the lowest percentage of substantive laws (63%). That’s because it, like many Congresses before, passed dozens of laws designating special observances – National Tap Dance Day, National Quarter Horse Week, National Library Card Sign-Up Month and the like.

Multigenerational caregivers younger than age 30 spend more than three hours a day engaged in this kind of work, compared with just over two hours a day among those ages 45 to 59.

Among all social media users, people who changed their views on an issue are much more likely than those who didn’t to say such sites are important when it comes to getting involved with political or social issues important to them (63% vs. 35%) or finding others who share their views about important issues (67% vs. 38%). Just over half whose views changed (56%) say social media is personally important in providing a venue to express their political opinions, compared with a third of social media users who have not changed a view in the past year (33%).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4964.png,"A sharp decrease in the share of mothers with four or more children has played a role in the long-term decline in larger families, according to the Census Bureau data. In 1976, four-in-ten moms in their early 40s had given birth to four or more children. But by 2016, the share had shrunk to just 15%. The three-child family, by contrast, has held relatively constant: In both 1976 and 2016, roughly a quarter of mothers ages 40 to 44 had given birth to three children.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4965.png,"But the educational “gap” in fertility has somewhat narrowed in the past two decades, driven by declining childlessness and a rise in larger families among highly educated moms. The share of mothers ages 40 to 44 with at least a master’s degree and three or more children increased from two decades ago, as the share with just one child declined. According to previous research by the Center, highly educated women are the only group with a declining share of one-child families and a rise in families of three or more.",unquestionable
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4966.png,"In the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory, an overwhelming majority of those who said they had voted for him had “warm” feelings for him. By this spring, more than a year into Trump’s presidency, the feelings of these same Trump voters had changed very little. In March, 82% of those who reported voting for Trump – and whom researchers were able to verify through voting records as having voted in 2016 – said they felt “warmly” toward Trump, with 62% saying they had “very warm” feelings toward him. Their feelings were expressed on a 0-100 “feeling thermometer.” A rating of 51 or higher is “warm,” with 76 or higher indicating “very warm” feelings.",good

By September 2016, a 57% majority of these voters had warmed to him, including 24% who felt very warmly. And shortly after the election, three-quarters of these once cold or neutral voters (74%) felt warmly toward him, including 43% who rated him very warmly. Among the 65% majority of Trump voters who felt warmly toward him in April 2016, there was much less change in opinions about him. Of this group, 90% or more maintained warm feelings toward him in September and November 2016.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4988.png,"There was also a substantial age gap in these views: Just 45% of adults younger than 30 said the quality of congressional candidates in their district’s last several elections was good. By contrast, more than six-in-ten of those in older age groups said this, including about three-quarters of those 65 and older (77%). Younger people also tended to offer more negative evaluations of past candidate pools for other levels of office. (The age gap is partly the result of younger people being less likely to identify as partisans, but a gap remains even when that is taken into account.)",complex
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4976.png,"Six-in-ten religiously unaffiliated Americans – adults who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” – say the questioning of religious teachings is a very important reason for their lack of affiliation. The second-most-common reason is opposition to the positions taken by churches on social and political issues, cited by 49% of respondents (the survey asked about each of the six options separately). Smaller, but still substantial, shares say they dislike religious organizations (41%), don’t believe in God (37%), consider religion irrelevant to them (36%) or dislike religious leaders (34%). Those who identify as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” tend to give different reasons for their lack of affiliation, showing that “nones” are far from a monolithic group. For example, about nine-in-ten self-described atheists (89%) say their lack of belief in God is a very important reason for their religious identity, compared with 37% of agnostics and 21% of those in the “nothing in particular” category. Atheists also are more likely than other “nones” to say religion is simply “irrelevant” to them (63% of atheists vs. 40% of agnostics and 26% of adults with no particular religion).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/4981.png,"Students throughout the United States and Europe face many similar tasks throughout their education, from preparing for exams to writing papers. But there are glaring differences when it comes to foreign language education – or lack thereof – and the result is that far lower shares of American students study a foreign language. Learning a foreign language is a nearly ubiquitous experience for students throughout Europe, driven in part by the fact that most European countries have national-level mandates for formally studying languages in school. No such national standard exists in the U.S., where requirements are mostly set at the school district or state level. Overall, a median of 92% of European students are learning a language in school. Most primary and secondary school students across Europe study at least one foreign language as part of their education, according to Eurostat, the statistics arm of the European Commission. Of the 29 European nations for which data are available, 24 have a foreign language learning rate of at least 80%, with 15 of those reaching 90% or more of students enrolled in language courses. In three of the four countries with the smallest student populations – Luxembourg, Malta and Liechtenstein – 100% of students are reported to be learning a foreign language.",complex

Also, men are more likely than women to favor capital punishment (61% vs. 46%). Solid majorities of white evangelical Protestants (73%) and white mainline Protestants (61%) favor the death penalty, while Catholics (53%) and those without a religious affiliation (48%) are more divided on the issue.

Another 54% express concern that, even if gene editing is appropriate for certain purposes, it will lead to a slippery slope, with some using it in morally unacceptable ways. Far fewer Americans see upsides if gene editing for babies were to become widely available. About one-in-five (18%) consider it very likely that gene editing would pave the way for new medical advances that benefit society, and 16% have a similar degree of confidence that it would help people live longer and better quality lives. Roughly a third or more consider each of these as not too or not at all likely to transpire.",good
