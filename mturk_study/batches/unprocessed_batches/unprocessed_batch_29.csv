The number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. also grew during the last decade, rising from 8.4 million in 2000 to 11.1 million in 2011. However, this population peaked at 12 million in 2007, then fell to 11.1 million in 2009.

And increasing percentages describe him as a strong leader, able to get things done and as someone who stands up for his beliefs. Obama’s political advantage is enhanced by the poor standing of his Republican counterparts.

However, though their overall numbers are still relatively low, older adults have represented one of the fastest-growing segments of the social networking site-using population.37 This growth may be driven by several factors, some of which include the ability to reconnect with people from the past, find supporting communities to deal with a chronic disease, and connect with younger generations. Currently, 88% of American adults age 18 and older have a cell phone, 57% have a laptop, 19% own an e-book reader, and 19% have a tablet computer; about six in ten adults (63%) go online wirelessly with one of those devices.
