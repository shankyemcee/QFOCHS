If an Asian ally such as Japan, South Korea, or the Philippines were to become embroiled in a military conflict with China, most Americans (58%) would back the use of force against Beijing. Nearly two-in-three Republicans (65%) and 62% of independents hold this view. And by a 52%-39% margin, Democrats also favor using force to defend an Asian ally.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/7335.png,"Overall, the American public is closely divided between those expressing favorable and unfavorable views of China. But there are notable differences along partisan lines, with Democrats significantly more likely than Republicans or independents to offer a positive opinion of China. However, despite a 2016 presidential campaign season that featured a fair amount of negative rhetoric about China from then-candidate Trump and other GOP contenders, ratings have actually become more positive among Republicans. A year ago, 27% had a favorable opinion, compared with 39% today. Democrats also express more positive ratings this year (49% favorable vs. 39% in 2016). Views among independents are essentially unchanged (41% favorable vs. 40% last year).",good

Still, the share of the public that believes China is primarily a military threat has risen somewhat over time. In 2012, 28% were more concerned about China’s military strength, while 36% now hold this view. Although economic concerns about China have become less prevalent in recent years, many Americans are still worried about China’s economic strength. The amount of American debt held by China, for instance, is the top concern among the eight sources of tension between the two countries included in the survey.",good

A third say they put off paying bills and about a quarter say they borrowed money from family or friends (24%) or received money they weren’t expected to pay back (23%).

Additionally, 49% of internet users know that Americans are legally entitled to get one free copy of their credit report annually from each of the three major credit bureaus. This issue is not specifically related to any technical aspects of cybersecurity, but cybersecurity experts recommend that anyone who uses the internet for financial or other sensitive transactions regularly check their credit reports to discover evidence of identity theft or other kinds of fraud.

The survey found that Republicans more than Democrats favored expanding fossil fuel energy sources, as has been the case in past Pew Research Center surveys. The 2016 survey found that the vast majority of Democrats with high science knowledge opposed expanding offshore oil drilling, fracking and coal mining. Democrats with low science knowledge were more closely divided over these issues.

By contrast, the divorce rate is 13 people per 1,000 married persons for adults ages 50 and older who had been married for 20 to 29 years.

In addition, frequently angry and frustrated officers are roughly twice as likely as those who are not frequently angry or frustrated to agree that police have reason to be distrustful of most citizens (46% vs. 21%).

But at the same time, the backlog of unprocessed asylum applications has reached more than 1 million and continues to grow, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the United Nations and European Union. In 2016, people have continued to cross the eastern Mediterranean into Europe, but in much smaller numbers. However, migration could again surge if an agreement between the EU and Turkey collapses following a coup attempt in Turkey. Migration from Turkey into Greece – the transit corridor used by most of 2015’s 1.3 million migrants – largely stopped once the EU-Turkey deal was put in place in March 2016. This summer, an average of about a hundred migrants has landed on Greece’s shores daily, down from the thousands who arrived every day last summer, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).",good
