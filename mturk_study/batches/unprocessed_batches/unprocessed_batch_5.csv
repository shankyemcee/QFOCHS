mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/43.png,"Only around a quarter of U.S. Hispanics (23%) have heard of the term “Latinx,” and just 3% say they use it to describe themselves. The gender-neutral, pan-ethnic term, which is used to describe the nation’s Hispanic population, has gained traction in recent years among some corporations, local governments, universities and news and entertainment outlets. But relatively few Hispanics are aware of the term and only a small fraction use it to describe themselves. Among Hispanics aware of the term, 65% say “Latinx” should not be used to describe the nation’s Hispanic or Latino population, while 33% say it should.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/46.png,"Amid calls to “defund the police,” only a quarter of Americans said in June that they favor a reduction in spending on policing in their area. The largest share of Americans (42%) preferred spending on policing in their area to stay about the same, while 31% said spending on police should be increased. Support for police spending cuts was higher – but still short of a majority – among adults under 30, Black adults and those who identify as Democratic or lean to the Democratic Party.",good

A majority of Americans (69%) say that divisions between Republicans and Democrats today are increasing, while just 8% say they are decreasing and 23% say they are staying the same.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/117.png,"While Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say partisan divisions are increasing, Democrats are more likely to be very concerned about partisan divides in the country. Sizable majorities in both parties (80% of Republicans, 83% of Democrats) say they are very or somewhat concerned about divisions between Republicans and Democrats. While 40% of Republicans are very concerned by this, a somewhat larger share of Democrats (48%) say the same.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/146.png,"When it comes to the current rivalry between the U.S. and China, Germans and Americans are in slight disagreement on whether a conflict akin to the Cold War will occur. A majority of Americans (59%) think the U.S.-China rivalry will escalate into something like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that dominated geopolitics from the end of World War II until the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s. Around four-in-ten Americans say this is unlikely. Germans are almost equally divided on this hypothetical scenario. About half (49%) say a Cold War-like confrontation is likely, while 47% say it is unlikely.",good

mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/235.png,"U.S. adults believe that partisans cannot agree on basic facts, according to the same survey. The vast majority of Americans (85%) say that Trump and Biden supporters cannot agree on basic facts about important issues facing the country – similar to findings about Republican and Democratic voters in 2018. And eight-in-ten say they think Americans tend to get different facts depending on which news sources they turn to. On both measures, Trump and Biden supporters largely agree. About nine-in-ten in each group say they disagree on basic facts (89% of Trump voters say this, as do 91% of Biden voters). And more than eight-in-ten in each group say that Americans often get different facts depending on which news sources they turn to (89% of Trump voters say this, as do 84% of Biden voters).",good
mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/290.png,"Even at some schools where students are back on campus, online learning is much more prevalent this year than in previous years. And for many schools, almost all classes are being held virtually. Americans are skeptical that this type of learning provides the same value as in-person instruction. Overall, 30% of adults say a course taken only online provides an equal educational value compared with a course taken in person in a classroom; 68% say it does not. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats express this view, although Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say online classes provide an equal value (33% vs. 26%). College graduates are among the most likely to say that online classes do not measure up to in-person ones. Among those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, 75% say online classes do not provide an equal educational value. This compares with 67% among those with some college education and 64% for those with a high school diploma or less.",good
mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/411.png,"Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to express support for journalists’ use of anonymous sources, though majorities of both parties think they are acceptable, at least in moderation. Roughly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (92%) say that it is acceptable for journalists to use anonymous sources, as do about seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (71%). But like Americans overall, most in each party say anonymous sources should be used only in special cases. While fewer in each party say it is always acceptable to rely on anonymous sources, Democrats are about three times as likely as Republicans to say this (22% vs. 8%). The relationship is nearly the inverse for the feeling that anonymous sources should be forbidden. Nearly three-in-ten Republicans (29%) think that it is never acceptable to use anonymous sources – 21 percentage points higher than Democrats who say the same (8%).",good

Around half of registered voters (51%) give Pence “cold” ratings, while slightly more than a third (36%) give him “warm” ratings and 12% have neutral feelings. For Harris, 48% express cold feelings, 39% have warm feelings and 13% give her neutral ratings, according to the Sept. 30-Oct. 5 survey of 11,929 adults, including 10,543 registered voters. The results are based on a “feeling thermometer” in which 100 represents the warmest, most positive score and 0 represents the coldest, most negative rating. Ratings above 50 are considered warm, ratings below 50 are considered cold and ratings of 50 are neutral.",good

Across the 14 nations surveyed, a median of 61% say China has done a bad job dealing with the outbreak. This is many more than say the same of the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by their own country or by international organizations like the World Health Organization or the European Union. Only the U.S. receives more negative evaluations from the surveyed publics, with a median of 84% saying the U.S. has handled the coronavirus outbreak poorly.",good

Awareness and use vary across subgroups, with young Hispanics ages 18 to 29 among the most likely to have heard of the term – 42% say they have heard of it, compared with 7% of those ages 65 or older.

mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/751.png,"Many Christian traditions disapprove of premarital sex. And even though Christians in the United States hold less permissive views than religiously unaffiliated Americans about dating and sex, most say it’s acceptable in at least some circumstances for consenting adults to have sex outside of marriage, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Half of Christians say casual sex – defined in the survey as sex between consenting adults who are not in a committed romantic relationship – is sometimes or always acceptable. Six-in-ten Catholics (62%) take this view, as do 56% of Protestants in the historically Black tradition, 54% of mainline Protestants and 36% of evangelical Protestants. Among those who are religiously unaffiliated, meanwhile, the vast majority (84%) say casual sex is sometimes or always acceptable, including roughly nine-in-ten atheists (94%) and agnostics (95%) who say this. The religiously unaffiliated, also known as “nones,” are those who describe themselves, religiously, as atheist, agnostic or as “nothing in particular.” When it comes to sex between unmarried adults who are in a committed relationship, the gap between Christians and the unaffiliated is less stark. A majority of Christians (57%) say sex between unmarried adults in a committed relationship is sometimes or always acceptable. That includes 67% of mainline Protestants, 64% of Catholics, 57% of Protestants in the historically Black tradition and 46% of evangelical Protestants.",complex
