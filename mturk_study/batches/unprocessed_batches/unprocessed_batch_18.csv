Broad majorities – across party lines – continue to support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants. And large majorities also say this legislation must include increased border security. But the public is divided on an issue that has been among the most contentious in Congress – whether border security must be achieved before the process of legalization can go forward. The national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY, conducted June 12-16 among 1,512 adults, finds that 43% say that people in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to seek legal status only after effective border control is established, while 49% say this can occur while border security improvements are being made.",good

Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified, by a 52%-33% margin. The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation. First, Pew Research referred to the decision to subpoena phone records while the WP/ABC survey said the records were obtained… through a court order, which may make the actions seem more legitimate by highlighting a court’s involvement. Second, what Pew Research described as classified information the WP/ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism. Third, Pew Research mentioned the Justice Department, while WP/ABC mentioned federal prosecutors.

By two-to-one (60% vs. 31%) more said this action by the government went too far rather than was probably justified. An additional factor that likely affected the responses to the Fox News question was the context in which it was presented. Immediately prior to asking about the legitimacy of the DOJ’s actions, Fox News asked: Does it feel like the federal government has gotten out of control and is threatening the basic civil liberties of Americans, or doesn’t it feel this way to you?
