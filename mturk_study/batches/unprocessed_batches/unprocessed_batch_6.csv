Across the nations polled, a median of 52% are dissatisfied with how their democracy is working, while 44% are satisfied. Greeks, Bulgarians and Nigerians register the highest levels of dissatisfaction. In general, people with lower incomes and those who do not support the ruling party are more likely to be dissatisfied with the functioning of democracy. Further, in many European countries, supporters of right-wing populist political parties are especially likely to hold this view. Supporters of Poland’s Law and Justice Party and Hungary’s Fidesz Party – two governing populist parties – show the opposite pattern. One way in which people are unhappy with the way democracy works is that they see political elites as out of touch. Across the nations surveyed, a median of 64% disagree with the statement “Most elected officials care what people like me think.” This opinion is particularly widespread in Europe – a median of 69% express this view. Further, 71% share this view in the U.S. In contrast, fewer say this in the three Asian emerging economies included in the study: India (31%), the Philippines (29%) and Indonesia (18%).

President Donald Trump said his legislation, when proposed, would prioritize family-based green cards to immediate family members. Today, family-based immigration – referred to by some as “chain migration” – is the most common way people gain green cards, in recent years accounting for about two-thirds of the more than 1 million people who receive them annually. This share could decline to about one-third under the president’s proposal. In fiscal 2017, 137,855 employment-based green cards were awarded to foreign workers and their families.

mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/6230.png,"Overall, a global median of 46% say they are satisfied with the way democracy is working in their country, while 52% are not. Satisfaction is most common in Asia-Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa, and least common in Latin America. In Europe, opinions vary widely across nations. More than seven-in-ten are happy with their democracy in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. But two-thirds or more are unhappy in Italy, Spain and Greece – all southern European nations that have struggled economically over the past decade.",good

Stories that cited a member of the public also are less common than those that cite an expert or an interest group.",good

While large majorities of both less-educated and more-educated Filipinos approve of Duterte’s handling of the illegal-drugs issue, these two groups differ on their views of the government’s overall progress in its fight against drugs. Filipinos with a secondary education or above (70%) are much more likely than those with a below-secondary education (49%) to say that the government is making progress in its campaign against illegal drugs.",good

In the event that a serious military conflict did occur between the Philippines and China, 68% believe the U.S. would use military force to defend their country. Even among those who hold the U.S. in an unfavorable light, a majority (58%) believe that the U.S. would use military force to defend the Philippines. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans (58%) say that the U.S. should use military force to defend their Asian allies against China in the event of a serious conflict.",good

Democrats and Democratic leaners were more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to say this (73% vs. 62%) in the 2016 survey, though Republican views on how colleges and universities affect the country have changed dramatically over the past two years.",good

mturk_charts/no_data/two_col/6667.png,"One million immigrants receive lawful permanent resident status each year – also known as a green card – that puts them on a path to citizenship, and most are sponsored by family members. Among the 1,051,031 people granted green cards in fiscal 2015, 65% were relatives of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. Most of these relatives are spouses (25% of new lawful permanent residents), parents (13%) and minor children (6.3%) of U.S. citizens ages 21 and older; they are admitted without quotas. Other family admission visas – for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens, and spouses and children of lawful permanent residents – are subject to category and country limits. About 144,000 green cards in fiscal 2015 went to people on employment visas and their family members. About 152,000 went to refugees and people granted asylum. Nearly 48,000 went to immigrants admitted under a “diversity” program to provide additional visas to nations with low U.S. immigration. From fiscal 2004 to 2015, 57% of people who got green cards already lived in the U.S. on temporary visas: There were a total of 5.5 million new arrivals, compared with a total of 7.4 million already living in the U.S. who adjusted their immigration status.",good

Two close neighbors of North Korea, Japan and South Korea, are also U.S. treaty allies, meaning that if North Korea used military force against them, the U.S. would be obligated to defend them. In both countries, large majorities expect this would happen: 91% of South Koreans expect U.S. assistance in the event of a military conflict with North Korea, and 82% of Japanese say the same. Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) say the U.S. should use military force to defend its allies in Asia in the event that they get into a serious military conflict with North Korea.",good
