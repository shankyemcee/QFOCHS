mturk_charts/two_col/39.png,"Data from the past 50 years reveal the upward yet uneven trajectory of black political leadership in America. In 1965, there were no blacks in the U.S. Senate, nor were there any black governors. And only six members of the House of Representatives were black. As of 2019, there is greater representation in some areas – 52 House members are black, putting the share of black House members (12%) on par with the share of blacks in the U.S. population overall for the first time in history. But in other areas, there has been little change (there are three black senators and no black governors). The current 116th Congress includes 52 black representatives, a record high and a large increase since 1965. (Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat and the first Dominican American elected to Congress, self-identifies as a Latino of African descent. The “Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,” on which this analysis is based, does not count Espaillat among the black members of Congress.) Only one of these 52 representatives – Will Hurd of Texas – is a Republican. Two nonvoting delegates, representing the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are black. Only six representatives were black in 1965, and all were Democrats.",good

But there was only one black Cabinet secretary during Obama’s first term, and the same is true so far in Donald Trump’s administration. The highest level of black representation in a presidential Cabinet occurred during Bill Clinton’s first term, when four out of 15 Cabinet appointees were black. Throughout the rest of Clinton’s administration and George W. Bush’s two terms, the share remained high relative to the share of blacks in the U.S. population overall. When Obama took office, he appointed only one Cabinet member who was black – Attorney General Eric Holder. During Obama’s second term, there were four black Cabinet appointees. The only black Cabinet member to have been appointed by Trump so far in his presidency is Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development.",good

mturk_charts/multi_col/1.png,"Before the coronavirus outbreak sent the U.S. economy into a recession, the share of American children living in poverty was on a downward trajectory, reaching record lows across racial and ethnic groups, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2019, the year with the most recently available data, 14% of children under age 18, or 10.5 million children, were living in poverty, down from 22%, or 16.3 million, in 2010. All major racial and ethnic groups saw declines since 2010, but the greatest decreases were in the shares of Black and Hispanic children living in poverty. About two-in-ten Hispanic children (21%) were living in poverty in 2019, down from 35% in 2010. In 2019, 26% of Black children were impoverished, dropping from 39% in 2010. Even so, Black and Hispanic children were still about three times as likely as Asian (7%) and White (8%) children to be living in poverty.",good

In particular, the numbers of poor Black and White children reached new lows in 2019 (each around 3 million). While there are about as many White children as Black children living in poverty, it’s worth noting that there are more than three times as many White children as Black children in the U.S. The greatest decline was in the number of Hispanic children living in poverty. In 2019, 3.9 million Hispanic children were living in poverty, down from 6.1 million impoverished Hispanic children nearly a decade earlier. But there are still more Hispanic children in poverty than any other racial or ethnic group, which has been the case since at least 2007. This is probably because Hispanics are the largest and the youngest racial or ethnic minority population in the U.S. and because the Hispanic child poverty rate is relatively high (21%).",good
mturk_charts/multi_col/3.png,"The 55.7% VAP turnout in 2016 puts the U.S. behind most of its peers in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, most of whose members are highly developed democratic states. Looking at the most recent nationwide election in each OECD nation, the U.S. places 30th out of 35 nations for which data is available. The highest turnout rates among OECD nations were in Turkey (89% of voting-age population), Sweden (82.1%), Australia (80.8%), Belgium (77.9%) and South Korea (77.9%). Switzerland consistently has the lowest turnout in the OECD: In 2019 federal elections, barely 36% of the Swiss voting-age population voted. As a consequence, turnout comparisons based only on registered voters may not be very meaningful. For instance, U.S. turnout in 2016 was 86.8% of registered voters, fifth-highest among OECD countries and second-highest among those without compulsory voting. But registered voters in the U.S. are much more of a self-selected group, already more likely to vote because they took the trouble to register themselves.",complex
