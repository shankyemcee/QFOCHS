mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/2652.png,"The sharp downward trend in net migration from Mexico began about five years ago and has led to the first significant decrease in at least two decades in the unauthorized Mexican population . As of 2011 , some 6.1 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants were living in the U.S. , down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007 , according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Over the same period , the population of authorized immigrants from Mexico rose modestly , from 5.6 million in 2007 to 5.8 million in 2011 . The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years . During the five - year period from 2005 to 2010 , a total of 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States , down by more than half from the 3 million who had done so in the five - year period of 1995 to 2000 . Meantime , the number of Mexicans and their children who moved from the U.S. to Mexico between 2005 and 2010 rose to 1.4 million , roughly double the number who had done so in the five - year period a decade before . While it is not possible to say so with certainty , the trend lines within this latest five - year period suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two .",same,"What is the difference in the immigration rate of Mexicans to the United States between the periods 1995 to 2000 and 2005 to 2010?",answer1,"The net standstill in Mexican - U.S. migration flows is the result of two opposite trend lines that have converged in recent years .
