Fully 45 % of Americans paid very close attention to the tragedy and 56 % said it was the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week . However , interest in the Virginia Tech shootings was considerably lower than interest in the Columbine High School shootings which occurred almost exactly eight years earlier . More than two - thirds of Americans ( 68 % ) paid very close attention to the Columbine incident . Interest in the Virginia Tech shootings was on a par with school shootings that took place in the fall of 2006 ( including the shooting at an Amish school house in Pennsylvania ) , as well as the 1998 shootings at a middle school in Jonesboro , Arkansas and a high school in Springfield Oregon . In a busy news week , the public ’s focus was primarily on the events in Blacksburg , Virginia . While interest in the situation in Iraq was substantial , the war did not dominate the public ’s attention this past week as it has throughout most of the year . Only 13 % said they followed the events in Iraq more closely than any other news story . Neither Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’s testimony before Congress concerning the firing of eight U.S. attorneys nor the Supreme Court ’s abortion ruling put a dent in the Virginia Tech audience . Only 4 % of the public named either of these stories as the one they followed most closely last week . The Virginia Tech shootings attracted more public interest and received more news coverage than any other story this year . Fully 51 % of all news coverage for the week was devoted to the Virginia Tech shootings and its aftermath . Cable news led the way devoting 76 % of its coverage to the story . More than 60 % of network television news focused on this story , as did half of all radio news . The public relied mainly on television for news about the shootings : 36 % say their main source of information about the story was cable news and another 32 % say they relied primarily on network TV news .

The Supreme Court ’s decision to uphold the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was followed very closely by 21 % of the public . Though the ruling may have been overshadowed in part by the events at Virginia Tech , public interest was not far below that of other abortion rulings by the Court over the past 10 - 20 years .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3437.png,"The Republican Party has traditionally garnered it strongest backing among wealthier voters . But the recent overall decline in Republican Party affiliation nationwide has taken a toll even on GOP support among affluent voters . The latest Pew surveys find Democrats pulling even with Republicans among registered voters with annual family incomes in excess of roughly $ 135,000 per annum . Overall , while remarkably high voter enthusiasm is undoubtedly the key factor in the Democratic Party ’s fundraising success in 2006 and thus far this year , the pool of potential campaign donors is also less tilted toward the GOP today than it has been in the past . Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past 13 years reveals a stark change in the party identification among the wealthiest voters – defined here as those in the top 10 % of household incomes . In 1995 , the year after the Republicans took control of the House and Senate , there were nearly twice as many Republicans ( 46 % ) as Democrats ( 25 % ) among the most affluent 10 % of registered voters ( household incomes of approximately $ 84,000 or more at the time ) . By comparison , there are just as many Democrats ( 31 % ) as Republicans ( 32 % ) among this class of voters today ( household incomes of approximately $ 135,000 or more ) . As has been the case nationwide , the shifting balance has had more to do with Republican losses than Democratic gains . Within the past two years , Republican Party identification has fallen nine percentage points among the wealthiest voters ( from 41 % to 32 % ) , while Democratic identification is up just three points .

While the news media focused on how Gonzales and the White House were connected to the U.S. attorney firings , the public remained intensely focused on the Iraq War . Fully 34 % said they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 23 % listed Iraq as the story they followed most closely last week . Nearly as many ( 31 % ) followed news about conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and more general stories about problems with medical care for wounded soldiers returning from Iraq . Some 17 % said this was the story they followed most closely . Coverage of this story fell off somewhat from the previous week — 4 % of coverage in all media sectors was devoted to this story last week vs. 6 % the week of March 5 . In other top stories this week , the steady stream of news about the 2008 presidential campaign continued . Nine percent of news coverage in all sectors was devoted to this topic . For the past two months , media coverage of the campaign has focused largely on the two leading Democratic candidates , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama . That fact has not been lost on the public , as these two campaigns are at the forefront of the public ’s mind . When asked to name the candidate they ’ve heard the most about in the news lately , 37 % named Clinton and another 24 % named Barack Obama . Mentions of all other candidates were in single digits : 3 % or fewer named John McCain , Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney and John Edwards . Recent news about the stock market attracted a modest audience – 18 % of the public followed this story very closely while 8 % said it was the story they followed most closely . Two weeks earlier , when stocks took a dramatic tumble , the public was following the market somewhat more closely . Stock market happenings drew in a distinct audience – Republicans and men were among the most likely to pay close attention to this story . In addition , the income gap on this story is substantial . Fully 57 % of those with annual household incomes of $ 75,000 or higher followed news about the stock market very or fairly closely .

Fully 61 % believe the Smith story has been overcovered , far more than the number saying that about any other recent story . Even so , a sizable minority ( 11 % ) followed Smith ’s death more closely than any of last week ’s other top stories . This is on par with the number who cited news about the 2008 presidential candidates ( 13 % ) or the Super Bowl ( 11 % ) as the stories they followed most closely . The war in Iraq was the top story for the week of Feb. 5 , with 30 % following it most closely . Data collected since the start of the year suggest that the public and the press are often in agreement about the most important news stories of the day . The Iraq war has consistently been the top - ranked news story both in terms of public interest and press coverage .

The death of Anna Nicole Smith , which set off a classic media feeding frenzy , may be an instance where press coverage exceeded public demand . Eleven percent of the public said Smith ’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week ; 9 % of the week ’s news coverage was devoted to this topic . But because the death occurred mid - week , the full extent of news coverage is not accurately captured by that 9 % figure . In the two days immediately following Smith ’s death ( Feb. 8 - 9 ) , nearly a quarter of the news from all sectors ( 24 % ) was devoted to this story , and fully half of cable news was focused on Smith .
