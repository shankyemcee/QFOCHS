Specifically , average family income of unauthorized migrant families is more than 40 % below the average income of either legal immigrant or native families . In addition to education and occupation differences , another factor contributing to this difference is the lower labor force participation of unauthorized females that results in fewer workers per family than in the other groups . A key element of income is the amount available per person in the family . Because unauthorized families tend to be larger with lower incomes than natives , the difference in average income per person5 is even larger than the difference in income .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3581.png,"Although adult English / Spanish bilingual Latinos have some proficiency in speaking both English and Spanish , they tend to use the languages differently depending on the setting . English is far and away the dominant language of U.S. commerce and trade , and dominates U.S. workplaces . English / Spanish bilingual Latinos report that they largely speak English in the workplace . About 60 % of bilingual Hispanic workers usually speak more English than Spanish at work ( 29 % ) , or use only English at work ( 33 % ) . Widespread Spanish language usage at work is relatively rare among bilingual workers . About one in ten report speaking “ more Spanish than English ” or “ only Spanish ” at work ( see Figure 3 ) . English / Spanish bilingual Hispanics seem to be markedly different from the wider Hispanic adult population in their mass media preferences . The survey asked respondents whether they typically received news ( via TV or radio ) in English or Spanish . Almost 40 % of all Latino adults said either “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English , ” reflecting the usage patterns of Latino adults with little speaking ability in English . Bilingual Latinos extensively use English to obtain news broadcasts , as Figure 3 illustrates . Nearly five in ten bilingual Hispanics hear news in “ English only ” or “ more English than Spanish . ” Less than a fifth reported obtaining news in “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English . ” So the preponderance of bilingual speaking Latinos either obtains news in English , or does not express an exclusive preference for hearing news in Spanish . At home English / Spanish speaking Latinos are about evenly divided in their use of Spanish and English ( see Figure 3 ) .
