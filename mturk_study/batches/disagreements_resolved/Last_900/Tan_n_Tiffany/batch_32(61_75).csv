mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3466.png,"But part of the methodological elegance of this famous battery , developed about a half - century ago by Princeton University psychologist Hadley Cantril , is that respondents are n’t asked , directly , to evaluate their own progress in life . Rather , they are asked to imagine a ladder with ten steps , with 10 representing the highest possible quality of life for them and zero the lowest . Then they ’re asked which step of the ladder they feel they ’re on at the present time ; which step they were on five years ago ; and finally , which step they expect to be on five years from now . People are n’t asked to make “ better ” or “ worse ” judgments . They ’re simply asked to assign numerical ratings to their life at three different points in time . For example , in the 2006 Pew survey ( taken this summer ) , Americans on average gave a 6.1 score to their lives five years ago ; a 6.8 score to their present quality of life ; and a 7.8 score to the lives they expect to be leading five years from now .
