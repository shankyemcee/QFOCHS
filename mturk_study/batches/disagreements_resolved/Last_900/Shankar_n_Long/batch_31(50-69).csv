mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3061.png,"Unemployment rose appreciably over the course of the first President Bush ’s second year in office — from 5.4 % in January 1990 to 6.3 % by the end of the year . But the lead up to the invasion of Iraq produced a typical rally around the president in times of foreign crisis that kept Bush ’s approval ratings quite healthy . America ’s quick and relatively painless Gulf War victory sent his approval scores to record highs in the first quarter of 1991 obviating the political impact of a steady rise in unemployment … but not for long . Over the course of the remainder of the year , Bush ’s approval rating tumbled , falling from a high of 86 % in March to 50 % in December . Over that period , the unemployment rate rose from 6.4 % to 7.3 % . For much of Clinton ’s first term , unemployment rates and public judgments of the president were not in close correspondence . Unemployment declined from above 7 % at the time he took office to 5.5 % by the end of 1994 . However , Clinton ’s ratings were quite mixed for much of this time reflecting political difficulties ( the collapse of health care reform , and bitter fights over his crime bill and economic packages ) , as well as controversies over his past personal and financial involvements . However , Clinton ’s ratings began to improve in the fall of 1995 as a result of a successful showdown with Newt Gingrich over a shutdown of the federal government .
