mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/5977.png,"It is important to keep in mind that public beliefs about science and scientists are n’t necessarily indicators of trust , per se . One example involves public support for the products of scientific and technological innovation . A Pew Research Center survey found that about two - thirds of people see the effects of science on society as mostly positive , which is consistent with some 35 years of data from the General Social Survey . Looking at the components of trust in science across these three scientific areas — vaccines , climate change , and GM food — two patterns stand out . First , public trust in scientists is stronger , by comparison , than it is for several other groups in society . For example , many more people report trust in information from medical scientists , climate scientists , and GM food scientists than information from industry leaders , the news media , and elected officials . On the other hand , no more than about half of people hold strongly trusting views of scientists in any of these domains . For example , only 47 % of people say that medical scientists understand the health effects of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine “ very well . ” Some 43 % hold soft positive views of medical understanding about the MMR vaccine , saying medical scientists understand this issue “ fairly well . ” Public confidence in scientists is relatively strong compared with trust in other institutional groups . Only the military earns more confidence from the public . Still , people seem guarded . No more than a third of people report a “ great deal ” of confidence in any of these groups to act in the public interest . Overall , more people express positive than negative confidence in scientists , but a 55 % majority express only a soft confidence in scientists to act in the public interest . Public trust in scientists as sources of information is generally higher than it is for any of several other groups in society . For example , far more people trust medical scientists to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of childhood vaccines than they trust information from pharmaceutical industry leaders , the news media , or elected officials . The same pattern occurs for public trust in information from climate scientists and from GM food scientists .",same,How is public confidence different in institutional groups?,answer1,Public confidence in scientists is relatively strong compared with trust in other institutional groups .
