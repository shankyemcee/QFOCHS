Comparing current levels to those measured roughly four years ago , we find that , on average , the accuracy of telephone survey data is at least as high as it was in 2012 .

But there is no indication that the biases within groups got worse over time . Most major subgroups – defined by age , gender , race or education – saw the accuracy of their estimates from phone surveys either stay level or slightly improve .

One example involves public support for the products of scientific and technological innovation . A Pew Research Center survey found that about two - thirds of people see the effects of science on society as mostly positive , which is consistent with some 35 years of data from the General Social Survey . Looking at the components of trust in science across these three scientific areas — vaccines , climate change , and GM food — two patterns stand out . First , public trust in scientists is stronger , by comparison , than it is for several other groups in society . For example , many more people report trust in information from medical scientists , climate scientists , and GM food scientists than information from industry leaders , the news media , and elected officials . On the other hand , no more than about half of people hold strongly trusting views of scientists in any of these domains . For example , only 47 % of people say that medical scientists understand the health effects of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine “ very well . ” Some 43 % hold soft positive views of medical understanding about the MMR vaccine , saying medical scientists understand this issue “ fairly well . ” Public confidence in scientists is relatively strong compared with trust in other institutional groups . Only the military earns more confidence from the public . Still , people seem guarded . No more than a third of people report a “ great deal ” of confidence in any of these groups to act in the public interest . Overall , more people express positive than negative confidence in scientists , but a 55 % majority express only a soft confidence in scientists to act in the public interest . Public trust in scientists as sources of information is generally higher than it is for any of several other groups in society . For example , far more people trust medical scientists to provide full and accurate information about the health effects of childhood vaccines than they trust information from pharmaceutical industry leaders , the news media , or elected officials .
