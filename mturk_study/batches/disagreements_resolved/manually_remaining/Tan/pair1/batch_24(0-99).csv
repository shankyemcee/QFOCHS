mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/593.png,"In 2016 , according to the World Bank , the average applied U.S. tariff across all products was 1.61 % ; that was about the same as the average rate of 1.6 % for the 28 - nation EU , and not much higher than Japan ’s 1.35 % . Among other major U.S. trading partners , Canada ’s average applied tariff rate was 0.85 % , China ’s was 3.54 % and Mexico ’s was 4.36 % . ( Those average rates are weighted by product import shares with all of each nation ’s trading partners , and do n’t necessarily reflect the provisions of specific trade deals . Under NAFTA , for instance , most trade between the U.S. , Canada and Mexico is duty - free . ) That generations - long debate can be seen in the oscillations of U.S. tariff levels throughout history . In 1821 , when reliable tariff statistics begin , nearly all imports ( 95.5 % ) were taxed , and duties imposed equaled 43.2 % of the total value of all imports and 45 % of the dutiable value . For the next 100 + years , U.S. trade policy followed a fairly predictable pattern : When Democrats controlled the levers of power , tariff rates were lower ; when Whigs or Republicans regained control , rates were higher . The culmination of this perennial drama – what one contemporary writer called “ an endless performance in which the actors are unskilled and the audience dissatisfied ; and yet the same old play is staged over and over and over again ” – was the infamous Smoot - Hawley Tariff of 1930 , which raised import duties on thousands of agricultural and industrial goods .
