mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/836.png,"This overall decline in circulation coincided with a double - digit decline in advertising revenue for the industry as a whole . A separate Pew Research Center analysis based on the year - end financial statements of seven publicly traded U.S. newspaper companies suggests that advertising revenue across the industry declined even more sharply than in recent years : a 10 % decline , which outpaces the 8 % decline in 2015 . ( More details about this analysis are also available in the newspaper industry fact sheet . ) This decline put total ad revenue for the industry in 2016 at $ 18 billion . This is nearly a third of what it was just 10 years ago : In 2006 , the Newspaper Association of America , now known as the News Media Alliance , put total industry ad revenue at $ 49 billion . By contrast , circulation revenue has been steady over the past few years , rising from $ 10.4 billion in 2012 to $ 10.9 billion in both 2015 and 2016 . This is a small bright spot for the industry , and comes as some publishers are pursuing a “ subscription - first model ” by focusing on growing the number of subscribers rather than retaining advertising revenue . Still , gains in circulation revenue have not been nearly enough to make up for losses in advertising revenue – a pattern that holds true even at the large newspapers and major chains . According to year - end financial statements , The New York Times saw a year - over - year decline of 9 % in advertising revenue but a 3 % rise in circulation revenue , for an overall revenue decline of 2 % . Tronc , which has emphasized digital innovation in changing its name from Tribune Publishing , saw an 8 % decline in advertising revenue and a 4 % decline in total revenue , though circulation revenue increased 5 % . ( Tronc owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , among other papers . ) And Gannett saw no change in its advertising revenue , but this was due mainly to the company ’s acquisition of additional newspapers over the course of the year ; once these new acquisitions are taken out of the equation , ad revenue declined by 13 % . ( The Washington Post , as a private company , does not publish its financial results , but the company ’s chief revenue officer said in a recent New York Times article that 2017 would be “ our third straight year of double - digit revenue growth . ” )",same,"How's about newspapers circulation declining?",answer2,"This overall decline in circulation coincided with a double - digit decline in advertising revenue for the industry as a whole .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/856.png,"A number of long - standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or stalled in 2016 , as black voter turnout decreased , white turnout increased and the nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate remained flat since the 2012 election . Here are some key takeaways from the Census Bureau ’s report , the data source with the most comprehensive demographic and statistical portrait of U.S. voters . The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election , falling to 59.6 % in 2016 after reaching a record - high 66.6 % in 2012 . The 7 - percentage - point decline from the previous presidential election is the largest on record for blacks . ( It ’s also the largest percentage - point decline among any racial or ethnic group since white voter turnout dropped from 70.2 % in 1992 to 60.7 % in 1996 . ) The number of black voters also declined , falling by about 765,000 to 16.4 million in 2016 , representing a sharp reversal from 2012 . With Barack Obama on the ballot that year , the black voter turnout rate surpassed that of whites for the first time . Among whites , the 65.3 % turnout rate in 2016 represented a slight increase from 64.1 % in 2012 . The Latino voter turnout rate held steady at 47.6 % in 2016 , compared with 48.0 % in 2012 . Overall turnout remained flat despite expectations heading into Election Day of a long - awaited , historic surge in Latino voters . Due largely to demographic growth , the number of Latino voters grew to a record 12.7 million in 2016 , up from 11.2 million in 2012 . Even so , the number of Latino nonvoters – those eligible to vote who do not cast a ballot , or 14 million in 2016 – was larger than the number of Latino voters , a trend that extends back to each presidential election since 1996 . Meanwhile , the Asian voter turnout rate increased to 49.3 % in 2016 , up from 46.9 % in 2012 and surpassing Hispanics for the first time since 1996 . Asians continue to represent a smaller share of voters than Hispanics : Overall , about 5 million Asians voted in 2016 , up from 3.8 million in 2012 . The number of naturalized - citizen voters reached 10.8 million in 2016 , up from 9.3 million in 2012 . In a year when immigration played a central role in the presidential campaign , turnout among naturalized - citizen voters ( those who were immigrants born in another country who have naturalized to become U.S. citizens ) was 54.3 % , up from 53.6 % in 2012 . Overall , the voter turnout rate among foreign - born citizens trailed that of U.S.-born voters , who had a 62.1 % turnout rate in 2016 . But among Asians and Hispanics – the nation ’s two largest immigrant groups – the pattern was reversed . In 2016 , turnout among Asian naturalized citizens was 51.9 % , compared with 44.9 % for U.S.-born Asians .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/875.png,"For the analysis – which covers the period from 1991 to 2010 and includes comparisons with changes in the United States – “ middle - class ” or “ middle - income ” adults in a country are those who live in households with disposable ( after - tax ) incomes ranging from two - thirds to double the country ’s median disposable household income . Thus , the income it takes to be middle class varies across countries . Also , estimates in the new report will not match those in the Center ’s previous reports , which were based on a household ’s gross ( pretax ) income . Among Western Europe ’s six largest economies , the shares of adults living in middle - income households increased in France , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , but they shrank in Germany , Italy and Spain . From 1991 to 2010 , the middle - class share in the UK increased from 61 % to 67 % , but it decreased from 78 % to 72 % in Germany . Among the 11 Western European countries examined , the expansion in the UK was second only to the increase in Ireland , where the share increased from 60 % in 1991 to 69 % in 2010 . The decrease in Germany was the second largest after Finland , where the middle - class share fell from 82 % to 75 % over the same period . Overall , the middle - class share of the adult population fell in seven of the 11 Western European countries examined , mirroring the long - term shrinking of the middle class in the U.S. In most countries studied , decreasing shares of middle - income populations led to rising shares of adults in lower- and upper - income tiers . These shifts signal a sharpening of economic divisions among households in many Western European countries and the U.S. However , there is also a general improvement in the economic status of adults because the movement up the income ladder was greater than the movement downward in most countries from 1991 to 2010 . Compared with Western Europe , the U.S. middle class is smaller . Among the countries examined , the U.S. is the only country in which fewer than six - in - ten adults were in the middle class in 2010 . Meanwhile , compared with many Western European countries , greater shares of Americans were either lower income ( 26 % ) or upper income ( 15 % ) . Thus , U.S. households were more economically divided than households in the Western European countries analyzed . In the Western European countries , middle - class shares in 2010 ranged from 64 % in Spain to 80 % in Denmark and Norway .
