It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % ,   respectively ,   likely to turn out . Steadfast Conservatives are staunch critics of government and are socially conservative . Business Conservatives prefer limited government , but are far more moderate on social issues than Steadfast Conservatives and favor immigration reform . We estimate that these two groups constitute only 22 % of the general public , but because they are so engaged with politics , these groups make up 38 % of the likely electorate . On the left , the Solid Liberals are solidly Democratic in their vote preference ( 93 % ) among likely voters and are uniformly liberal across nearly every realm – government , the economy , business , the environment and foreign policy , as well as on social issues . But they are somewhat less likely than the two conservative groups to vote ; we forecasted that 54 % of them will turn out to vote .",same,"Which groups are more motivated to vote than other groups?",answer1,"It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % , respectively ,","It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups , with 67 % and 66 % ,  "," ","respectively","respectively"," "," ","Who will turn out to vote in November?
