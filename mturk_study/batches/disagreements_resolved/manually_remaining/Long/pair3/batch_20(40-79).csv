mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/21837.png,"While the national media divided its time last week among a host of major news stories , the public remained intensely focused on the situation in Iraq . Fully 36 % of Americans paid very closely attention to events in Iraq and 35 % said this was the news story they followed more closely than any other . Another 12 % of the public listed the debate over Iraq policy as the story they followed most closely .

Interest in the 2008 presidential campaign has remained fairly consistent in recent weeks , even while the amount of coverage has fluctuated depending on campaign events and the demands of competing news stories . This past week 18 % of the public followed campaign news very closely and another 31 % followed it fairly closely . Roughly one - in - ten listed the campaign as their most closely followed story .
