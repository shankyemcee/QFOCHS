The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation .

Second , what Pew Research described as classified information the WP / ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti - terrorism efforts ; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism .
