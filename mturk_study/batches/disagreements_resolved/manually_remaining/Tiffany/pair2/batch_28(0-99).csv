In the last presidential election , for instance , Boomers who came of age during the Nixon administration ( born between 1951 and 1956 ) favored Barack Obama over Mitt Romney to a greater degree than people who were slightly older or younger . Those who came of age during the Clinton administration ( those born 1975 to 1982 , mostly younger Xers ) were significantly more likely to favor Obama than the national average , while those who turned 18 during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ( primarily older Xers and younger Boomers ) were more Republican in their preferences . As of the 2012 election , both older and younger Millennials favored Obama by wide margins . Those who came of age during Bush ’s presidency ( those born 1983 to 1990 , older Millennials ) favored Obama over Romney by 19 percentage points more than the national average . Those who came of age during Obama ’s first term ( born 1991 to 1994 , mostly younger Millennials ) voted for Obama by an even wider margin ."

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1853.png,"Researchers disagree about why people leave the labor force and how likely they are ever to return . In a report issued in February , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that about half the decline in labor - force participation was due to long - term demographic trends , a third was due to cyclical weaknesses in the labor market , and the rest a consequence of “ unusually protracted weakness in the demand for labor [ which ] appears to have led some workers to become discouraged and permanently drop out of the labor force , ” such as by taking early retirement or signing up for Social Security disability benefits . But two Federal Reserve economists have argued that cyclical factors , rather than demographic shifts , account for the bulk of the drop in labor - force participation since 2007 . Economists are especially interested in the subset of non - participants who are considered “ marginally attached ” to the labor force . Those people are n’t counted as unemployed , because they have n’t looked for work in the past four weeks , but they have job - hunted sometime in the past year and say both that they want a job and are available to take one right away . Many labor economists believe marginally attached people are most likely to be drawn back into the labor force . But discouraged workers make up only about 35 % of all marginally attached workers , and account for just over half the increase in their ranks since the 2008 financial panic . The rest of the marginally attached cite a range of reasons for not having looked for work recently , including family responsibilities , being in school , ill health , and problems with child care or transportation .",same,Describe the reasons why workers haven't looked for work.,answer2,"Discouraged workers make up only about 35 % of all marginally attached workers .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/1865.png,"On Election Day , ca n’t you just smell the excitement in the air ? Actually , you probably ca n’t : An overwhelming majority of voters live in congressional districts with little real competition , and a handful without any at all . A Pew Research Center report last week used ratings and analyses by such sources as the Cook Political Report and Real Clear Politics to estimate that there are only 14 truly competitive House elections this year . But the ratings are only predictions , and if history is any guide several more House races will turn out closer than expected . In 2012 , for instance , 29 House candidates won by less than 5 percentage points over their closest rival ; another 34 won by at least five but fewer than 10 percentage points . Still , that ’s only 63 races out of 435 House districts , representing around 15 % of eligible voters . We wondered how those figures compare with earlier elections , so we examined data from two separate sources . Using data from the Census Bureau ’s American Community Survey , we estimated how many eligible voters there were in each congressional district from 2006 ( when the ACS series begins ) through 2012 . ( Quick refresher : Eligible voters are 18 years or older and either native - born or naturalized U.S. citizens . ) We obtained vote totals for every House race from the House Clerk ’s office . As it turns out , the number of close races — those decided by fewer than 5 percentage points — does n’t vary all that much from election cycle to election cycle : from a low of 25 in 2008 up to 38 in the Tea Party year of 2010 , when Republicans regained control of the House . Raising the victory - margin threshold to 10 percentage points roughly doubled the number of districts that could be considered competitive .

CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News are all trusted by more than four - in - ten web - using U.S. adults . These high numbers , though , are intertwined with the fact that more than nine - in - ten respondents have heard of these five news sources . Trust and distrust were only asked of sources respondents had heard of , thus , the better known a source is , the more Americans in total who can voice trust or distrust of that source . A source like The Economist , on the other hand , is known by just 34 % of respondents and so could never have a trust level exceeding 34 % — even if everyone who had heard of it trusted it . What about the ratio of trust to distrust ? Another way to think of trust is to compare trust and distrust in a news source . In other words , what is the ratio of people who trust a news outlet to those who distrust it ? This ratio is based just on those who have rated the sources as trusted or distrusted , regardless of how well known the source is . The result is a different list of news brands : The Economist , BBC , NPR , PBS and The Wall Street Journal are among those with the highest ratio of trust to distrust – even if the overall percentages of those who trust them are smaller than for some other sources .

This is due largely to fast growth in the number of Hispanic and Asian school - age children born in the U.S. , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data . A steady demographic change over the years has resulted in a decline in the number of whites in classrooms even as the total number of public school students has increased . In 1997 , the U.S. had 46.1 million public school students , of which 63.4 % were white . While whites will still outnumber any single racial or ethnic group this fall , their overall share of the nation ’s 50 million public school students is projected to drop to 49.7 % . Since 1997 , the number of white students has declined by 15 % , falling from 29.2 million to 24.9 million in 2014 . While the number of white students has declined , there have been large enrollment increases of Hispanics and Asians , two groups that have seen overall population growth . Since 1997 , the number of Hispanic students nearly doubled to 12.9 million , and the number of Asians jumped 46 % to 2.6 million .
