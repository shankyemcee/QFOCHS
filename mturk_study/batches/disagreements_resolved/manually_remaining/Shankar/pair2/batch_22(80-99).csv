Fewer than one - in - ten American Muslims say that suicide bombing is sometimes ( 7 % ) or often ( 1 % ) justified . Over the course of the decade , the Pew Global Attitudes Project has asked this same question of Muslim populations around the world , and results show that Muslims in the U.S. are among the most likely to reject suicide bombing . Among the populations surveyed recently , opposition to suicide bombing is highest in Pakistan ( 87 % say it is never justified ) — a nation currently plagued by suicide bombings and violence by extremist groups . As recently as 2004 , only 35 % of Pakistani Muslims held this view . As Pew Global Attitudes surveys have documented , the growing rejection of extremism in Pakistan is part of a broader pattern in the Muslim world . Most European Muslims surveyed agree that suicide attacks can never be justified . This view is especially prevalent in Germany , where 83 % of the country ’s largely Turkish Muslim community say that suicide attacks are not justifiable .
