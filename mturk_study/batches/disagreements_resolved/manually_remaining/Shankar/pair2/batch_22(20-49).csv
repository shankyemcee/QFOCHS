Adults younger than 30 are most likely to favor a dual - income marriage model ( 72 % ) , over the breadwinner husband - homemaker wife model ( 22 % ) . This is even more true for young women , who are more likely than young men to prefer dual - income marriage ( 78 % vs. 67 % ) . Young adults are also more positive about the impact on families of increasing numbers of women entering the workforce . However , it ’s not the case . When we took a closer look at the most recent American Community Survey data , we found that 57 % of young married couples ( where the wife is younger than 30 ) are in a dual - income marriage , compared with 62 % of couples in their 30s and 40s .

But in Egypt , the government ’s restrictions also are coupled with a Muslim public that is considerably less tolerant of religious pluralism than Muslims elsewhere . Those actions earn Egypt an overall score of 8.9 out of 10 on the 2011 Government Restrictions Index — a scale developed by Pew Research to gauge government restrictions on religion in nearly 200 countries and territories over time .
