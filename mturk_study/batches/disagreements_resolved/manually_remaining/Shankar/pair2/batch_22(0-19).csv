In the 2008 presidential election , for example , nearly 59 % of estimated eligible voters voted in that year ’s House elections . Two years later for the midterms , only about 41 % of eligible voters went to the polls .

A race where victory could go either way might spur more interest and rev up get - out - the - vote efforts from both sides ; a race where one candidate is a prohibitive favorite could lead many people to conclude there ’s no point in heading out to vote . But our analysis shows little , if any , correlation between a House election ’s competitiveness ( measured by the winner ’s victory margin ) and turnout .
