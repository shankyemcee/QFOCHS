mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/201.png,"Preliminary data suggest the total number of deportations is likely to have dropped again in fiscal 2015 . The number of deportations reported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was down by 25 % from fiscal 2014 to 2015 , from 315,943 to 235,413 . There was a sharper decrease in deportations of unauthorized immigrants apprehended within the U.S. rather than at the border . ( Data from ICE represent only a part of all deportations carried out by DHS and do not include deportations by U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement . ) In addition , border apprehensions have also declined . The 337,117 Border Patrol apprehensions in fiscal 2015 are the lowest since 1971 . One reason for the decline in apprehensions is an overall decline in the number of immigrants coming to the United States . The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population peaked in 2007 and has since leveled off . It ’s a trend driven largely by changes in Mexican migration , the country of origin of about half ( 49 % ) of all unauthorized immigrants . Today more Mexicans are returning home to Mexico than arriving in the U.S. Family reunification was the most common reason cited by Mexicans for their return migration .
