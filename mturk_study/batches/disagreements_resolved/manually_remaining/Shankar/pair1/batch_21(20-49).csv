And contrary to the current narrative that polls are under siege , the data show that the bias introduced into survey data by current levels of participation is limited in scope . This report is the fourth in a series of Center studies tracking the impact of such changes in survey response ( see previous studies in 1997 , 2003 and 2012 . ) Among the key findings : After decades of decline , the response rates for telephone polls like those conducted for Pew Research Center have stabilized in recent years to around 9%1,2 While the stabilization is good news for the industry , such low response rates do signal the potential for bias to creep into surveys if the people who consistently participate in polls are different than those who do not . That said , the current study and prior research suggest that response rate is an unreliable indicator of bias .",same,"Tell about telephone polls response rates trends since 1997?",answer2,"After decades of decline , the response rates for telephone polls have stabilized in recent years to around 9% .","After decades of decline , the response rates for telephone polls have stabilized in recent years to around 9%1,2 .",".","","9%","9%1,2"," ","Despite overall decrease, response rates have stabilized over past four years Response rate by year (%)","After decades of decline , the response rates for telephone polls have stabilized in recent years to around 9%1,2"
