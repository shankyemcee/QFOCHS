mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/two_col/660.png,"As Barack Obama takes office , the public ’s focus is overwhelmingly on domestic policy concerns – particularly the economy . Strengthening the nation ’s economy and improving the job situation stand at the top of the public ’s list of domestic priorities for 2009 . Meanwhile , the priority placed on issues such as the environment , crime , illegal immigration and even reducing health care costs has fallen off from a year ago . The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & amp ; the Press , conducted Jan. 7 - 11 among 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines , finds that strengthening the economy and improving the job situation are higher priorities today than they have been at any point over the past decade , and the recent upward trend has been steep . The share of Americans saying that strengthening the nation ’s economy should be a top priority has risen from 68 % two years ago to 75 % last January to 85 % today .

Of the 20 issues people were asked to rate in both January 2008 and January 2009 , five have slipped significantly in importance as attention to the economy has surged . Protecting the environment fell the most precipitously – just 41 % rate this as a top priority today , down from 56 % a year ago . The percentage rating illegal immigration as a top priority has fallen from 51 % to 41 % over the past year , and reducing crime has fallen by a similar amount ( from 54 % to 46 % ) .
