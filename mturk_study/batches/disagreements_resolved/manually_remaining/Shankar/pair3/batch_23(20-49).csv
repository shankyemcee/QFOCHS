Six - in - ten ( 59 % ) people in the U.S. say religion plays a very important role in their lives . This is roughly twice the percentage of self - avowed religious people in Canada ( 30 % ) , and an even higher proportion when compared with Japan and Western Europe . Americans ’ views are closer to people in developing nations than to the publics of developed nations . The 44 - nation survey of the Pew Global Attitudes Project shows stark global regional divides over the personal importance of religion.[1 ] In Africa , no fewer than eight - in - ten in any country see religion as very important personally . Majorities in every Latin American country also subscribe to that view , with the exception of Argentina . More than nine - in - ten respondents in the predominantly Muslim nations of Indonesia , Pakistan , Mali and Senegal rate religion as personally very important . In Turkey and Uzbekistan , however , people are more divided over religion ’s importance . Secularism is particularly prevalent throughout Europe . Even in heavily Catholic Italy fewer than three - in - ten ( 27 % ) people say religion is very important personally , a lack of intensity in belief that is consistent with opinion in other Western European nations . Attitudes are comparable in former Soviet bloc countries .

And in Poland , the birthplace of the Pope and where the Catholic Church played a pivotal role during the communist era , just 36 % say religion is very important . The Global Attitudes study correlated views on religion with annual per capita income and found that wealthier nations tend to place less importance on religion — with the exception of the United States . This is seen most clearly in Asia , where publics in the two wealthiest nations surveyed — Japan and South Korea — are far less likely to cite religion as personally important than those in poorer nations of the region .

Britons with favorable views of the governing Conservative Party were less likely than those with unfavorable views of the party to express a positive opinion of the EU .
