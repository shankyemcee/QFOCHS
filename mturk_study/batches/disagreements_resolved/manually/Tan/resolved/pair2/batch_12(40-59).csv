This correction does not materially change the analysis of the report . In the context of these ongoing arguments over the role and nature of bots , Pew Research Center set out to better understand how many of the links being shared on Twitter – most of which refer to a site outside the platform itself – are being promoted by bots rather than humans . To do this , the Center used a list of 2,315 of the most popular websites1 and examined the roughly 1.2 million tweets ( sent by English language users ) that included links to those sites during a roughly six - week period in summer 2017 . The results illustrate the pervasive role that automated accounts play in disseminating links to a wide range of prominent websites on Twitter .
