mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/5931.png,"4 Americans have long argued about whether nativity scenes and other religious holiday displays on public property violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution ’s First Amendment . In the 1980s , the Supreme Court handed down two landmark rulings that allow for displays of Christmas crèches , Hanukkah menorah and other religious holiday symbols on public property so long as they do not actively endorse or promote a particular religion or religion in general . In practice , religious symbols that are a part of larger secular holiday display ( containing , say , Christmas trees , Santa Claus and reindeer ) have had a much better chance of surviving a court challenge than those displays that are solely or more overtly religious . 5 Most Americans believe that elements of the biblical Christmas story reflect actual historical events , although the percentage expressing this view has dropped noticeably in recent years . Two - thirds ( 66 % ) say Jesus was born to a virgin , compared with 73 % who said this in 2014 ; 75 % believe he was laid in a manger , down from 81 % . Similarly , the shares who say they believe that wise men , guided by a star , brought Jesus gifts — and that an angel appeared to shepherds to announce the birth of Jesus — also have declined . A slim majority of U.S. adults ( 57 % ) believe that all four of these things actually happened , down from 65 % three years ago .
