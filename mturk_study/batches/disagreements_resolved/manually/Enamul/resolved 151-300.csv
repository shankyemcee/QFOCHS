But despite these findings and amid some high profile controversies , Facebook users as a whole are just as active on the site today as they were a year ago . Roughly three - quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day . These shares are identical to those reported by Facebook users in the Center ’s 2018 social media use survey . Majorities of Snapchat and Instagram users also say they visit these sites daily , though they are slightly less likely than Facebook users to do so . The shares of young adults using these platforms daily are especially large . Roughly eight - in - ten Snapchat users ages 18 to 29 ( 77 % ) say they use the app every day , including 68 % who say they do so multiple times day . Similarly , 76 % of Instagram users in this age group visit the site on a daily basis , with 60 % reporting that they do so several times per day . These patterns are largely similar to what the Center found in 2018 . Other platforms are visited somewhat less frequently . Some 51 % of YouTube users say they visit the site daily – a slight increase from the 45 % who said this in 2018 .",same,Describe the trend of Facebook users usage of the site on daily basis?,answer2,"Roughly three - quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day .","Roughly three - quarters of Facebook users ( 74 % ) visit the site daily , including about half who do so several times a day .",,,
