mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/6843.png,"As part of a larger survey of Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 , Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens . The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application . These appear to be significant barriers , as nearly all lawful immigrants from Mexico said they would like to become U.S. citizens someday . In the United States , the citizenship , or naturalization , rate among all lawful immigrants steadily increased from 1995 to 2005 , rising from 47 % to 62 % . Until about 2005 , the naturalization rate among lawful immigrants from Mexico also increased steadily , but did so more rapidly ( from 20 % in 1995 to 38 % in 2005 ) , narrowing the gap between Mexicans and other immigrants . However , between 2005 and 2010 , the naturalization rate of Mexican green - card holders leveled off , even as the rate for lawful permanent residents from other parts of the globe continued to rise . Only in the period from 2011 to 2015 did the rate of naturalization among eligible Mexican immigrants significantly increase again at a pace higher than that of other lawful U.S. immigrants – going from 38 % to 42 % among Mexicans , compared with a 2 - percentage - point increase , from 72 % to 74 % among non - Mexican immigrants .",same,What was the reason why Mexican green-card holders had not yet become naturalized U.S. citizens?,answer1,"The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application","The most frequent reasons centered on inadequate English skills , lack of time or initiative , and the cost of the U.S. citizenship application",,As part a larger survey Hispanic immigrants fielded in late 2015 Pew Research Center asked Mexican green - card holders why they had not yet become naturalized citizens .,
