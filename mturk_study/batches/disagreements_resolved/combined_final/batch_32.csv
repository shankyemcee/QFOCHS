mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3581.png,"Although adult English / Spanish bilingual Latinos have some proficiency in speaking both English and Spanish , they tend to use the languages differently depending on the setting . English is far and away the dominant language of U.S. commerce and trade , and dominates U.S. workplaces . English / Spanish bilingual Latinos report that they largely speak English in the workplace . About 60 % of bilingual Hispanic workers usually speak more English than Spanish at work ( 29 % ) , or use only English at work ( 33 % ) . Widespread Spanish language usage at work is relatively rare among bilingual workers . About one in ten report speaking “ more Spanish than English ” or “ only Spanish ” at work ( see Figure 3 ) . English / Spanish bilingual Hispanics seem to be markedly different from the wider Hispanic adult population in their mass media preferences . The survey asked respondents whether they typically received news ( via TV or radio ) in English or Spanish . Almost 40 % of all Latino adults said either “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English , ” reflecting the usage patterns of Latino adults with little speaking ability in English . Bilingual Latinos extensively use English to obtain news broadcasts , as Figure 3 illustrates . Nearly five in ten bilingual Hispanics hear news in “ English only ” or “ more English than Spanish . ” Less than a fifth reported obtaining news in “ only Spanish ” or “ more Spanish than English . ” So the preponderance of bilingual speaking Latinos either obtains news in English , or does not express an exclusive preference for hearing news in Spanish . At home English / Spanish speaking Latinos are about evenly divided in their use of Spanish and English ( see Figure 3 ) . About a third either speaks more Spanish than English ( 17 % ) or only speaks Spanish at home ( 17 % ) .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3501.png,"The rising political clout of evangelical Christians is not the result of growth in their numbers but rather of their increasing cohesiveness as a key element of the Republican Party . The proportion of the population composed of white evangelicals has changed very little ( 19 % in 1987 ; 22 % now ) and what growth there was occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s . However , in 1987 , white evangelical Protestants were closely divided in their partisan attachments , with 34 % identifying as Republicans and 29 % as Democrats . The shift toward Republican identification among white evangelicals came in two stages . In the late 1980s , white evangelicals in the South were still mostly wedded to the Democratic Party while evangelicals outside the South were more aligned with the GOP . But over the course of the next decade or so , the GOP made gains among white Southerners generally – and evangelicals in particular – nearly eliminating this regional disparity . Since the election of George W. Bush in 2000 , Republican identification has grown among both Southern and non - Southern evangelicals . Today , Republicans outnumber Democrats among white evangelicals by more than two - to - one ( 51%-22 % ) , and hold a 63%-29 % lead when partisan “ leaners ” are included . Although Republican Party identification among both evangelicals and non - evangelicals increased slightly following the September 11 attacks , it has since retreated to pre-9/11 levels for non - evangelicals .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3466.png,"But part of the methodological elegance of this famous battery , developed about a half - century ago by Princeton University psychologist Hadley Cantril , is that respondents are n’t asked , directly , to evaluate their own progress in life .

Then they ’re asked which step of the ladder they feel they ’re on at the present time ; which step they were on five years ago ; and finally , which step they expect to be on five years from now . People are n’t asked to make “ better ” or “ worse ” judgments . They ’re simply asked to assign numerical ratings to their life at three different points in time .

mturk_charts/no_data_remaining/multi_col/3454.png,"Most Americans feel the press has gone overboard in covering the death of Anna Nicole Smith . Fully 61 % believe the Smith story has been overcovered , far more than the number saying that about any other recent story . Even so , a sizable minority ( 11 % ) followed Smith ’s death more closely than any of last week ’s other top stories . This is on par with the number who cited news about the 2008 presidential candidates ( 13 % ) or the Super Bowl ( 11 % ) as the stories they followed most closely . The war in Iraq was the top story for the week of Feb. 5 , with 30 % following it most closely . Data collected since the start of the year suggest that the public and the press are often in agreement about the most important news stories of the day . The Iraq war has consistently been the top - ranked news story both in terms of public interest and press coverage . In the News Interest Index survey for the week of Feb. 5 ( conducted Feb. 9 - 12 ) , 30 % of Americans said the situation in Iraq was the story they followed most closely , nearly double the next highest story – winter weather . During that same week , 22 % of the news reported across a broad spectrum of media outlets was devoted to the Iraq war ( 12 % to the policy debate and 10 % to events on the ground ) , according to PEJ . The death of Anna Nicole Smith , which set off a classic media feeding frenzy , may be an instance where press coverage exceeded public demand . Eleven percent of the public said Smith ’s death was the news story they followed most closely last week ; 9 % of the week ’s news coverage was devoted to this topic . But because the death occurred mid - week , the full extent of news coverage is not accurately captured by that 9 % figure . In the two days immediately following Smith ’s death ( Feb. 8 - 9 ) , nearly a quarter of the news from all sectors ( 24 % ) was devoted to this story , and fully half of cable news was focused on Smith . The public reacted negatively to the abundance of coverage – 61 % feel that the Smith story received too much coverage , compared with just 8 % who think it should have received more . It seems that news coverage of the weather did not match the public ’s fascination with it .
