Unfortunately , the CPS does not ask its respondents whether they personally access the internet using a cellular data plan . This CPS estimate lines up closely with the 2018 National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) , which estimates that 79 % of U.S. adults would say yes to a very simple question , “ Do you use the internet ? ” Another potential measurement wrinkle comes from the various types of activities people can engage in on the internet . Some might equate “ using the internet ” with web browsing alone , inadvertently excluding email . Someone who only checks their email via a standalone email client or a mobile app could potentially say they do n’t use the internet . Fortunately , the NHIS also asks respondents whether they send or receive emails . If we combine this with the previous estimate , we get a slight uptick to 81 % of U.S. adults who either “ use the internet ” or use email . While these varied approaches to measuring internet use can be bewildering , they all tell roughly the same story when viewed over time .

( The survey question did not include all racial and ethnic groups , such as Native Hawaiians , Pacific Islanders , American Indians and Alaska Natives , or multiracial Americans , in its wording about the nation ’s future diversity . ) While these views have changed little since 2018 , the public expresses more positive – and less negative – views of the long - term rise in racial and ethnic diversity than it did four years ago , during the last presidential campaign . Since then , the share saying a majority Black , Hispanic and Asian population is a good thing has increased by 10 percentage points , while there has been a comparable decline ( 11 points ) in the share saying it is bad thing ."
