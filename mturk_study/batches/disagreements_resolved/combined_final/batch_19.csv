An additional factor that likely affected the responses to the Fox News question was the context in which it was presented .

Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified ? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified , by a 52%-33 % margin . The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation . First , Pew Research referred to the decision to subpoena phone records while the WP / ABC survey said the records were obtained … through a court order , which may make the actions seem more legitimate by highlighting a court ’s involvement . Second , what Pew Research described as classified information the WP / ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti - terrorism efforts ; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism . Third , Pew Research mentioned the Justice Department , while WP / ABC mentioned federal prosecutors .
