Although there are still more people without jobs than there are job openings – about 6.9 million people reported being unemployed in May – the monthly estimate of open positions has been above 5.5 million for all but one month since the start of 2016 , a sign of the U.S. economy ’s relative health . In July 2009 , just past the trough of the Great Recession , employers reported fewer than 2.2 million job openings , the lowest total since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting JOLTS data in 2000 . Another way of looking at the vacancies data is the job openings rate , which is calculated by dividing the total number of openings by the sum of total employment and openings . ( The higher the rate , the greater the nation ’s unmet demand for labor . ) The openings rate was a robust 4 % in April , matching the high points reached in July 2015 and July 2016 . Like the total number of job openings , the openings rate bottomed out in July 2009 , at 1.7 % .

The relatively high number of Millennial households in poverty partly reflects the fact that the poverty rate among households headed by a young adult has been rising over the past half century while dramatically declining among households headed by those 65 and older .
