For roughly 15 years , independent studies suggested that the answer to that question was generally “ no ” if the goal was to make accurate population estimates.1 Over time , though , researchers and sample vendors have developed technologies and statistical techniques aimed at improving the representativeness of online nonprobability surveys . Several recent case studies suggest a future ( some would argue a present ) in which researchers need not have an expensive , probability - based sample to make accurate population estimates . Nearly all of the questions ( 52 ) were also asked on waves of the Center ’s probability - based American Trends Panel ( ATP ) , which is conducted predominantly online but features mail response for adults who do not have internet access . The samples were evaluated using a range of metrics , including estimated bias on 20 full sample survey estimates for which high quality government benchmarks are available , estimated bias for major demographic subgroup estimates , and predictive accuracy of four different regression models . Among the most important findings of this study are the following : There is also evidence , though less consistent , that online nonprobability samples tilt more toward certain lifestyles .

There was no overall consensus among the public in our survey on what holds women back from gaining top elective offices , though women were far more likely than men to cite societal and institutional factors as major reasons . About half ( 47 % ) of women said that a major reason there are not more women in top political offices is that female candidates are held to higher standards than men , compared with 28 % of men who said so . Four - in - ten women ( 41 % ) , compared with three - in - ten men ( 31 % ) , said that a major reason for the lack of women in top political offices is that many Americans are n’t ready to elect a woman to a higher office .

Relatively small shares of men ( 15 % ) and women ( 18 % ) said that family responsibilities are a major reason that fewer women hold elective offices . There were generational differences among women in our survey on the attributes that a woman brings to political office . Younger women were less likely to give female leaders an edge over male leaders , and instead were more likely to say men and women are equally likely to possess certain traits . For example , when it comes to working out compromises , 33 % of Millennial women and 37 % of Generation X women said women are better than men , compared with about half of women from the Baby Boomer ( 47 % ) and Silent ( 50 % ) generations who said so .

A new Pew Research Center survey , conducted in association with the Markle Foundation , and analysis of government data finds that employment in occupations requiring more education and training is on the rise , and many workers are realizing that retraining and upgrading their skills needs to be a lifetime commitment . Employment has been rising faster in occupations requiring more preparation . As of 2015 , some 83 million people worked in jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation ( including education , experience and job training ) , up from 49 million in 1980 – a 68 % increase .

And they are more likely than white or mixed - race South Africans to believe that young people should stay in South Africa to pursue a good life , rather than leave for another country . And while majorities of all three groups say the government is run for the benefit of only a few groups in society , whites and mixed - race respondents are more inclined than blacks to think so . Nigerian public opinion frequently divides along religious lines , with notable differences between Muslims and Christians . In our current poll , Muslims are much more upbeat about the economy , and more likely to believe that the national economy will improve in the next 12 months . Although majorities of both groups see inequality as a very big problem , Christians are especially likely to hold this view . And opinions about the fairness of government have shifted over the past year , perhaps reflecting a transition of power from former President Goodluck Jonathan , a Christian , to current President Muhammadu Buhari , a Muslim .
