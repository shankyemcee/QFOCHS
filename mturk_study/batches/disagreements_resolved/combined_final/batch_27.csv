Hispanic voters this year make up an even larger share of the state ’s registered voters than in past years , but the profile of the Latino electorate has shifted over the past decade or so , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of state voter registration data . Due to the state ’s large Cuban voting bloc , the Latino vote had been reliably Republican . For example , President George W. Bush won both the Hispanic vote and the state in 2004 . But 2008 represented a tipping point : More Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans , and the gap has only widened since then .

At the same time , the number of Latino registered voters in Florida who indicate no party affiliation has also grown rapidly during this time , and by 2012 had surpassed Republican registrations .
