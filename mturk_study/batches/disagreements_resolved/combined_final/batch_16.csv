mturk_charts/no_data/multi_col/10091.png,"But perhaps just as striking is that the geographic distribution of the poor has changed dramatically , too . A new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data finds that the South continues to be home to many of America ’s poor , though to a lesser degree than a half - century ago . In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South . By 2010 , that share had dropped to 41 % . Much of the geographic shift of poverty reflects general trends in population shifts across the country over that same period . As rural areas , such as in the Midwest , have become less impoverished since the 1960s , those areas make up a smaller share of the U.S. population overall . At the same time , urban centers have gained in total population and hold a greater share of the U.S. population overall .",same,What is the distribution of Americans lived in the South in 1960?,answer2,"In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South .","In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South .",.,,,"Nation's Poor Population Is Less Southern, More Urban Than in 1960 Share of nation's impoverished population BY COUNTY POPULATION","In 1960 , half ( 49 % ) of impoverished Americans lived in the South"

By 2055 , the U.S. will not have a single racial or ethnic majority . Much of this change has been ( and will be ) driven by immigration . Nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. in the past 50 years , mostly from Latin America and Asia . Today , a near - record 14 % of the country ’s population is foreign born compared with just 5 % in 1965 .

More Americans say immigrants strengthen the country than say they burden it , and most say the U.S. ’s increasing ethnic diversity makes it a better place to live . Asia has replaced Latin America ( including Mexico ) as the biggest source of new immigrants to the U.S. In a reversal of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history , net migration flows from Mexico to the U.S. turned negative between 2009 and 2014 , as more Mexicans went home than arrived in the U.S. And after rising steadily since 1990 , the unauthorized immigrant population has leveled off in recent years , falling to 11.3 million in 2014 from a high of 12.2 million in 2007 .
