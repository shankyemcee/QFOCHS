# Human Evaluation
- This folder contains my drafted method of how to perform the human evaluation
- This folder is also simpler than the Statista one as the Statista one had issues with the model outputs being changed midway
- You can use the `qfcs_model_evaluation/` as a base for the interface
	- `processing_outputs/` also shows how to process the outputs from the interface
