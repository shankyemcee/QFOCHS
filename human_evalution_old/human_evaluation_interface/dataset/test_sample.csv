But whatever yesterday ’s votes portend , polls have been showing a decline in Tea Party support among Republicans since their peak of influence in 2010 . In asking Republicans whether they agree or disagree with the Tea Party , Pew Research surveys found that agreement has fallen from 48 % in March 2010 to 33 % in our most recent poll conducted in late April this year . At one point agreement with the Tea Party dipped to 28 % in May 2013 , during the long budget standoff between congressional Republican leaders and the White House ."

The proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high - profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president , and more than nine - in - ten Mexicans oppose it .

Similar positivity appeared in Lebanon , with roughly three - quarters or more giving positive reviews to Christian , Sunni and Shiite religious groups .

6000,6000.png,General Support for TPP thing? Would STPP bea good thing for our country or a bad thing?,"As Congress comes to a decision on whether to give President Barack Obama broad negotiating powers on trade , our new Pew Research Center report shows that while Americans favor the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , they are among the least likely to support it in the nine TPP nations surveyed . And , as with many issues in the U.S. , there is a partisan divide on support for TPP . Overall , 49 % of Americans say that TPP would be a good thing for their country , while 29 % think it would be a bad thing . When the survey was administered in April and May , the debate over giving Obama fast - track authority — which would enhance his ability to negotiate TPP without fear of it being modified by Congress — had not yet gained the full attention of Americans . Consequently , 12 % volunteered that they had not heard enough about TPP to make a judgment , and a further 9 % did not answer the question . In general , Americans see free trade agreements as good for the country . However , support for this free trade agreement is much more robust in most other TPP nations surveyed . This includes two - thirds or more of Vietnamese ( 89 % good thing ) , Peruvians ( 70 % ) and Chileans ( 67 % ) . And at least half or more in Mexico ( 61 % ) , Japan ( 53 % ) , Australia ( 52 % ) and Canada ( 52 % ) also support the deal . In Malaysia , only 38 % support the agreement , but that is due in part to 31 % volunteering that they have not heard enough .",What is the opinion of people in different countries over TPP in their country?,"Overall , 49 % of Americans say that TPP would be a good thing for their country , while 29 % think it would be a bad thing .

Even users of home - sharing services themselves are not following this issue particularly closely : Just 19 % of home - sharing users have heard “ a lot ” about it , while 37 % have heard “ a little . ” But although home - sharing users have not been following the legal debate over these services with nearly the same intensity as their ride - hailing counterparts , those home - sharing users who have been following this issue tend to feel that these services should be both legal and tax - free for owners . Among home - sharing users who are aware of the legal debate over these services , 56 % believe that these services should be legal , and that owners should not have to pay any local hotel or lodging taxes ; just 31 % believe that owners should be able to legally rent out these services but should have to pay taxes for the privilege of doing so .",Discuss what home-sharing users have heard about its legality?,"Home - sharing services has been the subject of much debate in cities around the country .

902,902.png,Majority of college educated women say women should have children before entering politics to be successful,"Among women , there is a significant age gap in views on this issue . A majority ( 60 % ) of women ages 65 and older say a woman should have children before entering politics , while only 30 % of women ages 18 to 29 say the same . Instead , four - in - ten women ages 18 to 29 say women should wait until they ’re well established in their political careers to have children . Just one - quarter of women 65 and older say this is the best choice . Women ’s views also differ by their level of education . About four - in - ten women without a four - year college degree ( 42 % ) say a woman has the best chance of success in politics if she has children early ; 57 % of women with a bachelor ’s degree or higher say this . About one - third ( 32 % ) of less educated women , compared with 21 % of college graduates , say a woman who wants to reach high political office should wait until she is well established in her career to have children . Women who are mothers themselves have somewhat different views on this than women who do n’t have young children . Mothers of children younger than 18 are more likely than other women to say a woman who aspires to high political office should wait until she ’s established in her political career before having children . About one - third ( 36 % ) of mothers say a woman who wants to reach this type of position is better off waiting to have children , compared with 26 % of those without children under 18 .","According to the view of the mothers who have children under 18, describe their opinion on women having children while entering politics?","Mothers of children younger than 18 are more likely than other women to say a woman who aspires to high political office should wait until she ’s established in her political career before having children .
