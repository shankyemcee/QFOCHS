While the U.S. and Mexico have always had interrelated populations and Mexicans have been coming to work in the United States since the 19th century, large-scale settlement in the U.S. is a relatively recent phenomenon\u2014something that is often overlooked. As recently as 1970, Mexico had only the 4th largest foreign-born population\u2014behind Italy, Germany, and Canada. (In 1960, there were more Britons, Poles, and Russians, too.) The large increases in numbers of Mexicans actually moving to the U.S. that began in the 1960s, accelerated in the 1970s as the number of Mexicans in the U.S. tripled between 1970 and 1980. The number doubled again by 1990 and again by 2000. In 2004, the March CPS shows 10.6 million people born in Mexico. This figure represents more than a 13-fold increase over the 1970 census. Mexicans account for about 31\u201332% of all immigrants, by far the largest country of origin and more than five times the next largest population.

Similarly, about half of cell-only respondents have never been married (51%), compared with only 16% in the landline sample. In addition, the landline sample includes a higher proportion of college graduates than the cell-only group (38% vs. 26%), which may also reflect the greater use of cell phones among young people who are still in college.

From 2009 to 2012, according to recent Pew Research Center estimates, the population of unauthorized immigrants rose in seven states and fell in 14.1 Five East Coast states were among those where the number of unauthorized immigrants grew from 2009 to 2012\u2014Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Numbers also rose in Idaho and Nebraska, according to the center\u2019s estimates. (See Map 1.) Six Western states are among those with declines in unauthorized immigrant populations from 2009 to 2012\u2014Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon. Other states with decreases over that period are in the South (Alabama, Georgia and Kentucky), the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana and Kansas) and the Northeast (Massachusetts and New York). The differential growth across states is related to patterns of change in Mexican and non-Mexican unauthorized immigrant", "In my written statement , I will cover a range of research findings about unauthorized immigrants : I start with national and state trends in the size and growth of the unauthorized immigrant population . These trends are analyzed with regard to the national origins of the unauthorized immigrants , focusing on those from Mexico . Then I turn to a discussion of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. labor force and changing patterns over time . Finally , I examine the industries and occupations where unauthorized immigrants are represented with a discussion of differences across the states . This testimony draws heavily from a report the Pew Research Center released last November ( Passel and Cohn , 2014 ) and a new report we are releasing today ( Passel and Cohn , 2015 ) . The unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. peaked at 12.2 million in 2007 after growing steadily by about half a million per year from 3.5 million in 1990 . After 2007 , the trend changed abruptly and the numbers dropped dramatically by about 1 million over the next two years to 11.3 million in 2009 as the number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving plummeted and large numbers left the country . Since 2009 , the national unauthorized immigrant population has remained essentially unchanged as arrivals and departures have come into rough balance . ( See Figure 1 . ) From 1990 to 2007 , the number of unauthorized immigrants increased in every state , but growth was slower in the six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations than in the rest of the nation as a whole . California , the state with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants in all years , experienced the largest numerical growth , but its 88 % increase from 1990 to 2007 was slower than that of other large states and nearly all smaller states . As a group , the other five largest states ( Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , New York and Texas ) experienced growth in their unauthorized immigrant population at the national average of 250 % over the period .

(Total fertility rates represent the average lifetime fertility of a woman as measured in a given year; replacement level TFR is about 2.05- 2.1.) The TFR in Mexico, according to CONAPO (National Population Council of Mexico) surveys, is less than one-third of what it was in 1960 as fertility has dropped from over 7 children per woman to about 2.4 in 2000, or just over replacement level. Most population projections assume that fertility will continue to fall from 2000 levels. Both the United Nations and CONAPO assume that the Mexican TFR will ultimately reach 1.85, but the CONAPO projections assume a steeper drop. U.S. Census Bureau projections for Mexico assume the TFR will fall to 2.0. Mexican immigrants in the U.S. actually have higher fertility than all Mexican women by almost one child per woman (3.3 versus 2.4).
